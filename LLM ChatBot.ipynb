For details and reasons why I liked Professor\\nMohan’s book and why I recommended it then, please refer to my previous foreword below. My positive reaction to theprevious Edition probably gives some clues on why I accepted the second invitation, this time to introduce the Sixth Editionto new students of Pathology and other potential readers.\\nGreat French writer André Gide once said “le problème n’est pas comment réussir mais comment durer”, which in\\ntranslation to English means: The problem is not how to succeed but how to last. The fact that Dr Mohan’s book has reachedits Sixth Edition is the best sign that you are holding in your hands a very successful book, and probably one of the medicalbestsellers published on the Indian subcontinent. Up to now, it has been used by thousands of students and I am sure that itwill continue to be read and cherished in the new Edition as well.\\nFor the Sixth Edition, Dr Mohan has partially restructured the book, substantially revised it, and updated the text wherever\\nit was necessary. Following the advances of basic sciences and clinical pathology, the revisions and addition are most evidentin portions pertaining to molecular biology and genetics. Other aspects of modern pathology have not been neglected eitherand contain numerous novelties; even the seasoned specialists will learn something new from each and every chapter.Furthermore, the author has dramatically increased the number of illustrations, which are so essential for understandingPathology. The distribution of illustrations has also been changed so that they are now much closer to the text to which theyrelate.\\nFor the new generation of modern students who have grown up next to the computers, the author has placed all the\\nimages and tables on the website with facility for downloading them. These images will serve the twin purpose of quickreview and self-assessment for students and will appeal to Pathology teachers who could use them for their lectures, beingassured that their students will have access to the same material for review and study. The Quick Review Book, the everpopular companion to the previous two Editions, was also updated, succinctly supplementing the main text. It will providea helpful study material to many a student and help them review the subject for examinations.\\nIn summary, it is my distinct pleasure and honour to most enthusiastically endorse the new edition of an established\\ntextbook and salute its publication. Dr Mohan deserves kudos for the job well done and for providing the medical studentswith such an attractive, modern, up-to-date and useful Textbook of Pathology.\\nIvan Damjanov , \\nMD, PhD\\nProfessor of Pathology\\nForeword to the Fifth EditionForeword to the Fifth EditionForeword to the Fifth EditionForeword to the Fifth EditionForeword to the Fifth Edition\\nAs the Book Review Editor of the journal Modern Pathology, the official journal of the United States-Canadian Academy of Pathology I am\\nused to receiving medical books. These books are sent to my office from publishers, with a standard request for a potential review in theJournal. Nevertheless a recent package from New Delhi caught me by surprise.\\nAs you already might have guessed, the parcel contained a copy of the 5th Edition of the Textbook of Pathology  written by Professor\\nHarsh Mohan, together with the Second Edition of the pocket size companion Pathology Quick Review and MCQs . Included was also a\\nfriendly letter from Mr JP Vij, the Publisher. I acknowledged the receipt of the books by email, and also congratulated the Publisher on a jobwell done. A brief electronic exchange between Kansas City and New Delhi ensued, whereupon Mr Vij asked me to write a foreword for theReprint of 5th Edition of the Textbook. I accepted the invitation with pleasure.\\nEven though there were no specific instructions attached to the request, I assumed that I should address my notes primarily to\\nundergraduate and graduate students of Pathology. Furthermore, I decided to write the Foreword in the form of answers to the qu estions\\nthat I would have had if I were a medical student entering the field of Pathology. I hope that these hypothetical questions and  answers of\\nmine will be of interest to the readers of this Textbook.\\nQuestion 1:  Is this a good book?\\nAnswer: Yes. This is a modern Textbook written by an expert who knows his pathology; an experienced teacher who knows what is\\nimportant and what is not, and who has obviously taught pathology for many years; a well informed academician who is au courant  with\\nmodern trends in medical education, and knows how to present pathology as a preparatory step for future clinical education of m edical\\nstudents.Question 2: How does the book compare with the leading textbooks of pathology in the USA, Great Britain and Germany?\\nAnswer: Very favorably. This Indian Textbook covers more or less the same topics as the equivalent Textbooks currently used in the\\nWestern Hemisphere. Like the Western textbooks it covers the traditional fields of General and Systemic Pathology: one-third of  the bookForewordviiiTextbook of Pathologyis devoted to General Pathology, whereas the remaining two-thirds cover Systemic Pathology. The emphasis is on classical anatomic\\npathology. In that respect the Indian textbook resembles more the European than the American textbooks, which have become more\\nclinically-oriented. In my opinion this approach gives excellent results, but only if the students have enough time to devote to Pathology. Inmost US medical schools this is not the case any more, and thus pathology is not taught as extensively as before. Histopathology has beendeleted from most curricula, and most American medical students do not know to use efficiently the microscope, which is unfortu nate.\\nQuestion 3: Is the material presented in a “student-friendly” manner?\\nAnswer: The material is presented in a systematic manner in the best tradition of classical British textbooks, a tradition that can be traced to\\nthe classical writers of ancient Greece and Rome. This time tested teaching will be most appreciated by students who are methodical and donot take shortcuts in their effort to acquire encyclopedic knowledge of pathology. On the other hand, even if your learning method is basedon “cherry-picking”, i.e. you concentrate only on the most important facts in each chapter, the structure of the text will allow you to do itquite easily as well. There are no ideal books that would satisfy everybody in every respect, but there is no doubt that Professor Mohan’s\\nbook is close to ideal for a classical pathology course and I predict that it will be popular with many students.\\nQuestion 4: What are the most salient features of this textbook?\\nAnswer: Clear writing. As we all know clear writing reflects clear thinking, and clear thinking in my opinion, is an absolute prerequisite for\\ngood teaching. Judging from the book at hand, Professor Mohan (whom I do not know personally) is not only a clear thinker, but he must\\nbe also an exceptionally talented teacher.\\nClear and visually pleasing presentation . The exposition is logical and well structured. Each chapter is subdivided into smaller entities,\\nwhich are further divided into paragraphs, ideally suited for easy reading. Color coded headings and the added emphasis in form of words\\nprinted in bold or capital letters are additional attractions that facilitate learning.\\nExceptionally good illustrations, flow-charts and tables . Unique to this Textbook are the numerous hand-drawn color illustrations, including\\nmany renditions of histopathologic slides. These drawings are simple, but to the point and well annotated. Students will most l ikely\\nunderstand them much easier than the relatively impersonal original microphotographs of the same histopathologic lesions. Flow- charts\\nare most efficiently used to explicate the pathogenesis of various lesions or the pathophysiology of disease processes. The tables are good\\nfor classifications and comparative listings of closely related diseases and their pathologic features.\\nCompanion pocket book  (baby-book of pathology). I always recommend to my students to buy a major textbook and a smaller review book\\ncontaining a digest of the most important concepts; or a book of questions and answers, so that the student could test his/her knowledge of\\npathology and the understanding of the material in the main textbook. I was pleased to see that Professor Mohan shares my teach ing\\nphilosophy and has taken upon himself to prepare for his students a shorter version of main text. This pocket book is also garnered withreview questions.\\nThe medical students are thus getting a bargain— two books for the price of one. At the same time, they have a unique opportunity to\\nsee, from the example set by their teacher, on how the same material can be approached from two points of view, and presented in twoformats. The old adage, that you have never learned anything unless you have seen it at least from two sides, is clearly illustrated here. Forthe students of medicine the message is clear: if you understand the material presented in both the shorter and the longer version you can\\nbe assured that you know your Pathology inside out; and you are ready for the final examination and clinical training.\\nQuestion 5: Do I have to know all that is in this book for my final examination?\\nAnswer: No!! This is the most common question my students ask me and I hope that you believe me when I say that you do not have to\\nknow it all. First of all, neither I nor Professor Mohan know it all. Second, few of us have photographic memory and infinite s torage space\\nin our brains and thus even theoretically, very few of us could learn this book by heart. I can assure you that the book was not written for\\nthose geniuses, but for the average persons like most of us. Third, your goal should not be to memorize all the facts listed in  the textbook,\\nbut rather to understand the main concepts. Since the concepts cannot be fully understood or taught without specific examples, by necessityyou will have to learn “some nitty-gritty details”. The more details you know, the deeper your understanding of the basic concepts will be.Memorizing the details without the understanding of concepts that hold them together is not something that I would recommend. T he\\nbeauty of it all is that you can decide for yourself how deep to dig in, when to stop, what to keep and memorize, and what to eliminate. And\\nremember, deciding on what to eliminate is almost as important as choosing what to retain. As the educational gurus teach us, that is the\\ngist of what they call active learning. And to repeat again, this Textbook is ideally suited for that approach.\\nAt the end, let me repeat how excited I was perusing this excellent book. I hope that you will be similarly excited and I hope that it will\\ninspire in you enthusiasm for Pathology.\\nRemember also the words of the great clinician William Osler, one of the founders of modern medicine in late 19th and early 20t h\\nCentury, who said that our clinical practice will be only as good as our understanding of Pathology.\\nI hope that I have answered most of the questions that you might have had while opening this book. If you have any additional\\nquestions that I did not anticipate, please feel free to send me an email at idamjano@kumc.edu. Good luck!\\nIvan Damjanov, \\nMD, PhD\\nProfessor of Pathology\\nThe University of Kansas School of Medicine\\nKansas City, Kansas, USA\\nDr Damjanov is Professor of Pathology at the University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, Kansas, USA. He earned his Medical degree fromthe University of Zagreb, Croatia in 1964, and a PhD degree in Experimental Pathology from the same University in 1970. He received his Pathologytraining in Cleveland, New York and Philadelphia. Thereafter he served as Professor of Pathology at the University of Connecticut, Farmington, Connecticut,Hahnemann University and Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For the last ten years he has been on the Faculty of the University\\nof Kansas School of Medicine dividing his time between teaching, practice of surgical pathology and medical publishing. He is the author of more than 300\\nbiomedical articles, and has written or edited more than 20 medical books.ixPreface PrefacePreface PrefacePreface\\nThe overwhelming success and all-round acceptance of the last edition of the textbook was very encouraging and quite\\nstimulating but at the same time put an onerous responsibility and expectation to do better in the new edition than the bestof last edition.  In preparing 6th revised edition of my Textbook of Pathology , I pursued this goal with profound enthusiasm\\nand passionate zeal. I am, thus, pleased to present to users a wholly transformed appearance and updated contents in therevised edition. While full colour printing had been introduced in the last edition 5 years back maturing the book into aninternational edition, the present redesigned and revised edition has utlilised the contemporary technological advances in itsfull form in illustrations, lay-out and in printing. The revised edition has almost thrice the number of illustrations of largenumber of common diseases placed along with the text, and it is hoped that it will enhance understanding and learning of thesubject readily, besides being a visual treat.\\nIn recent times, advances in genetics, immunology and molecular biology have heightened our understanding of the\\nmechanisms of diseases. As a result, mention of ‘idiopathic’ in etiology and pathogenesis of most diseases in the literature isslowly disappearing. Surely, the students of current times need to be enlightened on these modern advances in diseases;these aspects have been dealt in the revised edition with a simple and lucid approach.\\nSome of the Key Features  of the Sixth Edition are as follows:\\nThorough Textual Revision and Updating: All the chapters and topics have undergone thorough revision and updating of\\nvarious aspects, including contemporary diagnostic modalities. While most of the newer information has been insertedbetween the lines, a few topics have been rewritten, e.g. current concepts on cell injury, immunopathology, carcinogenesis,newer infectious diseases, lymphomas-leukaemias, hypertension, interstitial lung diseases, etc. to name a few.  In doing so,\\nthe basic accepted style of the book —simple, easy-to-understand and reproduce the subject matter, and emphasis on clarityand accuracy, has not been disturbed. Past experience has shown that the readers find tables on contrasting features andlisting of salient features as a very useful medium for quick learning; considering their utility 15 new tables have been addedin different chapters in the revised edition.\\nReorganisation of the Book:  In a departure from the conventional division of study of the subject into General and\\nSystemic Pathology, the revised edition has been reorganised into 3 major sections—General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\n(Chapters 1 to 11), Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues (Chapters 12 to 14) and Systemic Pathology (Chapters 15 to30), followed by Appendix (containing Normal Values), Further Readings for references and Index. In my consideredjudgement, a separate section on haematology and lymphoid tissues and redistribution of their subtopics was necessitatedfor two reasons— firstly , reclassification of leukaemias-lymphomas by the WHO as an integrated topic, making the segregation\\nof study of diseases of ‘circulating’ and ‘tissue’ leucocytes superfluous; and secondly , due to advances in haematology,\\ntransfusion medicine and diseases of lymphoreticular tissues, these subspecialties of pathology have developed a lot inrecent times, requiring the students to focus on them separately for learning and they are evaluated too on these topics byseparate experts. Similarly, in the revised edition, two chapters on laboratory techniques—Techniques for the Study ofPathology (Chapter 2) and Basic Diagnostic Cytology (Chapter 11) have been included in Section-I in view of technologicaladvances in pathology which have gone beyond remaining confined as research tool but have increasingly become part ofdiagnostic work-up.\\nProfusely Illustrated: Majority of illustrations in the revised Edition are new additions while a few old ones have been done\\nagain. All the line-drawing and schematic cartoons have been updated and improved in content as well as their presentation\\nby preparing them again on CorelDraw in soft colours, eliminating the shortcomings noticed in them in previous edition. Allfree-hand labelled sketches of gross specimens and line-drawings of microscopic features of an entity have been placedalongside the corresponding specimen photograph and the photomicrograph respectively, enhancing the understanding ofthe subject for the beginner students in pathology. In doing so, the number of figures has gone up by about three-folds in thepresent edition, some incorporated as an inset with focus on a close-up microscopic view.\\nTruly User-friendly: Rational use of various levels of headings and subheadings in different colours, bold face and in italics\\nhas been done in the text in order to highlight key points. All the citations of figures and tables in the text have been shown\\nin colour now to make the related text vividly visible and to help user locate the same quickly on a page. It is hoped that thesefeatures will enable the user with rapid revision at the end of a topic, making the book truly user-friendly.\\nMuch More Content but Unaltered Volume: While the new edition has a lot more updated textual material, more tables and\\na marked increase in the number of figures than the previous edition, a meticulous and rational page management hashelped in retaining almost the same girth of the book as before.PrefacexTextbook of PathologyImages and Tables on the Web: All the illustrations and tables included in this edition are being put on the website with a\\nscratch key word on the inner page of the cover jacket. The students would find these useful for quick review and for self-\\nassessment in which an unlabelled image (gross specimen or a photomicrograph) appears, followed by the labelled imagewith diagnosis corresponding to the same figure and table in the textbook. Besides, ready availability of these downloadableimages and tables would be useful to fellow teachers for possibly including the same in their lectures.\\nRevised Pathology Quick Review and MCQs: The sixth edition of textbook is accompanied with the new revised baby-book\\npopular with many students and interns. This small book has been found profoundly useful by the students just before\\npractical examination to face viva voce when they need to revise huge course content in a short time, or by those preparing to\\ntake postgraduate entrance examinations.  The revised edition has over 100 more new MCQs while some old ones haveeither been edited or replaced.\\nA Word on Foreword: The Foreword  by Prof Ivan Damjanov, \\nMD, PhD , from Kansas University, US, for the previous edition\\nand now for the sixth edition so generously and meticulously prepared with an eye to the details of the book, has been most\\nwelcome development, and has helped to bring the book closer to users in other parts of the world; I express our sinceregratitude to this eminent teacher and well-known author whom I have yet to meet in person.\\nIn essence, the revised edition is a comprehensive text of pathology meant primarily for students of pathology; however,\\nthe practicing clinicians and students of other branches of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, alternate system of medicine, andparamedical courses may also find it useful.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThe revision work was indeed a mammoth task to accomplish and would not have been possible without active cooperationfrom friends and colleagues and continuous encouragement from well-wishers in general, and my departmental staff inparticular who could bear with me for prolonged spells of my sabbatical leave. All the photomicrographs included in thepresent edition have been exposed afresh which has been made possible by the most valuable and selfless assistance renderedby my colleagues, Drs Shailja, Tanvi and Ujjawal, Senior Residents in Pathology, all of whom worked tirelessly for endlesshours for months, much to the sacrifice of their personal comfort and time of their families, for which I am indebted to them.Here, I also recall the help accorded by my former students and colleagues in preparation of earlier editions of the book andthank once again, even though much of that may have been replaced. As always, I remain indebted to those from whom I hadthe opportunity to learn pathology; in particular to Prof K Joshi, \\nMD, PhD, PGIMER , Chandigarh, Late Prof TS Jaswal, MD, and\\nProf Uma Singh, MD, formerly at PGIMS, Rohtak.\\nConstant strategic support and encouragement extended by the Department of Medical Education and Research,\\nChandigarh Administration, during the completion of work is gratefully acknowledged.\\nI may have been hard-task master and highly demanding on quality and accuracy from all staff members of the\\nM/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd, at times losing my patience, but all of them have been very cooperativeand quite accommodating. In particular, I would like to thank profusely Mr Manoj Pahuja, Computer Art Designer, forcarrying out Herculean job on figures as per my requirements conscientiously and patiently with competence;Mrs Y Kapoor, Senior Desktop Operator, for overall lay-out of the book and acceding to all my requests for amendmentssmilingly and ungrudgingly till the very last minute; and Ms Chetna Malhotra, \\nMBA, Senior Business Development Manager,\\nfor overseeing the entire project vigilantly and efficiently. All through this period, Mr Tarun Duneja, (Director-Publishing),M/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd, has been highly cooperative and supportive.\\nLastly, the vision of Shri JP Vij, Chairman and Managing Director of M/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd, has\\nbeen to see the revised edition as unmatched internationally and keeping it affordable at the same time, much above hisbusiness interests, and I do hope his dream comes true. Full credit goes to M/s Ajanta Printers, Faridabad, for the admirablyhigh quality of printing.\\nFinally, the users of previous editions are gratefully acknowledged for having brought this textbook at this pedestal. In\\nthe past, I have gained profitably by suggestions from colleagues and students and I urge them to continue giving theirvaluable suggestions and point out errors, if any, so that I may continue to improve it.\\nGovernment Medical College Harsh Mohan,  \\nMD, MNAMS, FICPath, FUICC\\nSector-32 A, Chandigarh-160031 Professor & Head\\nINDIA Department of Pathology\\nE mail:

‘Pathology’ is derived from two Greek words— pathos\\nmeaning suffering, and logos  meaning study. Pathology is, thus,\\nscientific study of structure and function of the body in disease;\\nor in other words, pathology consists of the abnormalities that\\noccur in normal anatomy (including histology) and physiology\\nowing to disease. Another commonly used term with referenceto study of diseases is ‘ pathophysiology’  comprised by two words:\\npatho =suffering; physiology =study of normal function.\\nPathophysiology, thus, includes study of disordered functionor breakdown of homeostasis in diseases. Pathologists are thediagnosticians of disease. Therefore, knowledge andunderstanding of pathology is essential for all would-be doctors,\\ngeneral medical practitioners and specialists since unless they\\nknow the causes, mechanisms, nature and type of disease, andunderstand the language spoken by the pathologist in the formof laboratory reports, they would not be able to institute\\nappropriate treatment or suggest preventive measures to the\\npatient. For the student of any system of medicine, the disciplineof pathology forms a vital bridge between initial learning phaseof preclinical sciences and the final phase of clinical subjects.\\nRemember the prophetic words of one of the eminent founders\\nof modern medicine in late 19th and early 20th century, Sir\\nWilliam Osler , “Your practice of medicine will be as good as\\nyour understanding of pathology.”\\nHEALTH AND DISEASE\\nBefore there were humans on earth, there was disease, albeit in\\nearly animals. Since pathology is the study of disease, then whatis disease? In simple language, disease is opposite of health i.e.\\nwhat is not healthy is disease. Health  may be defined as a\\ncondition when the individual is in complete accord with thesurroundings, while disease is loss of ease (or comfort) to the\\nbody (i.e. dis-ease). However, it must be borne in mind that inhealth there is a wide range of ‘normality’ e.g. in height, weight,\\nblood and tissue chemical composition etc. It also needs to beappreciated that at cellular level, the cells display wide rangeof activities within the broad area of health similar to what isseen in diseased cells. Thus, health and disease are not absolutebut are considered as relative states.A term commonly confused with disease is illness.  While\\ndisease suggests an entity with a cause, illness is the reactionof the individual to disease in the form of symptoms(complaints of the patient) and physical signs (elicited bythe clinician). Though disease and illness are not separable,the study of diseases is done in pathology while the learningand management of illnesses is done in wards and clinics.\\nIn addition to disease and illness, there are syndromes\\n(meaning running together) characterised by combinationof symptoms caused by altered physiologic processes.\\nTERMINOLOGY IN PATHOLOGY\\nIt is important for a beginner in pathology to be familiar\\nwith the language used in pathology:\\nPatient is the person affected by disease.\\nLesions  are the characteristic changes in tissues and cells\\nproduced by disease in an individual or experimentalanimal.\\nPathologic changes  or morphology  consist of examination\\nof diseased tissues.\\nPathologic changes can be recognised with the naked\\neye (gross or macroscopic changes)  or studied by microscopic\\nexamination of tissues.\\nCausal factors responsible for the lesions are included\\nin etiology  of disease (i.e. ‘why’ of disease).\\nMechanism by which the lesions are produced is termed\\npathogenesis  of disease (i.e. ‘how’ of disease).\\nFunctional implications of the lesion felt by the patient\\nare symptoms  and those discovered by the clinician are the\\nphysical signs.\\nClinical significance of the morphologic and functional\\nchanges together with results of other investigations helpto arrive at an answer to what is wrong (diagnosis), what is\\ngoing to happen (prognosis),  what can be done about it\\n(treatment) , and finally what should be done to avoid\\ncomplications and spread (prevention)  (i.e. ‘what’ of disease).\\nEVOLUTION OF PATHOLOGY\\nPathology as the scientific study of disease processes hasits deep roots in medical history. Since the beginning of2\\nSECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesmankind, there has been desire as well as need to know more\\nabout the causes, mechanisms and nature of diseases. Theanswers to these questions have evolved over the centuries—from supernatural beliefs to the present state of ourknowledge of modern pathology. However, pathology is notseparable from other multiple disciplines of medicine andowes its development to interaction and interdependence onadvances in diverse neighbouring branches of science, inaddition to the strides made in medical technology. As weshall see in the pages that follow, pathology has evolved overthe years as a distinct discipline from anatomy, medicine andsurgery, in that sequence.\\nThe brief review of fascinating history of pathology and\\nits many magnificent personalities with their outstandingcontribution in the opening pages of the book is meant to payour obeisance to those great personalities who have laidglorious foundations of our speciality. Life and works of thosewhose names are mentioned below are linked to some diseaseor process—the aim being to stimulate the inquisitive beginnerin pathology as to how this colourful specialty has emerged.\\nFROM RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND\\nMAGIC TO RA TIONAL  \\nAPPROACH\\n(PREHISTORIC TIME TO AD 1500)\\nPresent-day knowledge of primitive culture prevalent in theworld in prehistoric times reveals that religion, magic andmedical treatment were quite linked to each other in thosetimes. The earliest concept of disease understood by thepatient and the healer was the religious belief that diseasewas the outcome of ‘curse from God’ or the belief in magicthat the affliction had supernatural origin from ‘evil eye ofspirits.’ To ward them off, priests through prayers andsacrifices, and magicians by magic power used to act as faith-healers and invoke supernatural powers and please the gods.Remnants of ancient superstitions still exist in some parts ofthe world. The link between medicine and religion becameso firmly established throughout the world that differentsocieties had their gods and goddesses of healing; for example:mythological Greeks had Asclepios  and Apollo  as the principal\\ngods of healing, Dhanvantri  as the deity of medicine in India,\\nand orthodox Indians’ belief in Mata Sheetala Devi as the poxgoddess.\\nThe period of ancient religious and magical beliefs was\\nfollowed by the philosophical and rational approach to diseaseby the methods of observations. This happened at the timewhen great Greek philosophers—Socrates, Plato and Aristotle,\\nintroduced philosophical concepts to all natural phenomena.\\nBut the real practice of medicine began with Hippocrates\\n(460–370 \\nBC), the great Greek clinical genius of all times and\\nregarded as ‘the father of medicine’ (Fig. 1.1) . Hippocrates\\nfollowed rational and ethical attitudes in practice and teachingof medicine as expressed in the collection of writings of thatera. He firmly believed in study of patient’s symptoms anddescribed methods of diagnosis. The prevailing concept ofmechanism of disease based on disequilibrium of four basichumors (water, air, fire, and earth) was propagated byHippocates too. He recorded his observations on cases inwriting which remained the mainstay of medicine for nearlytwo thousand years (Hippocratic aphorism). Some of themajor Hippocratic methods can be summarised as under:\\nObserve all objectively.\\nStudy the patient rather than the disease.\\nEvaluate honestly.\\nAssist nature.\\nHippocrates introduced ethical concepts in the practice\\nof medicine and is revered by the medical profession by taking‘Hippocratic oath’  at the time of entry into practice of medicine.\\nGreek medicine after Hippocrates reached Rome (now\\nItaly), which controlled Greek world after 146 \\nBC and therefore\\ndominated the field of development of medicine in ancientEurope then. In fact, since ancient times, many tongue-twisting terminologies in medicine have their origin fromLatin language which was the official language of countriesincluded in ancient Roman empire (Spanish, Portugese,Italian, French and Greek languages have their origin fromLatin).\\nHippocratic teaching was propagated in Rome by Roman\\nphysicians, notably by Cornelius Celsus  (53 \\nBC-7 AD) and\\nCladius Galen  (130–200 AD). Celsus first described four cardinal\\nsigns of inflammation—rubor (redness), tumor (swelling),calor (heat), and dolor (pain).  Galen postulated humoral\\ntheory, later called Galenic theory. This theory suggested thatthe illness resulted from imbalance between four humors  (or\\nbody fluids): blood, lymph, black bile (believed to be fromthe spleen), and biliary secretion from the liver.\\nThe hypothesis of disequilibrium of four elements consti-\\ntuting the body (Dhatus) similar to Hippocratic doctrine finds\\nmention in ancient Indian medicine books compiled about200 \\nAD—Charaka Samhita , a finest document by Charaka on\\nFigure 1.1 Hippocrates (460-370 BC). The great Greek clinical\\ngenius and regarded as ‘the father of medicine’.  He introduced ethical\\naspects to medicine.3CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Pathologymedicine listing 500 remedies, and Sushruta Samhita, similar\\nbook of surgical sciences by Sushruta , and includes about 700\\nplant-derived medicines.\\nThe end of Medieval period was marked by backward\\nsteps in medicine. There were widespread and devastating\\nepidemics which reversed the process of rational thinkingagain to supernatural concepts and divine punishment for‘sins.’ The dominant belief during this period was that lifewas due to influence of vital substance under the control ofsoul (theory of vitalism) . Thus, dissection of human body was\\nstrictly forbidden as that would mean hurting the ‘soul.’\\nFROM HUMAN ANATOMY TO ERA OF\\nGROSS P ATHOLOGY\\n (AD 1500 to 1800)\\nThe backwardness of Medieval period was followed by theRenaissance period i.e. revival of leaning. The Renaissancebegan from Italy in late 15th century and spread to whole ofEurope. During this period, there was quest for advances inart and science. Since there was freedom of thought, therewas emphasis on philosophical and rational attitudes again.\\nThe beginning of the development of human anatomy\\ntook place during this period with the art works and drawingsof human muscles and embryos by famous Italian painterLeonardo da Vinci (1452–1519). Dissection of human body wasstarted by Vesalius  (1514–1564) on executed criminals. His\\npupils, Gabriel Fallopius (1523–1562) who described human\\noviducts (Fallopian tubes) and Fabricius  who discovered\\nlymphoid tissue around the intestine of birds (bursa ofFabricius) further popularised the practice of human anatomicdissection for which special postmortem amphitheatres camein to existence in various parts of ancient Europe (Fig. 1.2) .\\nAntony  van Leeuwenhoek  (1632–1723), a cloth merchant by\\nprofession in Holland, during his spare time invented the firstever microscope by grinding the lenses himself through whichhe recognised male spermatozoa as tiny preformed men (or“homunculi”) and blood corpuscles. He also introducedhistological staining in 1714 using saffron to examine musclefibres.Marcello Malpighi  (1624–1694) used microscope extensively\\nand observed the presence of capillaries and described themalpighian layer of the skin, and lymphoid tissue in the spleen(malpighian corpuscles). Malpighi is known as ‘the father ofhistology.’\\nThe credit for beginning of the study of morbid anatomy\\n(pathologic anatomy), however, goes to Italian anatomist-pathologist, Giovanni B. Morgagni  (1682–1771). Morgagni was\\nan excellent teacher in anatomy, a prolific writer and apracticing clinician. By his work, Morgagni demolished theancient humoral theory of disease and published his life-timeexperiences based on 700 postmortems and theircorresponding clinical findings. He, thus, laid the foundationsof clinicopathologic methodology in the study of disease andintroduced the concept of clinicopathologic correlation (CPC),establishing a coherent sequence of cause, lesions, symptoms,and outcome of disease (Fig. 1.3) .\\nSir Percival Pott  (1714–1788), famous surgeon in England,\\nidentified the first ever occupational cancer in the chimneysweeps in 1775 and discovered chimney soot as the firstcarcinogenic agent. However, the study of anatomy inEngland during the latter part of 18th Century wasdominated by the two Hunter brothers: John Hunter  (1728–\\n1793), a student of Sir Percival Pott, rose to become greatestsurgeon-anatomist of all times and he, together with his elderbrother William Hunter  (1718–1788) who was a reputed\\nanatomist-obstetrician (or man-midwife), started the firstever museum of pathologic anatomy. John Hunter made acollection of more than 13,000 surgical specimens from hisflourishing practice, arranged them into separate organsystems, made comparison of specimens from animals andplants with humans, and included many clinical pathologyspecimens as well, and thus developed the first museum ofcomparative anatomy and pathology in the world whichbecame the Hunterian Museum, now housed in RoyalCollege of Surgeons of London \\n(Fig.  1.4) . Amongst many\\npupils of John Hunter was Edward Jenner  (1749–1823) whose\\nwork on inoculation in smallpox is well known. Anotherprominent English pathologist was Matthew Baillie (1760–\\n1823), nephew of Hunter brothers, who published first-eversystematic textbook of morbid anatomy in 1793. The era ofgross pathology had three more illustrious and brilliantphysician-pathologists in England who were colleagues atGuy’s Hospital in London:\\nRichard Bright  (1789–1858) who described non-\\nsuppurative nephritis, later termed glomerulonephritis orBright’s disease;\\nThomas Addison  (1793–1860) who gave an account of\\nchronic adrenocortical insufficiency termed Addison’sdisease; and\\nThomas Hodgkin (1798–1866), who observed the complex\\nof chronic enlargement of lymph nodes, often withenlargement of the liver and spleen, later called Hodgkin’sdisease.\\nTowards the end of 18th century, Xavier Bichat\\n(1771–1802) in France described that organs were composedof tissue and divided the study of morbid anatomy intoGeneral Pathology and Systemic Pathology. R.T.H. Laennec\\n(1781–1826), another French physician, dominated the early\\nFigure 1.2 In 16th Century, postmortem amphitheatre in Europe\\nwas a place of learning human anatomic dissection conducted and\\ndemonstrated by professors to eager learners and spectators.4\\nSECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\npart of 19th century by his numerous discoveries. He\\ndescribed several lung diseases (tubercles, caseous lesions,miliary lesions, pleural effusion, bronchiectasis), chronicsclerotic liver disease (later called Laennec’s cirrhosis) and\\ninvented stethoscope.\\nMorbid anatomy attained its zenith with appearance of\\nCarl F. von Rokitansky  (1804–1878), self-taught German\\npathologist who performed nearly 30,000 autopsies himself.\\nHe described acute yellow atrophy of the liver, wrote anoutstanding monograph on diseases of arteries andcongenital heart defects. Unlike most other surgeons of thattime, Rokitansky did not do clinical practice of surgery butinstead introduced the concept that pathologists shouldconfine themselves to making diagnosis which became theaccepted role of pathologist later.\\nERA OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND\\nCELLULAR P ATHOLOGY\\n (AD 1800 TO 1950s)\\nUp to middle of the 19th century, correlation of clinicalmanifestations of disease with gross pathological findingsat autopsy became the major method of study of disease.Sophistication in surgery led to advancement in pathology.The anatomist-surgeons of earlier centuries got replacedlargely with surgeon-pathologists in the 19th century.\\nPathology started developing as a diagnostic discipline\\nin later half of the 19th century with the evolution of cellularpathology which was closely linked to technologyadvancements in machinery manufacture for cutting thinsections of tissue, improvement in microscope, anddevelopment of chemical industry and dyes for staining.\\nThe discovery of existence of disease-causing micro-\\norganisms was made by French chemist Louis Pasteur\\n(1822–1895), thus demolishing the prevailing theory ofspontaneous generation of disease and firmly establishedgerm theory of disease. Subsequently, G.H.A. Hansen\\n(1841–1912) in Germany identified Hansen’s bacillus ascausative agent for leprosy (Hansen’s disease) in 1873. While\\nthe study of infectious diseases was being made, the concept\\nof immune tolerance and allergy emerged which formed thebasis of immunisation initiated by Edward Jenner. Ilya\\nMetchnikoff  (1845-1916), a Russian zoologist, introduced the\\nexistence of phenomenon of phagocytosis by human defensecells against invading microbes.\\nDevelopments in chemical industry helped in switch over\\nfrom earlier dyes of plant and animal origin to synthetic dyes;aniline violet being the first such synthetic dye prepared byPerkin  in 1856. This led to emergence of a viable dye industry\\nfor histological and bacteriological purposes. The impetus forthe flourishing and successful dye industry came from theworks of numerous pioneers as under:\\nPaul Ehrlich  (1854–1915), German physician, conferred Nobel\\nprize in 1908 for his work in immunology, described Ehrlich’stest for urobilinogen using Ehrlich’s aldehyde reagent, stainingtechniques of cells and bacteria, and laid the foundations ofclinical pathology (Fig. 1.5) .\\nChristian Gram (1853–1938), Danish physician, who\\ndeveloped bacteriologic staining by crystal violet.\\nD.L. Romanowsky (1861–1921), Russian physician, who\\ndeveloped stain for peripheral blood film using eosin andmethylene blue derivatives.\\nRobert Koch  (1843–1910), German bacteriologist who, besides\\nKoch’s postulate and Koch’s phenomena, developed techniquesof fixation and staining for identification of bacteria, discoveredtubercle bacilli in 1882 and cholera vibrio organism in 1883.\\nMay-Grunwald in 1902 and Giemsa  in 1914 developed blood\\nstains and applied them for classification of blood cells and bonemarrow cells.\\nFigure 1.3 Giovanni B.

Schwann  (1810–1882), the first\\nneurohistologist, and Claude Bernarde (1813–1878), pioneer in\\npathophysiology.\\nUntil the end of the 19th century, the study of morbid\\nanatomy had remained largely autopsy-based and thus hadremained a retrospective science. Rudolf Virchow (1821–1905) in\\nGermany is credited with the beginning of microscopicexamination of diseased tissue at cellular level and thus beganhistopathology as a method of investigation. Virchow gave twomajor hypotheses:\\nAll cells come from other cells.\\nDisease is an alteration of normal structure and function of\\nthese cells.\\nVirchow came to be referred as Pope in pathology in Europe\\nand is aptly known as the ‘father of cellular pathology’(Fig. 1.6) . Thus, sound foundation of diagnostic pathology had\\nbeen laid which was followed and promoted by numerousbrilliant successive workers. Thus, knowledge and skill gainedby giving accurate diagnosis on postmortem findings startedbeing applied to surgical biopsy and thus emerged the disciplineof surgical pathology. Virchow also described etiology ofembolism (Virchow’s triad—slowing of blood-stream, changesin the vessel wall, changes in the blood itself), metastatic spreadof tumours (Virchow’s lymph node), and components anddiseases of blood ( fibrinogen, leukocytosis, \\nleukaemia).\\nThe concept of frozen section examination when the\\npatient was still on the operation table was introduced byVirchow’s student, Julius Cohnheim (1839–1884). In fact,\\nduring the initial period of development of surgicalpathology around the turn of the 19th century, frozensection was considered more acceptable by the surgeons.Then there was the period when morphologic examinationof cells by touch imprint smears was favoured for diagnosticpurposes than actual tissue sections. Subsequently, furtheradvances in surgical pathology were made possible byimproved machinery and development of dyes and stains.\\nThe concept of surgeon and physician doubling up in\\nthe role of pathologist which started in the 19th centurycontinued as late as the middle of the 20th century in mostclinical departments. Assigning biopsy pathology work tosome faculty member in the clinical department wascommon practice; that is why some of the notablepathologists of the first half of 20th century had backgroundof clinical training e.g. James Ewing  (1866–1943), A.P. Stout\\n(1885–1967) and Lauren Ackerman (1905–1993) in US, Pierre\\nMasson  (1880–1958) in France, and RA Willis in Australia.\\nA few other landmarks in further evolution of modern\\npathology in this era are as follows:\\nKarl Landsteiner (1863–1943) described the existence of\\nmajor human blood groups in 1900 and was awarded Nobelprize in 1930 and is considered father of blood transfusion(Fig.  1.7) .\\nRuska and Lorries in 1933 developed electron microscope\\nwhich aided the pathologist to view ultrastructure of celland its organelles.\\nThe development of exfoliative cytology for early\\ndetection of cervical cancer began with George N. Papanicolaou\\n(1883–1962), a Greek-born American pathologist, in 1930swho is known as ‘father of exfoliative cytology’ (Fig. 1.8) .\\nFigure 1.6 Rudolf Virchow (1821-1905).\\nGerman pathologist who proposed cellular\\ntheory of disease.Figure 1.7 Carl Landsteiner (1863-1943).\\nAn Austrian pathologist who first discovered theexistence of major human blood groups in 1900and was recipient of Nobel prize in 1930.Figure 1.8\\nGeorge N.

M.M. Wintrobe (1901–1986), a pupil of\\nBoyd who discovered haematocrit technique, regarded himas a very stimulating teacher with keen interest in thedevelopment of museum.\\nMODERN PATHOLOGY (1950s TO PRESENT TIMES)\\nThe strides made in the latter half of 20th century until the\\nbeginning of 21st century have made it possible to studydiseases at molecular level, and provide an evidence-basedand objective diagnosis and enable the physician to instituteappropriate therapy. The major impact of advances inmolecular biology are in the field of diagnosis and treatmentof genetic disorders, immunology and in cancer. Some ofthe revolutionary discoveries during this time are as under(Fig. 1.10):\\nDescription of the structure of DNA of the cell by Watson\\nand Crick in 1953.\\nIdentification of chromosomes and their correct number\\nin humans (46) by Tijo and Levan in 1956.\\nIdentification of Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) in\\nchronic myeloid leukaemia by Nowell and Hagerford in 1960\\nas the first chromosomal abnormality in any cancer.\\nIn Situ Hybridization  introduced in 1969 in which a\\nlabelled probe is employed to detect and localize specificRNA or DNA sequences ‘in situ’  (i.e. in the original place).\\nRecombinant DNA technique developed in 1972 using\\nrestriction enzymes to cut and paste bits of DNA.\\nIn 1983, Kary Mullis introduced polymerase chain reaction\\n(PCR) i.e. “xeroxing” DNA fragments which revolutionisedthe diagnostic molecular genetics.\\nFlexibility and dynamism of DNA invented by Barbara\\nMcClintock  for which she was awarded Nobel prize in 1983.\\nFigure 1.9 William Boyd (1885-1979).

This has set in the era of mammalian cloning.\\nReproductive cloning for human beings, however, is very riskybesides being absolutely unethical.\\nIn 1998, researchers in US found a way of harvesting stem\\ncells, a type of primitive cells, from embryos and maintainingtheir growth in the laboratory, and thus started the era of stem\\ncell research . Stem cells are seen by many researchers as having\\nvirtually unlimited application in the treatment of many human\\n7CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Pathologydiseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, cancer, strokes,\\netc. There are 2 types of sources of stem cells: embryonic stemcells and adult stem cells. Since embryonic stem cells are morenumerous, therapeutic cloning of human embryos as a source of\\nstem cells for treating some incurable diseases has been allowed\\nin some parts of the world. A time may come when by using\\nembryonic stem cells, insulin-producing cells may be introducedinto the pancreas in a patient of insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus, or stem cells may be cultured in the laboratory in lieuof a whole organ transplant. Thus, time is not far when organsfor transplant may be ‘harvested’ from the embryo in lieu of a\\nwhole organ transplant.\\nIn April 2003, Human Genome Project (HGP) consisting of\\na consortium of countries, was completed which coincided with\\n50 years of description of DNA double helix by Watson andCrick in April 1953. The sequencing of human genome  reveals that\\nhuman genome contains approximately 3 billion of the base\\npairs, which reside in the 23 pairs of chromosomes within the\\nnucleus of all human cells. Each chromosome contains anestimated 30,000 genes in the human genome, contrary to theearlier estimate of about 100,000 genes, which carry theinstructions for making proteins. The HGP gave us the abilityto read nature’s complete genetic blueprint for building each\\nhuman being. All this has opened new ways in treating and\\nresearching an endless list of diseases that are currentlyincurable. In time to come, medical scientists will be able todevelop highly effective diagnostic tools, to better understandthe health needs of people based on their individual geneticmake-ups, and to design new and highly effective treatments\\nfor disease as well as suggest prevention against disease.\\nThese inventions have set in an era of human molecular\\nbiology which is no longer confined to research laboratories but\\nis ready for application as a modern diagnostic and therapeutictool. Modern day human molecular biology is closely linked toinformation technology; the best recent example is the\\navailability of molecular profiling by cDNA microarrays  in which\\nby a small silicon chip, expression of thousands of genes can be\\nsimultaneously measured.\\nSUBDIVISIONS OF PATHOLOGY\\nAfter a retrospective into the historical aspects of pathology,\\nand before plunging into the study of diseases in the chaptersthat follow, we first introduce ourselves with the branches ofhuman pathology.\\nDepending upon the species studied, there are various\\ndisciplines of pathology such as human pathology, animalpathology, plant pathology, veterinary pathology, poultrypathology etc. Comparative pathology  deals with the study of\\ndiseases in animals in comparison with those found in man.\\nHuman pathology is the largest branch of pathology. It is\\nconventionally divided into General Pathology  dealing with\\ngeneral principles of disease, and Systemic Pathology  that\\nincludes study of diseases pertaining to the specific organs andbody systems. With the advancement of diagnostic tools, thebroad principles of which are outlined in the next chapter, thespeciality of pathology has come to include the followingsubspecialities:\\nA. HISTOPATHOLOGY.  Histopathology, used synonymously\\nwith anatomic pathology, pathologic anatomy, or morbidanatomy, is the classic method of study and still the most\\nuseful one which has stood the test of time. The studyincludes structural changes observed by naked eyeexamination referred to as gross or macroscopic changes,and the changes detected by light and electron microscopysupported by numerous special staining methods includinghistochemical and immunological techniques to arrive atthe most accurate diagnosis. Modern time anatomicpathology includes super-specialities such as cardiacpathology, pulmonary pathology, neuropathology, renalpathology, gynaecologic pathology, breast pathology,dermatopathology, gastrointestinal pathology, oralpathology, and so on. Anatomic pathology includes thefollowing 3 main subdivisions:\\n1.Surgical pathology.  It deals with the study of tissues\\nremoved from the living body. It forms the bulk of tissue\\nmaterial for the pathologist and includes study of tissue byparaffin embedding  techniques and by frozen section for rapid\\ndiagnosis.\\n2.Forensic pathology and autopsy work.  This includes\\nthe study of organs and tissues removed at postmortem\\nfor medicolegal work and for determining the underlyingsequence and cause of death. By this, the pathologistattempts to reconstruct the course of events how they mayhave happened in the patient during life which culminatedin his death. Postmortem anatomical diagnosis is helpfulto the clinician to enhance his knowledge about the diseaseand his judgement while forensic autopsy is helpful formedicolegal purposes. The significance of a carefulpostmortem examination can be summed up in the oldsaying ‘the dead teach the living’.\\n3.Cytopathology.  Though a branch of anatomic\\npathology, cytopathology has developed as a distinct\\nsubspeciality in recent times. It includes study of cells shedoff from the lesions (exfoliative cytology) and fine-needleaspiration cytology (FNAC) of superficial and deep-seatedlesions for diagnosis (Chapter 11).\\nB. HAEMATOLOGY.  Haematology deals with the diseases\\nof blood. It includes laboratory haematology and clinical\\nhaematology; the latter covers the management of patientas well.\\nC. CHEMICAL PATHOLOGY.  Analysis of biochemical\\nconstituents of blood, urine, semen, CSF and other body\\nfluids is included in this branch of pathology.\\nD. IMMUNOLOGY.  Detection of abnormalities in the\\nimmune system of the body comprises immunology and\\nimmunopathology.\\nE. EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY.  This is defined as\\nproduction of disease in the experimental animal and its\\nstudy. However, all the findings of experimental work inanimals may not be applicable to human beings due tospecies differences.\\nF. GEOGRAPHIC PATHOLOGY.  The study of differences\\nin distribution of frequency and type of diseases in\\npopulations in different parts of the world forms geographicpathology.8\\nSECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesG. MEDICAL GENETICS. This is the branch of human\\ngenetics that deals with the relationship between heredity\\nand disease. There have been important developments in\\nthe field of medical genetics e.g. in blood groups, inbornerrors of metabolism, chromosomal aberrations incongenital malformations and neoplasms etc.\\nH. MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY.  The detection and\\ndiagnosis of abnormalities at the level of DNA of the cell\\nis included in molecular pathology. Recent advancements\\nin molecular biologic techniques have resulted inavailability of these methods not only for research\\npurposes but also as a tool in diagnostic pathology.In conclusion,  i\\nt is said that specialisation makes human\\nminds strangers to each other. But the above divisions ofpathology into several specialisations are quite artificial sincepathology embraces all disciplines of medicine and thusoverlapping of specialities is likely. While in the chapters thatfollow, efforts have been made to present the entire subjectcovering diseases of the whole human body in an integratedand coordinated manner, knowledge is ever-expanding on adaily basis and the quest for learning more an ongoingprocess. Thus, all of us remain lifelong students of the art ofpathology of diseases!\\n❑9CHAPTER 2 Techniques for the Study of Pathology\\nChapter 2Techniques for\\nthe Study of PathologyChapter 2\\nFor learning contemporary pathology effectively, it is essential\\nthat the student is familiar with the various laboratorymethods, techniques and tools employed for the study ofpathology. This chapter is devoted to the basic aspects ofvarious such methods as are available in a modern pathologylaboratory—ranging from the basic microscopy to the mostrecent methods.\\nAUTOPSY PATHOLOGY\\nProfessor William Boyd in his unimitable style wrote‘Pathology had its beginning on the autopsy table’. Thesignificance of study of autopsy in pathology is summed upin Latin inscription in an autopsy room translated in Englishas “The place where death delights to serve the living’. Asstated in the previous chapter, G.B. Morgagni in Italy (1682-1771) and T.H.A. Laennec (1781-1826) in France startedcollecting the case records of hospital cases and begancorrelation of clinical features with the lesions observed atautopsy and thus marked the beginning of clinicopathologiccorrelation (CPC). CPC continues to be the most importantform of clinical teaching activity in medical institutionsworldwide.\\nThere is still no substitute for a careful postmortem\\nexamination which enlightens the clinician about the patho-genesis of disease, reveals hazardous effects of therapyadministered, and settles the discrepancies finally betweenantemortem and postmortem diagnosis.\\nTraditionally, there are two methods for carrying out\\nautopsy, either of which may be followed:1. Block extraction of abdominal and thoracic organs.2.In situ  organ-by-organ dissection.\\nIn conditions where multiple organs are expected to be\\ninvolved, complete autopsy should be performed. But if aparticular organ-specific disease is suspected, a mini-autopsyor limited autopsy may be sufficient.\\nThe study of autopsy throws new light on the knowledge\\nand skills of both physician as well as pathologist. The mainpurposes  of autopsy are as under:\\n1.Quality assurance of patientcare  by:\\ni) confirming the cause of death;\\nii)establishing the final diagnosis; and\\niii)study \\nof therapeutic response to treatment.\\n2.Education of the entire team  involved in patientcare by:\\ni) making autopsy diagnosis of conditions which are often\\nmissed clinically e.g. pneumonia, pulmonaryembolism, acute pancreatitis, carcinoma prostate;\\nii)\\ndiscovery of newer diseases made at autopsy e.g.\\nReye’s syndrome, Legionnaire’s disease, severe acuterespiratory syndrome (SARS);iii) study of demography and epidemiology of diseases;\\nand\\niv) affords education to students and staff of pathology.\\nDeclining autopsy rate  throughout world in the recent times\\nis owing to the following reasons:1.Higher diagnostic confidence made possible by advances\\nin imaging techniques e.g. CT, MRI, angiography etc.2\\n. Physician’s fear of legal liability on being wrong.\\nContinued support for advocating autopsy by caring\\nphysicians as well as by discernible pathologists in tertiary-care hospitals is essential for improved patientcare andprogress in medical science.\\nSURGICAL PATHOLOGY\\nHISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE\\nThe term surgical pathology is currently applied synony-\\nmously with histopathology, morbid anatomy, anatomicpathology and cellular pathology. Surgical pathology is theclassic and time-tested method of tissue diagnosis made ongross and microscopic study of tissues.\\nAs discussed already, surgical pathology made a\\nbeginning from pathologic study of tissues made available atautopsy. Surgeons of old times relied solely on operative orgross findings and, thereafter, discarded the excised tissues,without affording an opportunity to the pathologist to makemicroscopic diagnosis. However, with technology\\ndevelopment and advances made in the dye industry in the\\ninitial years of 20th Century, the speciality of diagnosticsurgical pathology by biopsy developed.\\nIn the beginning, this task was assigned to a surgeon\\nfaculty member in the surgery departments who wasappropriately called ‘surgical pathologist’. Currently, the field\\nof surgical pathology has expanded so much that several\\nsubspecialities have developed e.g. nephropathology,neuropathology, haematopathology, dermatopathology,gynaecologic pathology cytopathology, paediatric pathology,and so on.\\nSCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY\\nSurgical pathology services in any large hospital depend\\nlargely on inputs from surgeons and physicians familiar withthe scope and limitations inherent in the speciality. Thus it isvital that clinician and pathologist communicate freely—\\nformally as well as informally, through surgical pathology\\nrequest forms, verbally, and at different fora such as tissue\\ncommittees and interdepartmental conferences.10SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesSURGICAL PATHOLOGY PROTOCOL\\nREQUEST FORMS. The first and foremost task of the\\nclinician requesting tissue diagnosis is to send a completed\\nrequest form containing patient’s identification data (ID)\\nmatching with that on accompanying specimen container. Thebody of the request form must contain the entire relevant infor-mation about the case and the disease (history, physical andoperative findings, results of other relevant biochemical/haematological/radiological investigations, and clinical and\\ndifferential diagnosis) and reference to any preceding cytology\\nor biopsy examination done in the pathology services.\\nTISSUE ACCESSION.  The laboratory staff receiving the\\nbiopsy specimen must always match the ID of the patient\\non the request form with that on the specimen container.For routine tissue processing by paraffin-embedding\\ntechnique, the tissue must be put in either appropriate\\nfixative solution (most commonly 10% formol-saline or 10%buffered formalin) or received fresh-unfixed. For frozensection, the tissue is always transported fresh-unfixed.Microwave fixation may also be used in the laboratory forrapid fixation and processing of routine surgical specimens.\\nGROSS ROOM.  Gross examination of the specimen received\\nin the laboratory is the next most important step. Proper gross\\ntissue cutting, gross description and selection of representativetissue sample in larger specimens is a crucial part of thepathologic examination of tissue submitted. Complacency atthis step cannot be remedied at a later stage and might\\nrequire taking the tissue pieces afresh if the specimen is large\\nenough and that may delay the report, or if the biopsy is smalland lost in processing the entire surgical procedure forbiopsy may have to be done again. Modern compact grossingstations have inbuilt system for recording gross description\\nthrough dictaphone without the aid of an assistant to write\\nit. Some laboratories have a protocol of doing gross specimen\\nphotography and specimen radiography, before and aftertissue cutting for documentation.\\nCalcified tissues and bone are subjected to decalcification\\nto remove the mineral and soften the tissue by treatment withdecalcifying agents such as acids and chelating agents (most\\noften aqueous nitric acid).\\nIt is mandatory that all the gross-room personnel follow\\nstrict precautions in handling the tissues infected with\\ntuberculosis, hepatitis, HIV and other viruses.\\nHISTOPATHOLOGY LABORATORY.  Tissue cassettes\\nalong with unique number given in the gross room to the\\ntissue sample is carried throughout laboratory procedures.\\nMajority of histopathology departments use automated tissueprocessors (Fig. 2.1)  having 12 separate stages completing the\\ncycle in about 18 hours by overnight schedule as under:\\n10% formalin for fixation;\\nascending grades of alcohol (70%, 95% through 100%) for\\ndehydration for about 5 hours in 6-7 jars,\\nxylene/toluene/chloroform for clearing for 3 hours in two\\njars; and\\nparaffin impregnation for 6 hours in two thermostat-fitted\\nwaxbaths.In order to avoid contamination of the laboratory with\\nvapours of formalin and alcohols, vacuum tissue processors\\nhaving closed system are also available.\\nEmbedding of tissue is done in molten wax, blocks of\\nwhich are prepared using metallic L (Leuckhart’s) moulds.Nowadays, plastic moulds in different colours for blockingdifferent biopsies are also available. The entire process ofembedding of tissues and blocking can be temperature-controlled for which tissue embedding centres are available(Fig. 2.2) . The blocks are then trimmed followed by sectioning\\nby microtomy, most often by rotary microtome, employingeither fixed knife or disposable blades (Fig. 2.3) .\\nCryostat or frozen section eliminates all the steps of tissue\\nprocessing and paraffin-embedding. Instead, the tissue isquickly frozen to ice at about –25°C which acts as embed-ding medium and then sectioned (Fig. 2.4) . Sections are then\\nready for staining. Frozen section is a rapid intraoperativediagnostic procedure for tissues before proceeding to a majorFigure 2.1 Automatic tissue processor for processing by paraffin-\\nembedding technique.\\n(Thermo Shandon, UK).

Ltd., NewDelhi.\\n11CHAPTER 2 Techniques for the Study of Pathology\\nradical surgery. Besides, it is also used for demonstration of\\ncertain constituents which are normally lost in processingin alcohol or xylene e.g. fat, enzymes etc. This procedurecan be carried out in operation theatre complex near theoperating table.\\nParaffin-embedded sections are routinely stained with\\nhaematoxylin and eosin (H & E). Frozen section is stained\\nwith rapid H & E or toluidine blue routinely. Special stains\\ncan be employed for either of the two methods according to\\nneed. The sections are mounted and submitted for microscopicstudy.\\nSURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT.  The final and the most\\nimportant task of pathology laboratory is issuance of a\\nprompt, accurate, brief, and prognostically significant report.\\nThe ideal report must contain five aspects:\\ni) History (as available to the pathologist including patient’s\\nidentity).ii) Precise gross description.iii)Brief microscopic findings.\\niv)\\nMorphologic diagnosis which must include the organ for\\nindexing purposes using SNOMED ( Scientific Nomenclature\\nin Medicine) codes.\\nv) Additional comments in some cases.\\nQUALITY CONTROL.  Monitoring the quality of output from\\nhistopathology laboratory is important for detecting\\ninadequacies, updating procedures and for improving the\\nfinal report. An internal quality control by mutual discussion\\nin controversial cases and self-check on the quality of sectionscan be carried out informally in the set up. Presently, externalquality control programme for the entire histopathologylaboratory is also available.\\nHISTOPATHOLOGIST AND THE LAW. Currently,\\nproblem of allegations of negligence and malpractice in\\nhistopathology have started coming just as with other clinicaldisciplines. In equivocal biopsies and controversial cases, itis desirable to have internal and external consultations.Besides, the duties of sensitive reporting work should neverbe delegated unless the superior is confident that the delegatee\\nhas sufficient experience and ability.\\nSPECIAL STAINS (HISTOCHEMISTRY)\\nIn H & E staining, haematoxylin stains nuclei and eosin isused as counterstain for cytoplasm and various extracellularmaterial. H & E staining is routinely used to diagnosemicroscopically vast majority of surgical specimens.However, in certain ‘special’ circumstances when thepathologist wants to demonstrate certain specific substancesor constituents of the cells to confirm etiologic, histogenicor pathogenetic components, special stains (also termedhistochemical stains), are employed. The staining dependsupon either physical or chemical or differential solubility ofthe stain with the tissues. The principles of some of thestaining procedures are well known while those of othersare unknown.\\nSome of the substances for which special stains are\\ncommonly used in a surgical pathology laboratory areamyloid, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids,connective tissue, microorganisms, neural tissues, pigments,minerals; these stains are listed in Table 2.1.Figure 2.3 Rotary microtome for section cutting by paraffin-\\nembedding technique.\\n(Thermo Shandon, UK).

Currently, enzyme histochemistry has limiteddiagnostic applications and not so popular, partly due to\\nrequirement of fresh tissues and complex technique, and\\npartly due to relative lack of specificity of reaction in manycases, and hence have been largely superseded by immuno-histochemical procedures and molecular pathology\\ntechniques.\\nPresently, some of common applications of enzyme\\nhistochemistry in diagnostic pathology are in demonstration\\nof muscle related enzymes (ATPase) in myopathies,\\nacetylcholinesterase in diagnosis of Hirschsprung’s disease,\\ncholoroacetate esterase for identification of myeloid cells andmast cells, DOPA reaction for tyrosinase activity inmelanocytes, endogenous dehydrogenase (requiring\\nnitroblue tetrazolium or NBT) for viability of cardiac muscle,\\nand acid and alkaline phosphatases.\\nBASIC MICROSCOPY\\nMicroscope is the basic tool of the pathologist just as is the\\nstethoscope for the physician and speculum for gynaecologist.It is an instrument which produces greatly enlarged imagesof minute objects.LIGHT MICROSCOPY. The usual type of microscope usedin clinical laboratories is called light microscope.  In general,\\nthere are two types of light microscopes:\\nSimple microscope. \\xa0This is a simple hand magnifying lens.\\nThe magnification power of hand lens is from 2x to 200x.\\nCompound microscope. This has a battery of lenses which\\nare fitted in a complex instrument. One type of lens remains\\nnear the object (objective lens) and another type of lens nearthe observer’s eye (eye piece lens). The eyepiece and objectivelenses have different magnification. The compoundmicroscope can be monocular having single eyepiece or\\nbinocular which has two eyepieces (Fig.  2.5) . Multi-headed\\nmicroscopes are used as an aid to teaching and for\\ndemonstration purposes.\\nVARIANTS OF LIGHT MICROSCOPY.  Besides the light\\nmicroscopes, other modifications for special purposes in the\\nclinical laboratories are as under:\\nDark ground illumination (DGI). This method is used for\\nexamination of unstained living microorganisms e.g.Treponema pallidum. The microorganisms are illuminated by\\nan oblique ray of light which does not pass through themicroorganism. The condenser is blackened in the centre andlight passes through its periphery illuminating the livingmicroorganism on a glass slide.\\nPolarising microscope. This method is used for demonstration\\nof birefringence e.g. amyloid, foreign body, hair etc. The light\\nis made plane polarised. After passing through a disc, the14SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nrays of light vibrate in a single plane at right angle to each\\nother. Two discs made up of prism are placed in the path oflight, one below the object known as polariser and another\\nplaced in the body tube which is known as analyser . The lower\\ndisc is rotated to make the light plane polarised. .\\nIMMUNOFLUORESCENCE\\nImmunofluorescence technique is employed to localiseantigenic molecules on the cells by microscopic examination.This is done by using specific antibody against the antigenicmolecule forming antigen-antibody complex at the specificantigenic site which is made visible by employing afluorochrome which has the property to absorb radiation inthe form of ultraviolet light so as to be within the visiblespectrum of light in microscopic examination.\\nThe immunofluorescent method has the following\\nessential components:\\nFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPE.  Fluorescence microscopy\\nis based on the principle that the exciting radiation from\\nultraviolet light of shorter wavelength (360 nm) or blue light(wavelength 400 nm) causes fluorescence of certain substancesand thereafter re-emits light of a longer wavelength.\\nSome substances fluoresce naturally; this is termed\\nprimary fluorescence  or autofluorescence though UV light is\\nrequired for visualising them better e.g. vitamin A, porphyrin,chlorophyll.\\nSecondary fluorescence is more commonly employed and\\nis the production of fluorescence on addition of dyes or chemi-cals called fluorochromes.\\nSource of light. Mercury vapour and xenon gas lamps are\\nused as source of light for fluorescence microscopy.Filters.  A variety of filters are used between the source of\\nlight and objective: first,  heat absorbing filter; second,  red-light\\nstop filter; and third  exciter filter to allow the passage of light\\nof only the desired wavelength. On passing through thespecimen, light of both exciting and fluorescence wavelengthcollects. Exciter light is removed by another filter called barrier\\nfilter between the objective and the observer to protect the\\nobserver’s eyes so that only fluorescent light reaches the eyesof observer.\\nCondenser.  Dark-ground condenser is used in fluorescence\\nmicroscope so that no direct light falls into the object and\\ninstead gives dark contrast background to the fluorescence.\\nTECHNIQUES. There are two types of fluorescence\\ntechniques both of which are performed on cryostat sections\\nof fresh unfixed tissue: direct and indirect.\\nIn the direct technique,  first introduced by Coons (1941)\\nwho did the original work on immunofluorescence, antibodyagainst antigen is directly conjugated with the fluorochromeand then examined under fluorescence microscope.\\nIn the indirect technique,  also called sandwich technique,\\nthere is interaction between tissue antigen and specific anti-body, followed by a step of washing and then addition offluorochrome for completion of reaction. Indirectimmunofluorescence technique is applied to detect auto-antibodies in patient’s serum.\\nAPPLICATIONS. Immunofluorescence methods are applied\\nfor the following purposes:\\n1.Detection of autoantibodies in the serum  e.g. smooth muscle\\nantibodies (SMA), antinuclear antibodies (ANA),\\nantimitochondrial antibody (AMA), thyroid microsomalantibody etc.\\n2.In renal diseases  for detection of deposits of immuno-\\nglobulins, complement and fibrin in various types of\\nglomerular diseases by frozen section as discussed inChapter 22.\\n3.In skin diseases  to detect deposits of immunoglobulin by\\nfrozen section, particularly at the dermo-epidermal junction\\nand in upper dermis e.g. in various bullous dermatosis(Chapter 26).\\n4. For study of mononuclear cell surface markers using mono-\\nclonal antibodies.\\n5\\n. For specific diagnosis of infective disorders  e.g. viral\\nhepatitis.\\nELECTRON MICROSCOPY\\nElectron microscope (EM) first developed in 1930s in Germany\\nhas undergone modifications so as to add extensive newknowledge to our understanding the structure and functionof normal and diseased cells at the level of cell organelles.However, more recently, widespread use of diagnosticimmunohistochemistry in surgical pathology has restrictedthe application of EM to the following areas of diagnosticpathology:1. In renal pathology in conjunction with light microscopy\\nand immunofluorescence (Chapter 22).Figure 2.5 Binocular light microscope (Model E 400, Nikon, Japan).\\nCourtesy: Towa Optics (India) Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi.\\n15CHAPTER 2 Techniques for the Study of Pathology2. Ultrastructure of tumours of uncertain histogenesis.\\n3. Subcellular study of macrophages in storage diseases.4. For research purposes.\\nTYPES OF EM\\nThere are two main types of EM:1. Transmission electron microscope (TEM). TEM is the tool\\nof choice for pathologist for study of ultrastructure of cell at\\norganelle level. In TEM, a beam of electrons passes throughultrathin section of tissue. The magnification obtained by TEMis 2,000 to 10,000 times.\\n2. Scanning electron microscope (SEM).  SEM scans the cell\\nsurface architecture and provides three-dimensional image.\\nFor example, for viewing the podocytes in renal glomerulus.\\nTechnical Aspects\\nFollowing are some of the salient technical considerations\\npertaining to EM:\\n1. Fixation.  Whenever it is planned to undertake EM\\nexamination of tissue, small thin piece of tissue not more than\\n1 mm thick should be fixed in 2-4% buffered glutaraldehydeor in mixture of formalin and glutaraldehyde. Followingfixation, the tissue is post-fixed in buffered solution of osmiumtetroxide to enhance the contrast.\\n2. Embedding.  Tissue is plastic-embedded with resin on\\ngrid.3. Semithin sections.  First, semithin sections are cut at a\\nthickness of 1 μm and stained with methylene blue or\\ntoluidine blue. Sometimes, paraffin blocks can also be cut for\\nEM study but generally are not quite satisfactory due tonumerous artefacts. Semithin sections guide in making thedifferential diagnosis and in selecting the area to be viewedin ultrathin sections.\\n4. Ultrathin sections.  For ultrastructural examination,\\nultrathin sections are cut by use of diamond knife. In order to\\nincrease electron density, thin sections may be stained byimmersing the grid in solution of lead citrate and urinylacetate.\\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY\\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) is the application of immuno-logic techniques to the cellular pathology. The technique isused to detect the status and localisation of particular antigenin the cells (membrane, cytoplasm or nucleus) by use ofspecific antibodies which are then visualised by chromogenas brown colour. This then helps in determining cell lineagespecifically, or is used to confirm a specific infection. IHC hasrevolutionised diagnostic pathology (“brown revolution”) and\\nin many sophisticated laboratories IHC has replacedhistochemistry as an ancillary technique. Besides the differentprinciples underlying immunohistochemistry andhistochemistry, these two techniques differ in the end-result:while histochemistry produces variety of colours for differentconstituents stained depending upon the substance stained,immunohistochemistry characteristically produces browncolour only at the appropriate place in the cell as the end-result for interpretation.\\nIn the last decade, significant advances have been made\\nin techniques for IHC. Now, it is possible to use routinelyprocessed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks for IHC, thusmaking profound impact on diagnostic surgical pathology.Earlier, diagnostic surgical pathology used to be considereda subjective science with inter-observer variation, particularlyin borderline lesions and lesions of undetermined origin, butuse of IHC has added objectivity, specificity  and reproducibility\\nto the surgical pathologist’s diagnosis.\\nOverview of IHC\\nEvolution of IHC can be traced to immunofluorescence\\nmethods  in which antibodies labelled with fluorescent\\ncompound could localise the specific antigen in the cryostat\\nsection.\\nNeed for fluorescent microscope was obviated by\\nsubsequent development of horseradish peroxidase enzymatic\\nlabelling technique  with some colorogenic system instead of\\nfluorochrome so that the frozen section with labelled antibodycould be visualised by light microscopy. Chromogens\\ncommonly used in immunohistochemical reaction arediaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and aminoethylcarbazole (AEC), both of which produce stable dark brown\\nreaction end-product.\\nSubsequently, immunoperoxidase technique employing\\nlabelled antibody method to formalin-fixed paraffin sections  was\\ndeveloped which is now widely used.\\nCurrently, the two most commonly used procedures in\\nIHC are as under:i)Peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method  in which PAP\\nreagent is pre-formed stable immune-complex which is linkedto the primary antibody by a bridging antibody.ii)Avidin-biotin conjugate (ABC) immunoenzymatic technique\\nin which biotinylated secondary antibody serves to link theprimary antibody to a large preformed complex of avidin,\\nbiotin and peroxidase.\\nSelection of antibody/antibodies for performing IHC\\nstaining is done after making differential diagnosis on H & E\\nsections. Generally, a panel of antibodies is preferable over a\\nsingle test to avoid errors.\\nAntibodies for IHC are produced by polyclonal and\\nmonoclonal (hybridoma) techniques;  the latter is largely used to\\nproduce specific high-affinity antibodies. At present, vastnumber of antibodies against cell antigens for IHC stains are\\navailable and the list is increasing at a steady rate.\\nIHC stains should always be done with appropriate\\npositive controls  i.e. tissue which is known to express particular\\nantigen acts as a control, which may be either internal control\\nor separate tissue. ‘Sausage’ tissue block technique combines\\nthe staining of multiple tissues in a single slide with a single\\nstaining procedure and is quite economical.\\nFor interpretation of results of IHC stains, it is important\\nto remember that different antigens are localised at different sites\\nin cells  (membrane, cytoplasm or nucleus) and accordingly\\npositive staining is seen and interpreted at those sites e.g.16SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesmembranous staining for leucocyte common antigen (LCA),\\nnuclear staining for oestrogen-progesterone receptors (ER-PR), cytoplasmic staining for smooth muscle actin (SMA) etc.\\nIHC stains cannot be applied to distinguish between\\nneoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions, or between benign andmalignant tumours. These distinctions have to be done bytraditional methods in surgical pathology.\\nMajor Applications of IHC\\nAt present, IHC stains are used for the following purposes,\\nin order of diagnostic utility:\\n1. Tumours of uncertain histogenesis. IHC has brought\\nabout a revolution in approach to diagnosis of tumours of\\nuncertain origin, primary as well as metastatic from anunknown primary tumour. A panel of antibodies is chosento resolve such diagnostic problem cases; the selection ofantibodies being made is based on clinical history,morphologic features, and results of other relevantinvestigations. Towards this, IHC stains for intermediatefilaments  (keratin, vimentin, desmin, neurofilaments, and glial\\nfibillary acidic proteins) expressed by the tumour cells are ofimmense value besides others listed in Table 2.2.\\n2. Prognostic markers in cancer.  The second important\\napplication of IHC is to predict the prognosis of tumours bydetection of micrometastasis, occult metastasis, and byidentification of certain features acquired, or productselaborated, or genes overexpressed, by the malignant cells topredict the biologic behaviour of the tumour. These include:proto-oncogenes (e.g. HER-2/neu overexpression incarcinoma breast), tumour suppressor genes or antioncogenes(e.g. Rb gene, p53), growth factor receptors (e.g. epidermal\\ngrowth factor receptor or EGFR), and tumour cell proliferationmarkers (e.g. Ki67, proliferation cell nuclear antigen PCNA).Analysis of tumours by these methods is a significantimprovement in management over the conventionalprognostic considerations by clinical staging and histologicgrading.\\n3. Prediction of response to therapy. IHC is widely used to\\npredict therapeutic response in two important tumours—\\ncarcinoma of the breast and prostate. Both these tumours areunder the growth regulation of hormones—oestrogen andandrogen, respectively. The specific receptors for these growthregulating hormones are located on respective tumour cells.Tumours expressing high level of receptor positivity wouldrespond favourably to removal of the endogenous source ofsuch hormones (oophorectomy in oestrogen-positive breastcancer and orchiectomy in androgen-positive prostaticcarcinoma), or hormonal therapy is administered to lowertheir levels: oestrogen therapy in prostatic cancer andandrogen therapy in breast cancer. The results of oestrogen-receptors and progesterone-receptors in breast cancer havesignificant prognostic correlation, though the results ofandrogen-receptor studies in prostatic cancer have limitedprognostic value.\\n4. Infections. IHC stains are now being applied to confirm\\ninfectious agent in tissues by use of specific antibodies against\\nmicrobial DNA or RNA e.g. detection of viruses (HBV, CMV,HPV, herpesviruses), bacteria (e.g. Helicobacter pylori), and\\nparasites (Pneumocystis carinii ) etc.\\nCYTOGENETICS\\nApplied aspects of cytogenetics have been discussed inChapter 10. Here, we shall concentrate on brief technicalconsiderations only.\\nHuman somatic cells are diploid and contain 46 chromo-\\nsomes: 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sexchromosomes (XX in the case of female and XY in the males).Gametes (sperm and ova) contain 23 chromosomes and arecalled haploid cells. All ova contain 23X while sperms contain\\neither 23X or 23Y chromosomes. Thus, the sex of the offspringis determined by paternal chromosomal contribution i.e. ifthe ovum is fertilised by X-bearing sperm, female zygoteresults, while an ovum fertilised by Y-bearing sperm formsmale zygote.\\nKaryotyping\\nKaryotype is defined as the sequence of chromosomal align-\\nment on the basis of size, centromeric location and bandingpattern. The structure of chromosome is described inChapter 3.\\nDetermination of karyotype of an individual is an\\nimportant tool in cytogenetic analysis. Broad outlines ofkaryotyping are as under:\\uf075\\uf075TABLE 2.2: Common Immunohistochemical Stains for\\nTumours of Uncertain Origin.\\nTumour Immunostain\\n1.Epithelial tumours i) Pankeratin (fractions: high and\\n(Carcinomas) low molecular weight keratins,HMW-K, LMW-K)\\nii)\\nEpithelial membrane antigen (EMA)\\niii)Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)\\niv) Neuron-specific enolase (NSE)\\n2.Mesenchymal i) Vimentin (general mesenchymal)\\ntumours ii) Desmin (for general myogenic)\\n(Sarcomas) iii) Muscle specific actin\\n(for general myogenic)\\niv) Myoglobin (for skeletal myogenic)\\nv)α-1-anti-chymotrypsin\\n(for malignant fibrous histiocytoma)\\nvi)  Factor VIII (for vascular tumours)\\nvii) CD34 (endothelial marker)\\n3.Special groupsa)  Melanoma i) HMB-45 (most specific)\\nii) Vimentin\\niii) S-100\\nb) Lymphoma i) Leucocyte common antigen\\n(LCA/CD45)\\nii) Pan-B (Immunoglobulins, CD20)\\niii) Pan-T (CD3)\\niv) CD15, CD30 (RS cell marker for\\nHodgkin’s)\\nc) Neural and i) Neurofilaments (NF) neuroendocrine ii) NSE  tumours iii) GFAP (for glial tumours)\\niv) Chromogranin (for neuroendocrine)\\nv) Synaptophysin17CHAPTER 2 Techniques for the Study of Pathology1. Cell selection. Cells capable of growth and division are\\nselected for cytogenetic analysis. These include: cells from\\namniotic fluid, chorionic villus (CVS) sampling, peripheralblood lymphocytes, bone marrow, lymph node, solid tumoursetc.\\n2. Cell culture. The sample so obtained is cultured in mito-\\ngen media. A mitogen  is a substance which induces mitosis in\\nthe cells e.g. PPD, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), pokeweed\\nmitogen (PWM), phorbol ester etc. The dividing cells arethen arrested in metaphase by the addition of colchicine orcolcemid, both of which are inhibitory to microtubuleformation. Subsequently, the cells are lysed by addinghypotonic solution.\\nThe metaphase cells are then fixed in methanol-glacial\\nacetic acid mixture.\\n3. Staining/banding.  When stained, chromosomes have the\\nproperty of forming alternating dark and light bands. For this\\npurpose, fixed metaphase preparation is stained by one ofthe following banding techniques:a)Giemsa banding  or G-banding,  the most commonly used.\\nb)Quinacrine banding  or Q-banding  used to demonstrate\\nbands along chromosomes.c)Constitutive banding  or C-banding is used to demonstrate\\nconstitutive heterochromatin.d)Reverse staining Giemsa banding  (or R-banding ) gives pattern\\nopposite to those obtained by G-banding.\\n4. Microscopic analysis.  Chromosomes are then photo-\\ngraphed by examining the preparation under the microscope.\\nFrom the photograph, chromosomes are cut and then\\narranged according to their size, centromeric location and\\nbanding patterns. The pairs of chromosomes are identified\\nby the arm length of chromosomes. The centromere divides\\nthe chromosome into a short upper arm called p arm (p for\\npetit in French meaning ‘short’) and a long lower arm called q\\narm (letter q next to p).\\nCurrently, molecular cytogenetic analysis and charac-\\nterisation of chromosomes is possible by the revolutionarytechnique of multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization\\n(FISH) ( vide infra  under Molecular Pathology).\\nApplications\\nThe field of cytogenetics has widespread applications in\\ndiagnostic pathology (Chapter 10). In brief, karyotyping is\\nemployed for the following purposes:\\ni)Chromosomal numerical abnormalities  e.g. Down’s syndrome\\n(trisomy 21 involving autosome 21), Klinefelter’s syndrome(trisomy 46), Turner’s syndrome (monosomy 45, XO),spontaneous abortions.\\nii)Chromosome structural abnormalities  include translocations\\n{e.g. Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22), cri-du-chat (5p)syndrome, repeated spontaneous miscarriages}, deletions,insertions, isochromosome, and ring chromosome formation.iii)Cancer  is characterised by multiple and complex chromo-\\nsomal abnormalities which include deletions, amplifications,inversions and translocations, especially in leukaemias andlymphomas, germ cell tumours, some sarcomas.DIAGNOSTIC MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY\\nDuring the last quarter of 20th Century, rapid strides havebeen made in the field of molecular biology. As a result,molecular techniques which were earlier employed forresearch purposes only have now been made available fordiagnostic purposes. These techniques detect abnormalitiesat the level of DNA or RNA of the cell.\\nBroadly speaking, all the DNA/RNA-based molecular\\ntechniques employ hybridization (meaning joining together)technique based on recombinant technology. Specific regionof DNA or RNA is detected by labelling it with a probe (Probe\\nis a chain of nucleotides consisting of certain number of knownbase pairs). Probes are of different sizes and sources as under:1.Genomic probes  derived from a region of DNA of cells.\\n2.cDNA probe  derived from RNA by reverse transcription.\\n3.Oligonucleotide probe is a synthetic probe contrary togenomic DNA and cDNA probe both of which are deri-ved from cellular material.\\n4.Riboprobe  is prepared by  in vitro  transcription system.\\nMOLECULAR METHODS\\nFollowing is a brief account of various molecular techniques\\navailable as diagnostic tool in surgical pathology:\\n1. IN\\xa0SITU  HYBRIDISATION.  In situ  hybridisation (ISH) is\\na molecular hybridisation technique which allows localisation\\nof nucleic acid sequence directly in the intact cell  (i.e. in situ)\\nwithout DNA extraction unlike other hybridisation-basedmethods described below. ISH involves specific hybridisationof a single strand of a labelled nucleic acid probe to a singlestrand of complementary target DNA or RNA in the tissue.The end-product of hybridisation is visualised by radioactive-labelled probe (\\n32P, 125I), or non-radioactive-labelled probe\\n(e.g. biotin, digoxigenin).\\nApplications.  ISH is used for the following:\\ni) In  viral infections  e.g. HPV, EBV, HIV, CMV, HCV etc.\\nii) In human tumours  for detection of gene expression and\\noncogenes.\\niii) In chromosomal disorders,  particularly by use of fluorescent\\nin situ  hybridisation (FISH).\\n2. FILTER HYBRIDISATION.  In this method, target DNA\\nor RNA is extracted from the tissue, which may either be fresh,\\nfrozen and unfixed tissue, or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Extracted target DNA or RNA is thenimmobilised on nitrocellulose filter or nylon. Hybridisation\\nof the target DNA is then done with labelled probe. DNA\\nanalysis by filter hybridisation includes various methods asunder:i)Slot and dot blots  in which the DNA sample is directly\\nbound to the filter without fractionation of nucleic acid size.ii)Southern blot  which is similar to dot-blot but differs in\\nperforming prior DNA-size fractionation by gel electro-phoresis (E.M. Southern is the name of scientist who describedSouthern blot technique).iii)Northern blot  is similar to Southern blot but involves size\\nfractionation of RNA (Northern is, however, opposite\\ndirection of southern and not someone’s name).18SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesiv)Western blot  is analogous to the previous two methods but\\nis employed for protein fractionation; in this method\\nantibodies are used as probes.\\nApplications.  In view of high degree of specificity and\\nsensitivity of the molecular hybridisation techniques, these\\ntechniques have widespread applications in diagnosticpathology:i)In neoplasia,  haematologic as well as non-haematologic.\\nii)In infectious diseases  for actual diagnosis of causative agent,\\nepidemiologic studies and identification of newer infectiousagents.iii)In inherited genetic diseases  for carrier testing, prenatal diag-\\nnosis and direct diagnosis of the genetic disease.iv)In identity determination  for tissue transplantation, forensic\\npathology, and parentage testing.\\n3. POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION.  Polymerase chain\\nreaction (PCR) is a revolutionary technique for molecular\\ngenetic purpose with widespread applications in diagnosticsand research. The technique is based on the principle that a\\nsingle strand of DNA has limitless capacity to duplicate itselfto form millions of copies. In PCR, a single strand of DNAgenerates another by DNA polymerase using a shortcomplementary DNA fragment; this is done using a primerwhich acts as an initiating template.\\nA cycle of PCR consists of three steps:\\ni)Heat denaturation  of DNA (at 94°C for 60-90 seconds).\\nii)Annealing  of the primers to their complementary\\nsequences (at 55°C for 30-120 seconds).iii)Extension  of the annealed primers with DNA polymerase\\n(at 72°C for 60-180 seconds).\\nRepeated cycling can be done in automated thermal cycler\\nand yields large accumulation of the target sequence sinceeach newly generated product, in turn, acts as template inthe next cycle.\\nApplications.  PCR analysis has the same applications as for\\nfilter hybridisation techniques and has many advantages over\\nthem in being more rapid, can be automated by thermalcyclers and requires much lower amount of starting DNA.However, PCR suffers from the risk of contamination; thusextreme caution is required in the laboratory during PCRtechnique.\\nOTHER MODERN AIDS IN\\nDIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY\\nFLOW CYTOMETRY\\nFlow cytometry is a modern tool used for the study of pro-\\nperties of cells suspended in a single moving stream. Flowcytometry, thus, overcomes the problem of subjectivityinvolved in microscopic examination of cells and tissues inhistopathology and cytopathology.\\nFlow cytometer  has a laser-light source for fluorescence,\\ncell transportation system in a single stream, monochromaticfilters, lenses, mirrors and a computer for data analysis. Flowcytometer acts like a cell sorter to physically sort out cellsfrom liquid suspension flowing in a single-file. Since single-cell suspensions are required for flow cytometry, itsapplications are limited to flow assays e.g. leucocytes,erythrocytes and their precursors; body fluids, and sometimessolid tissues homgenised to make into cell suspensions.\\nApplications.  Flow cytometric analysis finds uses in clinical\\npractice in the following ways:\\n1.Immunophenotyping  by detailed antigenic analysis of\\nvarious haematopoietic neoplasias e.g. acute and chronic\\nleukaemias, lymphomas (Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s), andplasmacytic neoplasms.\\n2.Measurement of proliferation-associated antigens  e.g. Ki67,\\nPCNA.3.Measurement of nucleic acid content  e.g. measuring RNA\\ncontent of reticulocytes, quantifying DNA content and DNA\\nploidy counts in various types of cancers.\\n4.Diagnosis and prognostication of immunodeficiency  e.g. in\\nAIDS by CD4 + T lymphocyte counts. Patients with CD4 + T\\ncell counts below 500/ml require antiviral treatment.\\n5.\\nTo diagnose the cause of allograft rejection  in renal trans-\\nplantation in end-stage renal disease by CD3 + T cell counts.\\nPatients with CD3 + T cells below 100-200/ml have lowerrisk of graft rejection.\\n6.Diagnosis of autoantibodies  in ITP, autoimmune neutro-\\npenia.\\nMETHODS FOR CELL PROLIFERATION ANALYSIS\\nBesides flow cytometry, the degree of proliferation of cells in\\ntumours can be determined by various other methods. Theseinclude the following:\\n1. Mitotic count.  This is the oldest but still widely used\\nmethod in routine diagnostic pathology work. The number\\nof cells in mitosis are counted per high power field e.g. incategorising various types of smooth muscle tumours.\\n2. Radioautography.  In this method, the proliferating cells\\nare labelled in vitro  with thymidine and then the tissue\\nprocessed for paraffin-embedding. Thymidine-labelled cells\\n(corresponding to S-phase) are then counted per 2000 tumourcell nuclei and expressed as thymidine-labelling index. Themethod is employed as prognostic marker in breastcarcinoma.\\n3. Microspectrophotometric analysis.  The section is stained\\nwith Feulgen reaction which imparts staining to DNA content\\nof the cell and then DNA content is measured bymicrospectrophotometer. The method is tedious and haslimited use.\\n4. Immunohistochemistry.  The nuclear antigen specific for\\ncell growth and division is stained by immunohistochemical\\nmethod and then positive cells are counted under themicroscope or by an image analyser. Such proliferationmarkers include Ki-67, PCNA, cyclins.\\n5. Nucleolar organiser region (NOR). Nucleolus contains\\nribosomal components which are formed at chromosomal\\nregions containing DNA called NORs. NORs have affinityfor silver. This property is made use in staining the section19CHAPTER 2 Techniques for the Study of Pathologywith silver (AgNOR technique). NORs appear as black\\nintranuclear dots while the background is stained yellow-brown.\\nCOMPUTERS IN  PATHOLOGY LABORATORY\\nA busy pathology laboratory has a lot of data to be\\ncommunicated to the clinicians. Pathologist too requires accessto patient’s data prior to reporting of results on specimensreceived. It is, therefore, imperative that a modern pathologylaboratory has laboratory information system (LIS) whichshould be ideally connected to hospital information system(HIS).\\nBesides, the laboratory staff and doctors should have\\nadequate computer literacy on these systems.\\nThere are two main purposes of having computers in the\\nlaboratory:\\nfor the billing  of patients’ investigations; and\\nfor reporting  of results of tests in numeric, narrative and\\ngraphic format.\\nApplications.  Application of computers in the pathology\\nlaboratory has several advantages as under:\\n1. The laboratory as well as the hospital staff have access toinformation pertaining to the patient which helps in improving\\npatientcare.2. The turn-around time  (i.e. time between specimen collec-\\ntion and reporting of results) of any test is shortened.3. It improves productivity  of laboratory staff at all levels who\\ncan be utilised for other jobs.4.Coding and indexing  of results and data of different tests\\nare possible on computer system.5. For research purposes  and getting accreditation so as to get\\ngrants for research, computerised data of results aremandatory.6.Storage and retrieval of laboratory data to  save time and space\\noccupied by the records.\\nSPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM. Computer systems are\\nnow available which can recognise and transform spokenwords of gross and microscopic description of reports throughdictaphone into text without the use of secretarial staff.\\nIMAGE ANALYSER AND MORPHOMETRY\\nPathology is  very visual subject and hence analysis of\\nmicroscopic images forms the main plank of its study. There\\nhas been need as well as desire to impart more and moreobjectivity to the rather subjective reports of histopatholgogy.Now, with advances in computing techniques, objectivemeasurement of microscopic features quantitatively to impartreproducibility in histopathology has been achieved.\\nImage analyser is a system that is used to perform\\nmeasurement of architectural, cellular and nuclear featuresof cells. Briefly, the image analyser consists of the following:1.Standard light microscope with a video camera mounted\\nit.2\\n. A computer system (CPU, monitor, key board, mouse etc)\\nconnected to the microscope.3. An image capture board to convert displayed video imageon the monitor into digital image and store it in the CPU.4. Image analysis software installed in the computer systemaccording to the requirement of the user for makingmeasurements and calculations.\\nAPPLICATIONS. Image analyser can be used for various\\npurposes as under:1.Morphometric study of tumour cells by measurement of\\narchitectural, cellular and nuclear features.2.Quantitative nuclear DNA ploidy measurement.\\n3. Quantitative valuation of immunohistochemical staining.\\nDNA MICROARRAYS\\nDNA microarray is the newer application of silicon chip\\ntechnology for simultaneous analysis of large volume of datapertaining to human genes such as detection andquantification of point mutation and single nuceotidepleomorphism. The method eliminates use of DNA probes.Instead fluorescent labelling of an array of DNA fragment(complimentary or cDNA) is used to hybridise with targetfrom test sample. High resolution laser scanners are used fordetecting fluorescent signals emitted, while the level of geneexpression and genotyping of the biologic samples ismeasured by application of bioinformatics.\\nAPPLICATIONS. DNA microarrays is used for molecular\\nprofiling of tumours which aids in arriving at specifichistogenetic diagnosis and predicting prognosis.\\nLASER MICRODISSECTION\\nLaser microdissection is another newer technique in\\ndiagnostic surgical pathology for carrying out molecularprofiling on tissue material. It involves dissection of a singlecell or part of the cell (e.g. chromosomes) by sophisticatedlaser technology and employs software for the procedure. Theisolated material can then be used for performing availablemolecular tests.\\nTELEPATHOLOGY AND VIRTUAL MICROSCOPY\\nTelepathology  is defined as the practice of diagnostic pathology\\nby a remote pathologist utilising images of tissue specimens\\ntransmitted over a telecommunications network. The maincomponents of a telepathology system are as under:\\nConventional light microscope.\\nMethod of image capture, commonly a camera mounted\\non light microscope.\\nTelecommunications link between sending and receiving\\nside.\\nWorkstation at receiving end with a high quality\\nmonitor.\\nDepending upon need and budget, telepathology system\\nis of two types :\\nStatic (store-and-forward, passive telepathology):  In this,\\nselected images are captured, stored and then transmittedover the internet via e-mail attachment, file transfer protocol,web page or CD-ROM. It is quite inexpensive and is morecommon but suffers from disadvantage of having sender’sbias in selection of transmitted images.\\nDynamic (Robotic interactive telepathology):  Here, the\\nimages are transmitted in real-time from a remote20SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesmicroscope. Robotic movement of stage of microscope is\\ncontrolled remotely and the desired images and fields areaccessioned from a remote/local server. Thus, it almostduplicates to perfection the examination of actual slidesunder the microscope, hence is referred to as Virtual\\nMicroscopy. However, image quality and speed of internet\\ncan be major hurdles.\\nThe era of “ digital pathology ” in 21st Century has reached\\nits zenith with availability of technology for preparationof virtual pathology slides (VPS)  by high speed scanners and\\nthen storing the scanned data in large memory outputcomputers. VPS stored in the memory of the computer canthen be examined and reported at any place on computer,without having to use microscope. However, the mootquestion remains whether current pathologists used toconventional microscopy will get the same perception onmonitor. At present, this technology holds potential forpathology education, clinical meetings and quality control.\\n❑21CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations\\nChapter 3Cell Injury and\\nCellular AdaptationsChapter 3\\nCells are the basic units of tissues, which form organs and\\nsystems in the human body. Traditionally, body cells aredivided in to two main types: epithelial and mesenchymalcells. In health, the cells remain in accord with each other. In1859, Virchow first published cellular theory of disease,bringing in the concept that diseases occur due toabnormalities at the level of cells. Since then, study ofabnormalities in structure and function of cells in disease hasremained the focus of attention in understanding of diseases.Thus, most forms of diseases begin with cell injury followedby consequent loss of cellular function. Cell injury is defined as\\na variety of stresses a cell encounters as a result of changes in itsinternal and external environment.\\nIn general, cells of the body have inbuilt mechanism to\\ndeal with changes in environment to an extent. The cellularresponse to stress may vary and depends upon the followingvariables:i)The type of cell and tissue involved.\\nii) Extent and type of cell injury.\\nVarious forms of cellular responses to cell injury may be\\nas follows  (Fig.\\xa03.1):\\n1. When there is increased functional demand, the cell may\\nadapt to the changes which are expressed morphologicallyand then revert back to normal after the stress is removed(cellular adaptations, see  Fig. 3.39).\\n2.\\nWhen the stress is mild to moderate, the injured cell may\\nrecover (reversible cell injury) , while when the injury is\\npersistent cell death may occur (irreversible cell injury) .\\n3.The residual effects of reversible cell injury may persist\\nin the cell as evidence of cell injury at subcellular level(subcellular changes) , or metabolites may accumulate within\\nthe cell (intracellular accumulations) .\\nIn order to learn the fundamentals of disease processes\\nat cellular level, it is essential to have an understanding ofthe causes and mechanisms of cell injury and cellularadaptations, which can be best understood in the context ofbasic knowledge of normal structure and functions of celloutlined below.\\nTHE NORMAL CELL\\nDifferent types of cells of the body possess features whichdistinguish one type from another. However, mostmammalian cells have a basic plan of common structure andfunction, except the red blood cell which is devoid of nucleusand its structure is described separately on page 288.\\nCELL STRUCTURE\\nUnder normal conditions, cells are dynamic structures\\nexisting in fluid environment. A cell is enclosed by cellmembrane that extends internally to enclose nucleus andvarious subcellular organelles suspended in cytosol(Fig. 3.2).\\nCell Membrane\\nElectron microscopy has shown that cell membrane or\\nplasma membrane has a trilaminar structure having a totalthickness of about 7.5 nm and is known as unit membrane .\\nThe three layers consist of two electron-dense layersseparated by an electronlucent layer. Biochemically, the cellmembrane is composed of complex mixture of phos-pholipids, glycolipids, cholesterol, proteins and carbo-hydrates. These layers are in a gel-like arrangement and arein a constant state of flux. The outer surface of some types ofcells shows a coat of mucopolysaccharide forming a fuzzylayer called glycocalyx.  Proteins and glycoproteins of the cell\\nmembrane may act as antigens (e.g. blood group antigens),or may form receptors (e.g. for viruses, bacterial products,hormones, immunoglobulins and many enzymes). The cell\\nFigure 3.1 Cellular responses to cell injury.\\n22SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nreceptors are probably related to the microtubules and micro-\\nfilaments of the underlying cytoplasm. The microtubulesconnect one receptor with the next. The microfilaments arecontractile structures so that the receptor may move withinthe cell membrane. Bundle of microfilaments along withcytoplasm and protein of cell membrane may formprojections on the surface of the cell called microvilli .\\nMicrovilli are especially numerous on the surface ofabsorptive and secretory cells (e.g. small intestinal mucosa)increasing their surface area.\\nIn brief, the cell membrane performs the following\\nimportant functions:\\ni) Selective permeability that includes diffusion, membrane\\npump (sodium pump) and pinocytosis (cell drinking).\\nii) Bears membrane antigens (e.g. blood group antigens,\\ntransplantation antigen).\\niii)Possesses cell receptors for cell-cell recognition and\\ncommunication.Nucleus\\nThe nucleus consists of an outer nuclear membrane enclosing\\nnuclear chromatin and nucleoli.\\nNUCLEAR MEMBRANE.  The nuclear membrane is the\\nouter envelop consisting of 2 layers of the unit membrane\\nwhich are separated by a 40-70 nm wide space. The outerlayer of the nuclear membrane is studded with ribosomesand is continuous with endoplasmic reticulum. The twolayers of nuclear membrane at places are fused togetherforming circular nuclear pores which are about 50 nm indiameter. The nuclear membrane is crossed by  several factorwhich regulate the gene expression and repair the DNAdamage as soon as it occurs.\\nNUCLEAR\\xa0 CHROMATIN.  The main substance of the\\nnucleus is comprised by the nuclear chromatin which is in\\nthe form of shorter pieces of thread-like structures calledchromosomes  of which there are 23 pairs (46 chromosomes)Figure 3.2 Schematic diagram of the structure of an epithelial cell.\\n23CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptationstogether measuring about a metre in length in a human\\ndiploid cell. Of these, there are 22 pairs (44 chromosomes) ofautosomes  and one pair of sex chromosomes , either XX (female)\\nor XY (male). Each chromosome is composed of twochromatids connected at the centromere to form ‘X’configuration having variation in location of the centromere.Depending upon the length of chromosomes and centromericlocation, 46 chromosomes are categorised into 7 groups fromA to G according to Denver classification  (adopted at a meeting\\nin Denver, USA).\\nChromosomes are composed of 3 components, each with\\ndistinctive function. These are: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)comprising about 20%, ribonucleic acid (RNA) about 10%,and the remaining 70% consists of nuclear proteins thatinclude a number of basic proteins (histones), neutralproteins, and acid proteins. DNA of the cell is largelycontained in the nucleus. The only other place in the cell thatcontains small amount of DNA is mitochondria. NuclearDNA along with histone nuclear proteins form bead-likestructures called nucleosomes which are studded along thecoils of DNA. Nuclear DNA carries the genetic informationthat is passed via RNA into the cytoplasm for manufactureof proteins of similar composition. During cell division, onehalf of DNA molecule acts as a template for the manufactureof the other half by the enzyme, DNA polymerase, so thatthe genetic characteristics are transmitted to the next progenyof cells (replication) .\\nThe DNA\\xa0molecule  as proposed by Watson and Crick in\\n1953 consists of two complementary polypeptide chains\\nforming a double helical strand which is wound spirally\\naround an axis composed of pentose sugar-phosphoric acidchains. The molecule is spirally twisted in a ladder-likepattern, the steps of which are composed of 4 nucleotide bases:\\ntwo purines  (adenine and guanine, i.e. A and G) and two\\npyrimidines  (cytosine and thymine, i.e. C and T); however, A\\npairs specifically with T while G pairs with C (Fig.\\xa03.3) . The\\nsequence of these nucleotide base pairs in the chain,determines the information contained in the DNA moleculeor constitutes the genetic code. In April 2003, sequencing of\\nhuman genome  was completed which revealed that 23 pairs\\nof chromosomes in the nucleus of each human cell containsapproximately 3 billion base pairs, and each chromosomecontains an estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome,which carry the instructions for making proteins.\\nIn the interphase nucleus (i.e. between mitosis), part of\\nthe chromatin that remains relatively inert metabolically andappears deeply basophilic due to condensation ofchromosomes is called heterochromatin,  while the part of\\nchromatin that is lightly stained (i.e. vesicular) due todispersed chromatin is called euchromatin . For example, in\\nlymphocytes there is predominance of heterochromatin whilethe nucleus of a hepatocyte is mostly euchromatin.\\nNUCLEOLUS.  The nucleus may contain one or more\\nrounded bodies called nucleoli. Nucleolus is the site of\\nsynthesis of ribosomal RNA. Nucleolus is composed ofgranules and fibrils representing newly synthesisedribosomal RNA.Cytosol and Organelles\\nThe cytosol or the cytoplasm is the gel-like ground substance\\nin which the organelles (meaning little organs ) of the cells are\\nsuspended. These organelles are the site of major enzymaticactivities of the cell which are possibly mediated by enzymesin the cytosol. The major organelles are the cytoskeleton,mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgiapparatus, lysosomes, and microbodies or peroxisomes.\\n1. CYTOSKELETON.  Microfilaments, intermediate\\nfilaments, and microtubules are responsible for maintaining\\ncellular form and movement and are collectively referred toas cytoskeleton.\\ni) Microfilaments  are long filamentous structures having\\na diameter of 6-8 nm. They are composed of contractile\\nproteins, actin and myosin, and diverse materials like partsof microtubules and ribonucleoprotein fibres. Bundles ofmicrofilaments are especially prominent close to the plasmamembrane and form terminal web . Extension of these bundles\\nof microfilaments along with part of plasma membrane onthe surface of the cell form microvilli  which increase the\\nabsorptive surface of the cells.\\nii)Intermediate\\n filaments  are filamentous structures, 10 nm\\nin diameter, and are cytoplasmic constituent of a number of\\ncell types. They are composed of proteins. There are5 principal types of intermediate filaments:a)Cytokeratin  (found in epithelial cells).\\nb)Desmin  (found in skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle).Figure 3.3 Diagrammatic structure of portion of helical structure of\\nDNA molecule.\\n24SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesc)Vimentin  (found in cells of mesenchymal origin).\\nd)Glial fibrillary acidic protein  (present in astrocytes and\\nependymal cells).\\ne)Neurofilaments  (seen in neurons of central and peripheral\\nnervous system).\\nTheir main function is to mechanically integrate the cell\\norganelles within the cytoplasm.\\niii)Microtubules  are long hollow tubular structures about\\n25 nm in diameter. They are composed of protein, tubulin.\\nCilia  and flagella  which project from the surface of cell are\\ncomposed of microtubules enclosed by plasma membraneand are active in locomotion of the cells. Basal bodies  present\\nat the base of each cilium or flagellum and centriole  located\\nat the mitotic spindle of cells are the two other morpho-logically similar structures composed of microtubules.\\n2. MITOCHONDRIA. \\uf020Mitochondria are oval structures\\nand are more numerous in metabolically active cells. They\\nare enveloped by two layers of membrane—the outer smoothand the inner folded into incomplete septa or sheaf-like ridgescalled cristae . Chemically and structurally, membranes of\\nmitochondria are similar to cell membrane. The innermembrane, in addition, contains lollipop-shaped globularstructures projecting into the matrix present between thelayers of membrane. The matrix of the mitochondria containsenzymes required in the Krebs’ cycle by which the productsof carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism are oxidised toproduce energy which is stored in the form of ATP in thelollipop-like globular structures. Mitochondria are not staticstructures but undergo changes in their configuration duringenergised state by alteration in the matrix and intercristalspace; the outer membrane is, however, less elastic.\\nMitochondria perform the important metabolic function\\nof oxidative phosphorylation, and in the process generatefree radicals injurious to membranes. They also have role inapoptosis. Mitochondria contain 37 genes out of which13 encode for synthesising proteins. In addition,mitochondria also have some DNA and ribosomes.\\n3.RIBOSOMES.  Ribosomes are spherical particles which\\ncontain 80-85% of the cell’s RNA. They may be present in\\nthe cytosol as ‘free’ unattached form, or in ‘bound’ form whenthey are attached to membrane of endoplasmic reticulum.They may lie as ‘monomeric units’ or as ‘polyribosomes’when many monomeric ribosomes are attached to a linearmolecule of messenger RNA.\\nRibosomes synthesise proteins by translation of\\nmessenger RNA into peptide sequences followed bypackaging of proteins for the endoplasmic reticulum.\\n4. ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM.  Endoplasmic reticulum\\nis composed of vesicles and intercommunicating canals. It is\\ncomposed of unit membrane which is continuous with bothnuclear membrane and the Golgi apparatus, and possiblywith the cell membrane. The main function of endoplasmicreticulum is the manufacture of protein. Morphologically,there are 2 forms of endoplasmic reticulum: rough (orgranular) and smooth (or agranular).i)Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)  is so-called because\\nits outer surface is rough or granular due to attachedribosomes on it. RER is especially well-developed in cellsactive in protein synthesis e.g. Russell bodies of plasma cells,Nissl granules of nerve cells.ii)Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)  is devoid of ribosomes\\non its surface. SER and RER are generally continuous witheach other. SER contains many enzymes which metabolisedrugs, steroids, cholesterol, and carbohydrates and partakein muscle contraction.\\n5.\\nGOLGI APPARATUS.  The Golgi apparatus or Golgi\\ncomplex is generally located close to the nucleus. Morpho-\\nlogically, it appears as vesicles, sacs or lamellae composedof unit membrane and is continuous with the endoplasmicreticulum. The Golgi apparatus is particularly well-developed in exocrine glandular cells.\\nIts main functions are synthesis of carbohydrates and\\ncomplex proteins and packaging of proteins synthesised inthe RER into vesicles. Some of these vesicles may containlysosomal enzymes and specific granules such as inneutrophils and in beta cells of the pancreatic islets.\\n6. LYSOSOMES.  Lysosomes are rounded to oval\\nmembrane-bound organelles containing powerful lysosomal\\ndigestive (hydrolytic) enzymes. There are 3 forms oflysosomes:i)Primary lysosomes or storage vacuoles  are formed from the\\nvarious hydrolytic enzymes synthesised by the RER andpackaged in the Golgi apparatus.ii)Secondary lysosomes or autophagic vacuoles  are formed by\\nfusion of primary lysosomes with the parts of damaged orworn-out cell components.iii)Residual bodies  are indigestible materials in the lysosomes,\\ne.g. lipofuscin.\\n7. CENTRIOLE OR CENTROSOME.  Each cell contains a\\npair of centrioles in the cytoplasm close to nucleus in the\\narea called centrosome. Centrioles are cylindrical structurecomposed of electron-dense evenly-shaped microtubules.\\nThey perform the function of formation of cilia and\\nflagellae and constitute the mitotic spindle of fibrillaryprotein during mitosis.\\nINTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION\\nAll cells in the body constantly exchange information with\\neach other to perform their functions properly. This processis accomplished in the cells by direct cell-to-cell contact\\n(intercellular junctions ), and by chemical agents, also called\\nas molecular agents or factors ( molecular interactions between\\ncells) as under.\\nIntercellular Junctions\\nPlasma membranes of epithelial and endothelial cells, though\\nclosely apposed physically, are separated from each otherby 20 nm wide space. These cells communicate across thisspace through intercellular junctions or junctional complexesvisible under electron microscope and are of 4 types(Fig.\\xa03.4):\\n1. Occluding\\xa0junctions\\xa0(Zonula\\xa0occludens).\\n These are tight\\njunctions situated just below the luminal margin of adjacent25CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations\\ncells. As a result, the regions of occluding zones are\\nimpermeable to macromolecules. The examples of occludingzones are seen in renal tubular epithelial cells, intestinalepithelium, and vascular endothelium in the brainconstituting blood-brain barrier.\\n2. Adhering junctions (Zonula adherens).  These are located\\njust below the occluding zones between the adjacent cells\\nand are permeable to tracer particles. These zones are incontact with actin microfilaments e.g. in small cell carcinomaof the lung.\\n3. Desmosomes (Macula densa).  These are tiny adhesion\\nplates present focally between the adjacent epithelial cells,\\nespecially numerous in the epidermis. Bundles ofintermediate filaments (termed tonofilaments in the case ofepidermis) project from the intercellular desmosomes andradiate into the cytoplasm. Hemidesmosomes are a variantof desmosomes, occurring at the basal region of epithelialcells between plasma membrane and the basementmembrane.\\n4. Gap junctions (Nexus).  Gap junctions or nexus are the\\nregions on the lateral surfaces of epithelial cells where the\\ngap between the adjoining plasma membranes is reducedfrom 20 nm to about 2 nm in width. Pits or holes are presentin the regions of gap junctions so that these regions arepermeable to small tracer particles.\\nMolecular Interactions between Cells\\nBesides having intercellular junctions, most cells\\ncommunicate at molecular level as follows:\\n1. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)\\n2.Cytokines\\n3. Membrane receptors\\n1. CELL ADHESION MOLECULES (CAMs).  These are\\nchemicals which mediate the interaction between cells (cell-\\ncell interaction) as well as between cells and extracellularmatrix (cell-ECM interaction). The ECM  is the ground\\nsubstance or matrix of connective tissue which providesenvironment to the cells and consists of 3 components:i) fibrillar structural proteins (collagen, elastin);ii) adhesion proteins (fibronectin, laminin, fibrillin,osteonectin, tenacin); and\\niii)molecules of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans\\n(heparan sulphate, chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate,keratan sulphate, hyaluronic acid).\\nCAMs participate in fertilisation, embryogenesis, tissue\\nrepair, haemostasis, cell death by apoptosis and ininflammation. CAMs may be detected on the surface of cells\\nas well as free in circulation. There are 5 groups of CAMs:\\ni)\\xa0Integrins.  They have alpha (or CD11*) and beta (CD18)\\nsubunits and have a role in cell-ECM interactions and in\\nleucocyte-endothelial cell interaction.\\nii)\\xa0\\nCadherins.  These are calcium-dependent adhesion\\nmolecules which bind \\uf020adjacent cells together and prevent\\ninvasion of ECM by cancer cells. Various types of cadherins\\ninclude: E-cadherin (epithelial cell), N-cadherin (nerve cell),\\nM-cadherin (muscle cell), and P-cadherin (placenta).\\niii)\\xa0Selectins. \\uf020Also called as lectins, these CAMs contain\\nlectins or lectin-like protein molecules which bind to\\nglycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface. Their major\\nrole is in movement of leucocytes and platelets and developcontact with endothelial cells. Selectins are of 3 types:\\nP-selectin (from platelets, also called CD62), E-selectin  (from\\nendothelial cells, also named ECAM), and L-selectin (from\\nleucocytes, also called LCAM).\\niv) Immunoglobulin superfamily.  This group consists of a\\nvariety of immunoglobulin molecules present on most cells\\nof the body. These partake in cell-to-cell contact through\\nvarious other CAMs and cytokines. They have a major rolein recognition and binding of immunocompetent cells. This\\ngroup includes ICAM-1,2 (intercellular adhesion molecule,\\nalso called CD54), VCAM (vascular cell adhesion molecule,\\nalso named CD106), NCAM (neural cell adhesion molecule).\\nv)CD44.  The last group of adhesion molecules is a break\\naway from immunoglobulin superfamily. CD44 molecule\\nbinds to\\uf020hyaluronic acid and is expressed on leucocytes. It\\nis involved in leucocyte-endothelial interactions as well\\nas in cell-ECM interactions.\\n2. CYTOKINES.  Another way the cells may communicate\\nwith each other is by release of peptides and other molecules\\nacting as paracrine function. Cytokines are soluble proteinssecreted by haemopoietic and non-haemopoietic cells inresponse to various stimuli. Their main role is in activationof immune system. Presently, about 200 cytokines have beenidentified which are grouped in 6 categories:i)Interferons (IFN)\\ni\\ni) Interleukins (IL)\\niii) Tumour necrosis factor group (TNF, cachectin)iv)\\nTransforming growth factor (TGF)\\nv) Colony stimulating factor (CSF)vi) Growth factors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor PDGF,epidermal growth factor EGF, fibroblast growth factor FGF,Figure 3.4 Diagrammatic representation of the intercellular\\njunctions.\\n*CD number (for Cluster of Differentiation) is the nomenclature given to\\nthe clone of cells which carry these molecules on their cell surface or intheir cytoplasm.\\n26SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesendothelial-derived growth factor EDGF, transforming\\ngrowth factor TGF).\\nMany of these cytokines have further subtypes as alpha,\\nbeta, or are identified by numbers. Cytokines involved inleucocyte-endothelial cell interaction are called chemokines\\nwhile growth factors and other cytokines are namedcrinopectins .\\n3. CELL MEMBRANE RECEPTORS.  Cell receptors are\\nmolecules consisting of proteins, glycoproteins or\\nlipoproteins and may be located on the outer cell membrane,\\ninside the cell, or may be trans-membranous. These receptormolecules are synthesised by the cell itself depending upon\\ntheir requirement, and thus there may be upregulation or\\ndownregulation of number of receptors. There are 3 main\\ntypes of receptors:\\ni)Enzyme-linked receptors.  These receptors are involved\\nin\\uf020control of cell growth e.g. tyrosine kinase associated\\nreceptors take part in activation of synthesis and secretion\\nof various hormones.\\nii) Ion channels.  The activated receptor for ion exchange such\\nas for sodium, potassium and calcium and certain peptide\\nhormones, determines inward or outward movement of these\\nmolecules.\\niii)G-protein receptors.  These are trans-membranous\\nreceptors and activate phosphorylating enzymes for\\nmetabolic and synthetic functions of cells. \\uf020The activation of\\nadenosine monophosphate-phosphatase cycle (c-AMP) bythe G-proteins (guanosine nucleotide binding regulatoryproteins) is the most important signal system, also known\\nas ‘second messenger’ activation. The activated second\\nmessenger \\uf020(cyclic-AMP) then regulates other intracellular\\nactivities.\\nHeat Shock Proteins and Ubiquitin\\nTwo proteins which move molecules within the cell\\ncytoplasm are heat shock proteins (HSP ) (also called stress\\nproteins ) and ubiquitin  (so named due to its universal presence\\nin the cells of the body).\\nHSPs.  These are a variety of intracellular carrier proteins\\npresent in most cells of the body, especially in renal tubular\\nepithelial cells. They normally perform the role of chaperones\\n(house-keeping) i.e. they direct and guide metabolicmolecules to the sites of metabolic activity e.g. proteinfolding, disaggregation of protein-protein complexes and\\ntransport of proteins into various intracellular organelles\\n(protein kinesis ). However, in response to stresses of various\\ntypes (e.g. toxins, drugs, poisons, ischaemia), their level goesup both inside the cell as well as they leak out into the plasma,\\nand hence the name stress proteins.\\nIn experimental studies HSPs have been shown to limit\\ntissue necrosis in ischaemic reperfusion injury in myocardialinfarcts. In addition, they have also been shown to have a\\ncentral role in protein aggregation in amyloidosis.\\nUbiquitin.  This is another related stress protein which has\\nubiquitous presence in human body cells. Like HSPs,\\nubiquitin too directs intracellular molecules for eitherdegradation or for synthesi s. Ubiquitin has been found to be\\ninvolved in a variety of human degenerative diseases,especially in the nervous system in aging e.g. activation ofgenes for protein synthesis in neurodegenerative diseases\\nsuch as in Alzheimer’s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,\\nParkinson’s disease.\\nCELL CYCLE\\nMultiplication of the somatic (mitosis) and germ (meiosis)\\ncells is the most complex of all cell functions. Mitosis is\\ncontrolled by genes which encode for release of specific\\nproteins molecules that promote or inhibit the process of\\nmitosis at different steps. Mitosis-promoting protein\\nmolecules are cyclins A, B and E . These cyclins activate cyclin-\\ndependent kinases (CDKs) which act in conjunction with\\ncyclins .\\uf020After the mitosis is complete, cyclins and CDKs are\\ndegraded and the residues of used molecules are taken up\\nby cytoplasmic caretaker proteins, ubiquitin,  to the\\nperoxisome for further degradation.\\nPeriod between the mitosis is called interphase . The cell\\ncycle  is the phase between two consecutive divisions\\n(Fig.  3.5). There are 4 sequential phases in the cell cycle: G\\n1\\n(gap 1) phase, S (synthesis) phase, G2 (gap 2) phase, and M\\n(mitotic) phase.\\nG1 (Pre-mitotic gap) phase  is the stage when messenger\\nRNAs for the proteins and the proteins themselves required\\nfor DNA synthesis (e.g. DNA polymerase) are synthesised.The process is under control of cyclin E and CDKs.\\nS\\xa0phase  involves replication of nuclear DNA. Cyclin A and\\nCDKs control it.G\\n2 (Pre-mitotic gap) phase  is the short gap phase in which\\ncorrectness of DNA synthesised is assessed. This stage is\\npromoted by cyclin B and CDKs.\\nM phase  is the stage in which process of mitosis to form two\\ndaughter cells is completed. This occurs in 4 sequential\\nstages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase , and telophase   (acronym=\\nPMAT).\\n Prophase.  Each chromosome divides into 2 chromatids\\nwhich are held together by centromere. The centriole divides\\nand the two daughter centrioles move towards opposite poles\\nof the nucleus and the nuclear membrane disintegrates.\\nMetaphase.  The microtubules become arranged between\\nthe two centrioles forming spindle, while the chromosomesline up at the equatorial plate of the spindle.\\nAnaphase.  The centromeres divide and each set of\\nseparated chromosomes moves towards the opposite polesof the spindle. Cell membrane also begins to divide.\\nTelophase.  There is formation of nuclear membrane around\\neach set of chromosomes and reconstitution of the nucleus.\\nThe cytoplasm of the two daughter cells completely\\nseparates.\\nG0\\xa0phase.  The daughter cells may continue to remain in the\\ncell cycle and divide further, or may go out of the cell cycle\\ninto resting phase, called G0 phase.\\nStimulation of mitosis can be studied in a number of ways\\nas under:\\nCompensatory stimulation  of mitosis by removal of part of\\nan organ.\\nReparative stimulation  of mitosis occurs when a tissue is\\ninjured.27CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations\\nTarget organ stimulation  of mitosis occurs under the\\ninfluence of specific hormones which have mitogenic effect\\non cells of the target organ.\\nETIOLOGY OF CELL INJURY\\nThe cells may be broadly injured by two major ways:\\nA. By genetic causes\\nB. By acquired causes\\nThe genetic causes of various diseases are discussed in\\nChapter 10. The acquired causes of disease comprise vast\\nmajority of common diseases afflicting mankind. Based onunderlying agent, the acquired causes of cell injury can befurther categorised as under:1. Hypoxia and ischaemia2. Physical agents3.Chemical agents and drugs\\n4.\\nMicrobial agents5. Immunologic agents6. Nutritional derangements7. Aging8. Psychogenic diseases9. Iatrogenic factors10. Idiopathic diseases.\\nIn a given situation, more than one of the above etiologic\\nfactors may be involved. These are briefly outlined below.\\n1. HYPOXIA AND ISCHAEMIA.   Cells of different tissues\\nessentially require oxygen to generate energy and perform\\nmetabolic functions. Deficiency of oxygen or hypoxia results\\nin failure to carry out these activities by the cells. Hypoxia is\\nthe most common cause of cell injury. Hypoxia may result\\nfrom the following:\\nThe most common mechanism of hypoxic cell injury is\\nby reduced supply of blood to cells due to interruption i.e.\\nischaemia.Figure 3.5 The cell cycle in mitosis. Premitotic phases are the G1, S and G2 phase while M (mitotic) phase is accomplished in 4 sequential\\nstages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. On completion of cell division, two daughter cells are formed which may continue to\\nremain in the cell cycle or go out of it in resting phase (interphase), the G0 phase. (CDK = cyclin dependent kinase).\\n28SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesHowever, hypoxia may result from other causes as well\\ne.g. disorders of oxygen-carrying RBCs (e.g. anaemia, carbon\\nmonoxide poisoning), heart diseases, lung diseases andincreased demand of tissues.\\n2. PHYSICAL AGENTS.  Physical agents in causation of\\ndisease are as under:\\nmechanical trauma (e.g. road accidents);\\nthermal trauma (e.g. by heat and cold);\\nelectricity;\\nradiation (e.g. ultraviolet and ionising); and\\nrapid changes in atmospheric pressure.\\n3. CHEMICALS AND DRUGS.  An ever increasing list of\\nchemical agents and drugs may cause cell injury. Important\\nexamples include the following:\\nchemical poisons such as cyanide, arsenic, mercury;\\nstrong acids and alkalis;\\nenvironmental pollutants;\\ninsecticides and pesticides;\\noxygen at high concentrations;\\nhypertonic glucose and salt;\\nsocial agents such as alcohol and narcotic drugs; and\\ntherapeutic administration of drugs.\\n4. MICROBIAL AGENTS.  Injuries by microbes include\\ninfections caused by bacteria, rickettsiae, viruses, fungi,\\nprotozoa, metazoa, and other parasites.\\nDiseases caused by biologic agents are discussed in\\nChapter 7.\\n5. IMMUNOLOGIC  AGENTS.  Immunity is a ‘double-\\nedged sword’—it protects the host against various injurious\\nagents but it may also turn lethal and cause cell injury e.g.\\nhypersensitivity reactions;\\nanaphylactic reactions; and\\nautoimmune diseases.\\nImmunologic tissue injury  is discussed in Chapter 4.\\n6. NUTRITIONAL DERANGEMENTS.  A deficiency or an\\nexcess of nutrients may result in nutritional imbalances.\\nNutritional deficiency diseases may be due to overall\\ndeficiency of nutrients (e.g. starvation), of protein calorie (e.g.\\nmarasmus, kwashiorkor), of minerals (e.g. anaemia), or oftrace elements.\\nNutritional excess is a problem of affluent societies\\nresulting in obesity, atherosclerosis, heart disease andhypertension.\\nNutritional diseases are discussed in Chapter 9.\\n7.AGING. Cellular aging or senescence leads to impaired\\nability of the cells to undergo replication and repair, andultimately lead to cell death culminating in death of theindividual. This aspect is dealt at the end of this chapter.\\n8. PSYCHOGENIC DISEASES.  There are no specific\\nbiochemical or morphologic changes in common acquired\\nmental diseases due to mental stress, strain, anxiety,overwork and frustration e.g. depression, schizophrenia.However, problems of drug addiction, alcoholism, andsmoking result in various organic diseases such as liverdamage, chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, peptic ulcer,hypertension, ischaemic heart disease etc.\\n9.IATROGENIC\\n CAUSES.  Although as per Hippocratic\\noath, every physician is bound not to do or administer\\nanything that causes harm to the patient, there are somediseases as well as deaths attributed to iatrogenic causes(owing to physician). Examples include occurrence of diseaseor death due to error in judgment by the physician anduntoward effects of administered therapy (drugs, radiation).\\n10. IDIOPATHIC DISEASES.  Idiopathic means “of\\nunknown cause”. Finally,  although so much is known about\\nthe etiology of diseases, there still remain many diseases forwhich exact cause is undetermined. For example, mostcommon form of hypertension (90%) is idiopathic (oressential) hypertension. Similarly, exact etiology of manycancers is still incompletely known.\\nPATHOGENESIS OF CELL INJURY\\nInjury to the normal cell by one or more of the above listedetiologic agents may result in a state of reversible orirreversible cell injury. The underlying alterations inbiochemical systems of cells for reversible and irreversiblecell injury by various agents is complex and varied. However,in general, the following principles  apply in pathogenesis of\\nmost forms of cell injury by various agents:\\n1. Type, duration and severity of injurious agent:  The\\nextent of cellular injury depends upon type, duration and\\nseverity of the stimulus e.g. small dose of chemical toxin orshort duration of ischaemia cause reversible cell injury whilelarge dose of the same chemical agent or persistent ischaemiacause cell death.\\n2.Type, status and adaptability\\n of target cell: The type of\\ncell as regards its susceptibility to injury, its nutritional and\\nmetabolic status, and adaptation of the cell to hostileenvironment determine the extent of cell injury e.g. skeletalmuscle can withstand hypoxic injury for long-time whilecardiac muscle suffers irreversible cell injury after 20-30minutes of persistent ischaemia.\\n3. Underlying intracellular phenomena: Irrespective of\\nother factors, following essential biochemical phenomena\\nunderlie all forms of cell injury:\\ni) Mitochondrial damage causing ATP depletion.\\nii) Cell membrane damage disturbing the metabolic and\\ntrans-membrane exchanges.\\niii). Release of toxic free radicals.\\n4. Morphologic consequences:  All forms of biochemical\\nchanges underlying cell injury are expressed in terms of\\nmorphologic changes. The ultrastructural changes becomeapparent earlier than the light microscopic alterations. Themorphologic changes of reversible cell injury (e.g. hydropicswelling) appear earlier than morphologic alterations in celldeath (e.g. in myocardial infarction).\\nThe interruption of blood supply (i.e. ischaemia) and\\nimpaired oxygen supply to the tissues (i.e. hypoxia) aremost common form of cell injury in human beings. Patho-29CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptationsgenesis of hypoxic and ischaemic cell injury is, therefore,\\ndescribed in detail below followed by brief discussion onpathogenesis of chemical and physical (ionising radiation)agents.\\nPATHOGENESIS OF ISCHAEMIC AND HYPOXIC INJURY\\nIschaemia and hypoxia are the most common forms of cell\\ninjury. Although underlying intracellular mechanisms andultrastructural changes involved in reversible andirreversible cell injury by hypoxia and ischaemia dependingupon extent of hypoxia and type of cells are involved are acontinuation of the process, these mechanisms are discussedseparately below and illustrated diagrammatically inFigs. 3.6  and  3.7:\\nREVERSIBLE CELL\\xa0INJURY.  If the ischaemia or hypoxia is\\nof short duration, the effects may be reversible on rapidrestoration of circulation e.g. in coronary artery occlusion,myocardial contractility, metabolism and ultrastructure arereversed if the circulation is quickly restored. The sequentialbiochemical and ultrastructural changes in reversible cellinjury are as under (Fig.\\xa03.7,A):\\n1. Decreased generation of\\ncellular ATP: Damage by\\nischaemia versus\\x02 hypoxia  from other  causes.\\uf020All living cells\\nrequire continuous supply of oxygen to produce ATP whichis essentially required for a variety of cellular functions (e.g.membrane transport, protein synthesis, lipid synthesis andphospholipid metabolism). ATP in human cell is derivedfrom 2 sources:\\nfirstly,  by aerobic respiration or oxidative phosphorylation\\n(which requires oxygen) in the mitochondria, and\\nsecondly,  cells may switch over to anaerobic glycolytic\\noxidation to maintain constant supply of ATP (in which ATP\\nis generated from glucose/glycogen in the absence ofoxygen).\\nIschaemia due to interruption in blood supply as well as\\nhypoxia from other causes limit the supply of oxygen to thecells, thus causing decreased ATP generation from ADP:\\n\\uf020In ischaemia , aerobic respiration as well as glucose availa-\\nbility are both compromised resulting in more severe andfaster effects of cell injury. Ischaemic cell injury also causesaccumulation of metabolic waste products in the cells.\\n\\uf020On the other hand, in hypoxia  from other causes  (RBC\\ndisorders, heart disease, lung disease), anaerobic glycolyticATP generation continues, and thus cell injury is less severe.\\nHowever, highly specialised cells such as myocardium,\\nproximal tubular cells of the kidney, and neurons of the CNSare dependent solely on aerobic respiration for ATPgeneration and thus these tissues suffer from ill-effects ofischaemia more severely and rapidly.\\n2. Intracellular lactic acidosis:Nuclear clumping.   Due to\\nlow oxygen supply to the cell, aerobic respiration by\\nFigure 3.6 Sequence of events in the pathogenesis of reversible and irreversible cell injury caused by hypoxia/ischaemia.\\n30SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesmitochondria fails first. This is followed by switch to\\nanaerobic glycolytic pathway for the requirement of energy(i.e. ATP). This results in rapid depletion of glycogen and\\naccumulation of lactic acid lowering the intracellular pH.\\nEarly fall in intracellular pH (i.e. intracellular lactic acidosis)\\nresults in clumping of nuclear chromatin.\\n3. Damage to plasma membrane pumps: Hydropic\\nswelling and other membrane changes. Lack of ATP\\ninterferes in generation of phospholipids from the cellular\\nfatty acids which are required for continuous repair of\\nmembranes. This results in damage to membrane pumpsoperating for regulation of sodium and calcium as under:\\ni) Failure of sodium-potassium pump. Normally, the energy\\n(ATP)-dependent sodium pump (Na\\n+-K+ ATPase) operating\\nat the plasma membrane allows active transport of sodium\\nout of the cell and diffusion of potassium into the cell.\\nLowered ATP in the cell and consequent increased ATPase\\nactivity interfere with this membrane-regulated process. This\\nresults in intracellular accumulation of sodium and diffusion\\nof potassium out of cell. The accumulation of sodium in thecell leads to increase in intracellular water to maintain iso-\\nosmotic conditions (i.e. hydropic swelling occurs, discussed\\nlater in the chapter).\\nii) Failure of calcium pump.  Membrane damage causes\\ndisturbance in the calcium ion exchange across the cell\\nmembrane. Excess of calcium moves into the cell (i.e. calcium\\ninflux), particularly in the mitochondria, causing its swelling\\nand deposition of phospholipid-rich amorphous densities.\\nUltrastructural evidence of reversible cell membrane\\ndamage is seen in the form of loss of microvilli,\\nintramembranous particles and focal projections of thecytoplasm (blebs). Myelin figures  may be seen lying in the\\ncytoplasm or present outside the cell, these are derived frommembranes (plasma or organellar) enclosing water and\\ndissociated lipoproteins between the lamellae of injured\\nmembranes.\\n4. Reduced protein synthesis: Dispersed ribosomes.  As a\\nresult of continued hypoxia, membranes of endoplasmic\\nreticulum and Golgi apparatus swell up. Ribosomes are\\ndetached from granular endoplasmic reticulum andpolysomes are degraded to monosomes, thus dispersing\\nribosomes in the cytoplasm and inactivating their function.\\nSimilar reduced protein synthesis occurs in Golgi apparatus.\\nUp to this point, withdrawal of acute stress that resulted\\nin reversible cell injury can restore the cell to normal state.\\nIRREVERSIBLE CELL INJURY.  Persistence of ischaemia or\\nhypoxia results in irreversible damage to the structure and\\nfunction of the cell (cell death). The stage at which this point\\nof no return  or irreversibility  is reached from reversible cell\\ninjury is unclear but the sequence of events is a continuation\\nof reversibly injured cell. Two essential phenomena always\\ndistinguish irreversible from reversible cell injury\\x02 (Fig. 3.6):\\nInability of the cell to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction\\non reperfusion or reoxygenation.\\nDisturbance in cell membrane function  in general, and in\\nplasma membrane in particular.\\nIn addition, there is further reduction in ATP, continued\\ndepletion of proteins, reduced intracellular pH, and leakageof lysosomal enzymes into the cytoplasm. These biochemicalchanges have effects on the ultrastructural components of\\nthe cell (Fig. 3.7):\\n1. Calcium\\xa0influx:\\xa0Mitochondrial\\xa0damage.  As a result of\\ncontinued hypoxia, a large cytosolic influx of calcium ionsoccurs, especially after reperfusion of irreversibly injured cell.Excess intracellular calcium collects in the mitochondriadisabling its function. Morphologically, mitochondrialchanges are vacuoles in the mitochondria and deposits of\\namorphous calcium salts in the mitochondrial matrix.\\n2. Activated phospholipases: Membrane  damage.  Damage\\nto membrane function in general, and plasma membrane in\\nparticular, is the most important event in irreversible cell\\ninjury in ischaemia. As a result of sustained ischaemia, thereis increased cytosolic influx of calcium in the cell. Increasedcalcium activates endogenous phospholipases . These in turn\\ndegrade membrane phospholipids progressively which arethe main constituent of the lipid bilayer membrane. Besides,\\nthere is also decreased replacement-synthesis of membrane\\nphospholipids due to reduced ATP. Other lytic enzymewhich is activated is ATPase  which causes further depletion\\nof ATP.\\n3\\n. Intracellular proteases: Cytoskeletal damage.  The\\nnormal cytoskeleton of the cell (microfilaments, microtubules\\nand intermediate filaments) which anchors the cellmembrane is damaged due to degradation by activatedintracellular proteases or by physical effect of cell swelling\\nproducing irreversible cell membrane injury.\\n4. Activated endonucleases: Nuclear damage.  The\\nnucleoproteins are damaged by the activated lysosomal\\nenzymes such as proteases and endonucleases. Irreversible\\ndamage  to the nucleus can be in three forms:\\ni) Pyknosis:  Condensation and clumping of nucleus which\\nbecomes dark basophilic.\\nii) Karyorrhexis:  Nuclear fragmentation in to small bits\\ndispersed in the cytoplasm.\\niii) Karyolysis:  Dissolution of the nucleus.\\n5. Lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes: Lysosomal damage, cell\\ndeath and phagocytosis.  The lysosomal membranes are\\ndamaged and result in escape of lysosomal hydrolytic\\nenzymes. These enzymes are activated due to lack of oxygenin the cell and acidic pH. These hydrolytic enzymes include:\\nhydrolase, RNAase, DNAase, protease, glycosidase, phos-\\nphatase, lipase, amylase, cathepsin etc) which on activationbring about enzymatic digestion of cellular components andhence cell death. The dead cell is eventually replaced bymasses of phospholipids called myelin figures  which are either\\nphagocytosed by macrophages or there may be formation of\\ncalcium soaps.\\nLiberated enzymes just mentioned leak across the\\nabnormally permeable cell membrane into the serum, the\\nestimation of which may be used as clinical parameters ofcell death. For example, in myocardial infarction, estimationof elevated serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT),\\nlactic dehydrogenase (LDH), isoenzyme of creatine kinase\\n(CK-MB), and more recently cardiac troponins (cTn) areuseful guides for death of heart muscle. Some of the commonenzyme markers of cell death in different forms of cell death\\nare given in Table 3.1.31CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations\\nWhile cell damage from oxygen deprivation by above\\nmechanisms develops slowly, taking several minutes to\\nhours, the cell injury is accentuated after restoration of bloodsupply and subsequent events termed ischaemic-reperfusion\\ninjury and liberation of toxic free radicals , discussed below.Ischaemia-Reperfusion Injury and\\nFree Radical-Mediated Cell Injury\\nDepending upon the duration of ischaemia/hypoxia,\\nrestoration of blood flow may result in the following3 different consequences:Figure 3.7 Ultrastructural changes during cell injury due to hypoxia-ischaemia.\\n32SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\n1. From ischaemia to reversible injury.  When the period of\\nischaemia is of short duration,  reperfusion with resupply of\\noxygen restores the structural and functional state of the\\ninjured cell i.e. reversible cell injury.\\n2. From ischaemia to reperfusion injury.  When ischaemia is\\nfor longer duration,  then rather than restoration of structure\\nand function of the cell, reperfusion paradoxically\\ndeteriorates the already injured cell. This is termedischaemia-reperfusion injury.\\n3. From ischaemia to irreversible injury.  Much longer period\\nof ischaemia may produce irreversible cell injury during\\nischaemia itself when so much time has elapsed that neither\\nblood flow restoration is helpful nor reperfusion injury can\\ndevelop. Cell death in such cases is not attributed to\\nformation of activated oxygen species. But instead, on\\nreperfusion there is further marked intracellular excess ofsodium and calcium ions due to persistent cell membranedamage.\\nThe underlying mechanism of reperfusion injury and free\\nradical mediated injury is complex but following  three main\\ncomponents are involved in it:1.Calcium overload.\\n2. Generation of reactive oxygen radicals (superoxide, H\\n2O2,\\nhydroxyl radicals) .\\n3. Subsequent inflammatory reaction.\\nThese are discussed below:\\n1. CALCIUM OVERLOAD.  Upon restoration of blood\\nsupply, the ischaemic cell is further bathed by the blood fluid\\nthat has more calcium ions at a time when the ATP stores ofthe cell are low. This results in further calcium overload onthe already injured cells, triggering lipid peroxidation of themembrane causing further membrane damage.\\n2. GENERATION OF\\nREACTIVE OXYGEN RADICALS.\\nAlthough oxygen is the lifeline of all cells and tissues, its\\nmolecular forms as reactive oxygen radicals or reactiveoxygen species can be most devastating for the cells. In recent\\ntimes, free radical-mediated cell injury has been extensively\\nstudied and a brief account is given below.\\nMechanism of oxygen free radical generation.  Normally,\\nmetabolism of the cell involves generation of ATP by\\noxidative process in which biradical oxygen (O\\n2) combines\\nwith hydrogen atom (H) and in the process forms water(H\\n2O). This reaction of O2  to H2O involves ‘four electron\\ndonation’ in four steps involving transfer of one electron ateach step.  Oxygen free radicals are the intermediate chemicalspecies having an unpaired oxygen in their outer orbit. Theseare generated within mitochondrial inner membrane wherecytochrome oxidase catalyses the O\\n2  to H2O reaction. Three\\nintermediate molecules of partially reduced species of oxygenare generated depending upon the number of electronstransferred\\x02 (Fig. 3.8):\\nSuperoxide oxygen (O’2): one electron\\nHydrogen peroxide (H2O2): two electrons\\nHydroxyl radical (OH–): three electrons\\nThese are generated from enzymatic and non-enzymatic\\nreaction as under:\\n1.Superoxide (O’2): Superoxide anion O ’2 may be generated\\nby direct auto-oxidation of O2 during mitochondrial electron\\ntransport reaction. Alternatively, O ’2 is produced\\nenzymatically by xanthine oxidase and cytochrome P450 in\\nthe mitochondria or cytosol. O ’2 so formed is catabolised to\\nproduce H2O2 by superoxide dismutase (SOD).\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 3.1: Common Enzyme Markers of Cell Death.\\nEnzyme Disease\\n1.Aspartate aminotransferase Diffuse liver cell necrosis e.g.\\n(AST, SGOT) viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver\\ndisease\\nAcute myocardial infarction\\n2.Alanine aminotransferase More specific for diffuse liver\\n(ALT, SGPT) cell damage than AST e.g.\\nviral hepatitis\\n3.Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) Acute myocardial infarction,myocarditisSkeletal muscle injury\\n4.Lipase More specific for acutepancreatitis\\n5.Amylase Acute pancreatitisSialadenitis\\n6.Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) Acute myocardial infarctionMyocarditisSkeletal muscle injury\\n7.Cardiac troponin (CTn) Specific for acute myocardialinfarction\\nFigure 3.8 Mechanisms of generation of free radicals by four electron step reduction of oxygen. (SOD = superoxide dismutase;\\nGSH = glutathione peroxidase).\\n33CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations2.Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2): H2O2 is reduced to water\\nenzymatically by catalase (in the peroxisomes) and\\nglutathione peroxidase GSH (both in the cytosol andmitochondria).\\n3.Hydroxyl radical (OH\\n–): OH– radical is formed by 2 ways\\nin biologic processes—by radiolysis of water and by reaction\\nof H2O2 with ferrous (Fe++) ions; the latter process is termed\\nas Fenton reaction.\\nOther oxygen free radicals.  In addition to superoxide, H2O2\\nand hydroxyl radicals generated during of O2  to H2O\\nreaction, a few other more active oxygen free  radicals which\\nformed in the body are as follows:\\ni) Release of superoxide free radical in Fenton reaction  (see\\nbelow).\\nii)Nitric oxide (NO) , a chemical mediator generated by\\nvarious body cells (endothelial cells, neurons, macrophages\\netc), combines with superoxide and forms peroxynitrate(ONOO) which is a potent free radical.\\niii)  Halide reagent (chlorine or chloride) released in the\\nleucocytes reacts with superoxide and forms hypochlorous acid(HOCl)  which is a cytotoxic free radical.\\niv) Exogenous sources  of free radicals include some environ-\\nmental agents such as tobacco and industrial pollutants.\\nCytotoxicity of oxygen free radicals.  Free radicals are formed\\nin physiologic as well as pathologic processes. Basically,\\noxygen radicals are unstable and are destroyed spon-\\ntaneously. The rate of spontaneous destruction is determined\\nby catalytic action of certain enzymes such as superoxidedismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Thenet effect of free radical injury in physiologic and diseasestates, therefore, depends upon the rate of free radicalformation and rate of their elimination.\\nHowever, if not degraded, then free radicals are highly\\ndestructive to the cell since they have electron-free residueand thus bind to all molecules of the cell; this is termedoxidative stress .  Out of various free radicals, hydroxyl radical\\nis the most reactive species. Free radicals may producemembrane damage by the following mechanisms \\xa0(Fig.\\xa03.9 ):\\ni)Lipid peroxidation.  Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of\\nmembrane are attacked repeatedly and severely by oxygen-\\nderived free radicals to yield highly destructive PUFAradicals—lipid hydroperoxy radicals and lipid hypo-peroxides. This reaction is termed lipid peroxidation. Thelipid peroxides are decomposed by transition metals such\\nas iron. Lipid peroxidation is propagated to other sites\\ncausing widespread membrane damage and destruction oforganelles.\\nii)Oxidation of proteins.  Oxygen-derived free radicals cause\\ncell injury by oxidation of protein macromolecules of the cells,\\ncrosslinkages of labile amino acids as well as by fragmen-tation of polypeptides directly. The end-result is degradationof cytosolic neutral proteases and cell destruction.\\niii)DNA damage.  Free radicals cause breaks in the single\\nstrands of the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. This results\\nin cell injury; it may also cause malignant transformation ofcells.\\niv)Cytoskeletal damage.  Reactive oxygen species are also\\nknown to interact with cytoskeletal elements and interfere\\nin mitochondrial aerobic phosphorylation and thus causeATP depletion.\\nConditions with free radical injury.  Currently, oxygen-\\nderived free radicals have been known to play an importan t\\nrole in many forms of cell injury:\\ni)\\nIschaemic reperfusion injury\\nii) Ionising radiation by causing radiolysis of water\\niii) Chemical toxicity\\niv) Chemical carcinogenesisv) Hyperoxia (toxicity due to oxygen therapy)vi) Cellular agingvii) Killing of microbial agents\\nviii)  Inflammatory damageix) Destruction of tumour cellsx) Atherosclerosis.\\nAntioxidants.  Antioxidants are endogenous or exogenous\\nsubstances which inactivate the free radicals. These\\nsubstances include the following:\\nVitamins E, A and C (ascorbic acid)\\nSulfhydryl-containing compounds e.g. cysteine and\\nglutathione.\\nSerum proteins e.g. ceruloplasmin and transferrin.\\n3. SUBSEQUENT INFLAMMATORY EACTION.\\nIschaemia-reperfusion event is followed by inflammatoryreaction. Incoming activated neutrophils utilise oxygenquickly ( oxygen burst ) and release a lot of oxygen free radicals.\\nIschaemia is also associated with accumulation of precursorsof ATP, namely ADP and pyruvate, which further build-upgeneration of free radicals.\\nPathogenesis of Chemical Injury\\nChemicals induce cell injury by one of the two mechanisms:\\nby direct cytotoxicity, or by conversion of chemical into\\nreactive metabolites.\\nDIRECT CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS.  Some chemicals combine\\nwith components of the cell and produce direct cytotoxicity\\nwithout requiring metabolic activation. The cytotoxic damageis usually greatest to cells which are involved in themetabolism of such chemicals e.g. in mercuric chloride\\nFigure 3.9 Mechanism of cell death by hydroxyl radical, the most\\nreactive oxygen species.\\n34SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\npoisoning, the greatest damage occurs to cells of the alimen-\\ntary tract where it is absorbed and kidney where it is excreted.Cyanide \\uf020kills the cell by poisoning mitochondrial cyto-\\nchrome oxidase thus blocking oxidative phosphorylation.\\nOther examples of directly cytotoxic chemicals include\\nchemotherapeutic agents used in treatment of cancer, toxicheavy metals such as mercury, lead and iron.\\nCONVERSION\\xa0 TO\\xa0REACTIVE\\xa0TOXIC\\xa0METABOLITES.\\nThis mechanism involves metabolic activation to yield\\nultimate toxin that interacts with the target cells. The target\\ncells in this group of chemicals may not be the same cell that\\nmetabolised the toxin. Example of cell injury by conversion\\nof reactive metabolites is toxic liver necrosis caused by carbon\\ntetrachloride (CCl\\n4), acetaminophen (commonly used anal-\\ngesic and antipyretic) and bromobenzene. Cell injury by CCl4\\nis classic example of an industrial toxin (earlier used in dry-cleaning industry) that produces cell injury by conversion\\nto a highly toxic free radical, CCl\\n3, in the body’s drug-meta-\\nbolising P450 enzyme system in the liver cells. Thus, it\\nproduces profound liver cell injury by free radical generation.Other mechanism of cell injury includes direct toxic effect\\non cell membrane and nucleus.\\nPathogenesis of Physical Injury\\nInjuries caused by mechanical force are of medicolegal\\nsignificance. But they may lead to a state of shock. Injuriesby changes in atmospheric pressure (e.g. decompressionsickness) are detailed in Chapter 5. Radiation injury to humanby accidental or therapeutic exposure is of importance intreatment of persons with malignant tumours as well as mayhave carcinogenic influences (Chapter 8).\\nKilling of cells by ionising radiation  is the result of direct\\nformation of hydroxyl radicals from radiolysis of water(Fig.\\xa0 3.10) . These hydroxyl radicals damage the cell memb-rane as well as may interact with DNA of the target cell. Inproliferating cells, there is inhibition of DNA replication andeventual cell death by apoptosis (e.g. epithelial cells). In non-proliferating cells there is no effect of inhibition of DNAsynthesis and in these cells there is cell membrane damagefollowed by cell death by necrosis (e.g. neurons).\\nMORPHOLOGY OF CELL INJURY\\nAfter having discussed the molecular and biochemicalmechanisms of various forms of cell injury, we now turn tolight microscopic morphologic changes of reversible andirreversible cell injury.\\nDepending upon the severity of cell injury, degree of\\ndamage and residual effects on cells and tissues are variable.In general, morphologic changes in various forms of cellinjury can be classified as shown in Table 3.2and are\\ndiscussed below.\\nMORPHOLOGY  OF REVERSIBLE CELL INJURY\\nIn conventional description of morphologic changes, the term\\ndegeneration has been used to denote morphology ofreversible cell injury. However, now it is realised that thisterm does not provide any information on the nature ofunderlying changes and thus currently more acceptableterms of retrogressive changes  or simply reversible cell injury\\nare applied to non-lethal cell injury.\\nFollowing morphologic forms of reversible cell injury are\\nincluded under this heading:\\n1.Hydropic change (cloudy swelling, or vacuolar\\ndegeneration)\\n2.\\nFatty change\\n3. Hyaline change\\n4.Mucoid change\\nHydropic Change\\nHydropic change means accumulation of water within the\\ncytoplasm of the cell. Other synonyms used are cloudy\\nswelling  (for gross appearance of the affected organ) and\\nvacuolar degeneration  (due to cytoplasmic vacuolation).\\nETIOLOGY.  This is the commo nest and earliest form of cell\\ninjury from almost all causes. The common causes include\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 3.2: Classification of Morphologic Forms of\\nCell Injury.\\nMechanism of Nomenclature\\nCell Injury\\n1.Reversible cell injury Retrogressive changes\\n(older term: degenerations)\\n2.Irreversible cell injury Cell death—necrosis\\n3.Programmed cell death Apoptosis\\n4.Residual effects of Subcellular alterations\\ncell injury\\n5.Deranged cell metabolism Intracellular accumulationof lipid, protein, carbohydrate\\n6.After-effects of necrosis Gangrene, pathologic calcificationFigure 3.10 Mechanisms of cell injury by ionising radiation.\\n35CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptationsacute and subacute cell injury from various etiologic agents\\nsuch as bacterial toxins, chemicals, poisons, burns, high fever,intravenous administration of hypertonic glucose or salineetc.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Cloudy swelling results from impaired\\nregulation of sodium and potassium at the level of cell\\nmembrane. This results in intracellular accumulation ofsodium and escape of potassium. This, in turn, leads to rapidflow of water into the cell to maintain iso-osmotic conditionsand hence cellular swelling occurs. In addition, influx ofcalcium too occurs. Hydropic swelling is an entirelyreversible change upon removal of the injurious agent.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the affected\\norgan such as kidney, liver, pancreas, or heart muscle isenlarged due to swelling. The cut surface bulges outwardsand is slightly opaque.Microscopically,  it is characterised by the following\\nfeatures (Fig. 3.11):\\ni) The cells are swollen and the microvasculaturecompressed.ii) Small clear vacuoles are seen in the cells and hencethe term vacuolar degeneration. These vacuoles representdistended cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum.\\niii) Small cytoplasmic blebs may be seen.\\niv) The nucleus may appear pale.\\nHyaline Change\\nThe word ‘hyaline’ means glassy ( hyalos  = glass). Hyaline is\\na descriptive histologic term for glassy, homogeneous,\\neosinophilic appearance of material in haematoxylin and\\neosin-stained sections and does not refer to any specific\\nsubstance. Though fibrin and amyloid have hyaline appear-ance, they have distinctive features and staining reactions\\nand can be distinguished from non-specific hyaline material.\\nHyaline change is associated with heterogeneous pathologicconditions. It may be intracellular or extracellular.INTRACELLULAR HYALINE.  Intracellular hyaline is\\nmainly seen in epithelial cells. A few examples are as follows:\\n1.Hyaline droplets  in the proximal tubular epithelial cells in\\ncases of excessive reabsorption of plasma proteins.\\n2.Hyaline degeneration  of rectus abdominalis muscle called\\nZenker’s degeneration, occurring in typhoid fever. The\\nmuscle loses its fibrillar staining and becomes glassy andhyaline.\\n3.Mallory’s hyaline  represents aggregates of intermediate\\nfilaments in the hepatocytes in alcoholic liver cell injury.4.Nuclear or cytoplasmic hyaline inclusions  seen in some\\nviral infections.5.Russell’s bodies  representing excessive immunoglobulins\\nin the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the plasma cells\\n(Fig. 3.12).\\nEXTRACELLULAR  HYALINE.  Extracellular hyaline is seen\\nin connective tissues. A few examples of extracellular hyaline\\nchange are as under:\\n1\\n. Hyaline degeneration in leiomyomas  of the uterus\\n(Fig.  \\n3.13).\\n2. Hyalinised old scar  of fibrocollagenous tissues.\\n3.Hyaline arteriolosclerosis  in renal vessels in hypertension\\nand diabetes mellitus.4. Hyalinised glomeruli in chronic glomerulonephritis .\\n5.Corpora amylacea  are rounded masses of concentric hya-\\nline laminae seen in the prostate in the elderly, in the brain\\nand in the spinal cord in old age, and in old infarcts of thelung.\\nMucoid Change\\nMucus secreted by mucous glands is a combination of\\nproteins complexed with mucopolysaccharides. Mucin , a\\nglycoprotein, is its chief constituent. Mucin is normallyproduced by epithelial cells of mucous membranes andmucous glands, as well as by some connective tissues likein the umbilical cord. By convention, connective tissuemucin is termed myxoid (mucus like). Both types of mucin\\nFigure 3.11 Hydropic change kidney. The tubular epithelial cells are distended with cytoplasmic vacuoles while the interstitial vasculature  is\\ncompressed. The nuclei of affected tubules are pale.\\n36SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nare stained by alcian blue. However, epithelial mucin stains\\npositively with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), while connectivetissue mucin is PAS negative but is stained positively withcolloidal iron.\\nEPITHELIAL MUCIN.  Following are some examples of\\nfunctional excess of epithelial mucin:\\n1. Catarrhal inflammation of mucous membrane (e.g. of\\nrespiratory tract, alimentary tract, uterus).\\n2. Obstruction of duct leading to mucocele in the oral cavityand gallbladder.\\n3. Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.\\n4. Mucin-secreting tumours (e.g. of ovary, stomach, largebowel etc) (Fig. 3.14) .CONNECTIVE\\n TISSUE  MUCIN.  A few examples of\\ndisturbances of connective tissue mucin are as under:\\n1.

These occur at the level of cytoskeleton, lysosomes,\\nendoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria:\\n1.CYTOSKELETAL CHANGES.  Components of cyto-\\nskeleton may show the following morphologic abnormalities:\\ni) Defective\\xa0microtubules:\\nIn Chédiak-Higashi syndrome characterised by poor\\nphagocytic activity of neutrophils.\\nPoor sperm motility causing sterility.\\nImmotile cilia syndrome (Kartagener’s syndrome)\\ncharacterised by immotile cilia of respiratory tract and\\nconsequent chronic infection due to defective clearance ofinhaled bacteria.\\nDefects in leucocyte function of phagocytes such as\\nmigration and chemotaxis.\\nii)\\xa0Defective\\xa0microfilaments:\\nIn myopathies\\nMuscular dystrophies\\niii)\\xa0Accumulation\\xa0of\\xa0intermediate\\xa0filaments:  Various classes\\nof intermediate filaments (cytokeratin, desmin, vimentin,\\nglial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament) mayaccumulate in the cytosol. For example:\\nMallory’s body or alcoholic hyaline as intracytoplasmic\\neosinophilic inclusion seen in alcoholic liver disease whichis collection of cytokeratin intermediate filaments.\\nNeurofibrillary tangles, neurities and senile plaques in\\nAlzheimer’s disease are composed of neurofilaments andpaired helical filaments.\\n2.L YSOSOMAL CHANGES.  Lysosomes contain powerful\\nhydrolytic enzymes. Heterophagy and autophagy are the two\\nways by which lysosomes show morphologic changes of\\nphagocytic function.\\ni) Heterophagy.  Phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis\\n(cell drinking) are the two forms by which material from\\noutside is taken up by the lysosomes of cells such aspolymorphs and macrophages to form phagolysosomes. This\\nis termed heterophagy. Microbial agents and foreignparticulate material are eliminated by this mechanism.\\nii) Autophagy.  This is the process by which worn out\\nintracellular organelles and other cytoplasmic material form\\nautophagic vacuole that fuses with lysosome to formautophagolysosome .\\niii)Indigestible\\xa0 material.  Some indigestible exogenous\\nparticles such as carbon or endogenous substances such aslipofuscin may persist in the lysosomes of the cells for a long\\ntime as residual bodies.\\niv) Storage\\xa0 diseases.  As discussed in Chapter 10, a group of\\nlysosomal storage diseases due to hereditary deficiency of\\nenzymes may result in abnormal collection of metabolites in\\nthe lysosomes of cells.\\n3.\\xa0SER\\xa0\\nCHANGES.  Hypertrophy of smooth endoplasmic\\nreticulum of liver cells as an adaptive change may occur in\\nresponse to prolonged use of barbiturates.\\n4. MITOCHONDRIAL\\xa0CHANGES.  Mitochondrial injury\\nplays an important role i n cell injury. Morphologic changesof cell injury in mitochondria may be seen in the following\\nconditions:\\ni)Megamitochondria.  Megamitochondria consisting of\\nunusually big mitochondria are seen in alcoholic liver disease\\nand nutritional deficiency conditions.\\nii)\\nAlterations in the number of mitochondria  may occur. Their\\nnumber increases in hypertrophy and decreases in atrophy.iii)Oncocytoma  in the salivary glands, thyroid and kidneys\\nconsists of tumour cells having very large mitochondria.iv)Myopathies  having defect in mitochondria have abnormal\\ncristae.\\nINTRACELLULAR ACCUMULATIONS\\nIntracellular accumulation of substances in abnormal amounts\\ncan occur within the cytoplasm (especially lysosomes) ornucleus of the cell. This phenomenon was previously referredto as infiltration, implying thereby that something unusual\\nhas infiltrated the cell from outside which is not always thecase. Intracellular accumulation of the substance in milddegree causes reversible cell injury while more severe damageresults in irreversible cell injury.\\nSuch abnormal intracellular accumulations can be divided\\ninto 3 groups:i)Accumulation of constituents of normal cell metabolism\\nproduced in excess  e.g. accumulations of lipids (fatty change,\\ncholesterol deposits), proteins and carbohydrates. Inaddition, deposits of amyloid and urate are discussedseparately later.ii)Accumulation of abnormal substances  produced as a result\\nof abnormal metabolism due to lack of some enzymes e.g.storage diseases or inborn errors of metabolism. These arediscussed in Chapter 10.iii)Accumulation of pigments  e.g. endogenous pigments under\\nspecial circumstances, and exogenous pigments due to lackof enzymatic mechanisms to degrade the substances ortransport them to other sites.\\nThese pathologic states are discussed below.\\nFATTY CHANGE (STEAT OSIS)\\nFatty change, steatosis or fatty metamorphosis is theintracellular accumulation of neutral fat within parenchymalcells. It includes the older, now abandoned, terms of fatty\\ndegeneration  and fatty infiltration  because fatty change neither\\nnecessarily involves degeneration nor infiltration. Thedeposit is in the cytosol and represents an absolute increasein the intracellular lipids. It is especially common in the liverbut may occur in other non-fatty tissues like the heart, skeletalmuscle, kidneys (lipoid nephrosis or minimum changedisease) and other organs.\\nFatty Liver\\nLiver is the commonest site for accumulation of fat because\\nit plays central role in fat metabolism. Depending upon thecause and amount of accumulation, fatty change may be mildand reversible, or severe producing irreversible cell injuryand cell death.38SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesETIOLOGY.  Fatty change in the liver may result from one\\nof the two types of causes:\\n1. Conditions with excess fat (hyperlipidameia),  exceeding the\\ncapacity of the liver to metabolise it.\\n2. Liver cell  damage, when fat cannot be metabolised in it.\\nThese causes are listed below:1. Conditions  with\\n excess fat:\\ni) Obesity\\nii) Diabetes mellitusiii) Congenital hyperlipidaemia\\n2. Liver cell damage:i) Alcoholic liver disease (most common)ii) Starvationiii) Protein calorie malnutrition\\niv) Chronic illnesses (e.g. tuberculosis)v) Acute fatty liver in late pregnancyvi\\n) Hypoxia (e.g. anaemia, cardiac failure)\\nvii) Hepatotoxins (e.g. carbon tetrachloride, chloroform,ether, aflatoxins and other poisons)viii) Drug-induced liver cell injury (e.g. administration of\\nmethotrexate, steroids, CCl\\n4, halothane anaesthetic,\\ntetracycline etc)ix)  Reye’s syndrome\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Mechanism of fatty liver depends upon\\nthe stage at which the etiologic agent acts in the normal fat\\ntransport and metabolism. Hence, pathogenesis of fatty liveris best understood in the light of normal fat metabolism inthe liver (Fig.\\xa03.16) .\\nLipids as free acids enter the liver cell from either of the\\nfollowing 2 sources:From diet  as chylomicrons (containing triglycerides and\\nphospholipids) and as free fatty acids; and\\nFrom adipose tissue  as free fatty acids.\\nNormally,  besides above two sources, \\xa0a small part of\\nfatty acids is also synthesised from acetate in the liver cells.Most of free fatty acid is esterified to triglycerides by theaction of α-glycerophosphate and only a small part is\\nchanged into cholesterol, phospholipids and ketone bodies.While cholesterol, phospholipids and ketones are used in thebody, intracellular triglycerides are converted intolipoproteins, which requires ‘lipid acceptor protein’.Lipoproteins are released from the liver cells  into circulationas plasma lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL).\\nIn fatty liver,  intracellular accumulation of triglycerides\\ncan occur due to defect at one or more of the following  6\\nsteps  in the normal fat metabolism shown in Fig. 3.16:\\n1. Increased entry of free fatty acids into the liver.\\n2.Increased synthesis of fatty acids by the liver.\\n3. Decreased conversion of fatty acids into ketone bodies\\nresulting in increased esterification of fatty acids totriglycerides.\\n4. Increased α-glycerophosphate causing increased\\nesterification of fatty acids to triglycerides.5.Decreased synthesis of ‘lipid acceptor protein’ resulting\\nin decreased formation of lipoprotein from triglycerides.6.\\nBlock in the excretion of lipoprotein from the liver into\\nplasma.\\nIn most cases of fatty liver, one of the above mechanisms\\nis operating. But in the case of liver cell injury by chronic\\nalcoholism, many factors are implicated which includes:\\nincreased lipolysis;\\nincreased free fatty acid synthesis;\\ndecreased triglyceride utilisation;\\ndecreased fatty acid oxidation to ketone bodies; and\\nblock in lipoprotein excretion.\\nEven a severe form of liver cell dysfunction may be\\nreversible; e.g. an alcoholic who has not developed\\nprogressive fibrosis in the form of cirrhosis, the enlarged fattyliver may return to normal if the person becomes teetotaller.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly , the liver in fatty\\nchange is enlarged with a tense, glistening capsule androunded margins. The cut surface bulges slightly and ispale-yellow to yellow and is greasy to touch (Fig.\\xa0 3.17) .\\nMicroscopically,  characteristic feature is the presence of\\nnumerous lipid vacuoles in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.Fat in H & E stained section prepared by paraffin-embedding technique appear non-staining vauloesbecause it is dissolved in alcohol \\xa0(Fig.\\xa03.18):\\ni) The vacuoles are initially small and are present aroundthe nucleus (microvesicular) .\\nii) But with progression of the process, the vacuolesbecome larger pushing the nucleus to the periphery ofthe cells (macrovesicular) .\\niii)A\\nt times, the hepatocytes laden with large lipid\\nvacuoles may rupture and lipid vacuoles coalesce to formfatty cysts. Figure 3.16 Lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of fatty liver.\\nDefects in any of the six numbered steps (corresponding to the description\\nin the text) can produce fatty liver by different etiologic agents.\\n39CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations\\niv) Infrequently, lipogranulomas  may appear consisting of\\ncollections of lymphocytes, macrophages, and some multi-\\nnucleated giant cells.v) Fat can be demonstrated in fresh unfixed tissue byfrozen section followed by fat stains  such as Sudan dyes\\n(Sudan III, IV, Sudan black) and oil red O. Alternatively,osmic acid which is a  fixative as well as a stain can beused to demonstrate fat in the tissue.\\nCholesterol Deposits\\nIntracellular deposits of cholesterol and its esters in macro-\\nphages may occur when there is hypercholesterolaemia. Thisturns macrophages into foam cells. The examples are asfollows:1.Fibrofatty plaques  of atherosclerosis (Chapter 15).\\n2. Clusters of foam cells in tumour-like masses called\\nxanthomas  and xanthelasma .\\nStromal Fatty Infiltration\\nThis form of lipid accumulation is quite different from fatty\\nchange just described. Stromal fatty infiltration is thedeposition of mature adipose cells in the stromal connectivetissue in contrast to intracellular deposition of fat in theparenchymal cells in fatty change. The condition occurs mostoften in patients with obesity. The two commonly affectedorgans are the heart and the pancreas. Thus, heart can be thesite for intramyocardial fatty change as well as epicardial(stromal) fatty infiltration. The presence of mature adiposecells in the stroma generally does not produce anydysfunction. In the case of heart, stromal fatty infiltration isassociated with increased adipose tissue in the epicardium.\\nINTRACELLULAR ACCUMULA TION OF PROTEINS\\nPathologic accumulation of proteins in the cytoplasm of cells\\nmay occur in the following conditions:1.\\nIn proteinuria , there is excessive renal tubular reabsorp-\\ntion of proteins by the proximal tubular epithelial cells whichshow pink hyaline droplets in their cytoplasm. The changeis reversible so that with control of proteinuria the proteindroplets disappear.\\n2. The cytoplasm of actively functioning plasma cells shows\\npink hyaline inclusions called Russell’s bodies  representing\\nsynthesised immunoglobulins.\\n3. In \\nα1-antitrypsin deficiency , the cytoplasm of hepatocytes\\nshows eosinophilic globular deposits of a mutant protein.\\n4.Mallory’s body  or alcoholic hyalin in the hepatocytes is\\nintracellular accumulation of intermediate filaments of\\ncytokeratin and appear as amorphous pink masses.\\nFigure 3.17 Fatty liver. Sectioned slice of the liver shows pale yellow\\nparenchyma with rounded borders.\\nFigure 3.18 Fatty liver. Many of the hepatocytes are distended with large fat vacuoles pushing the nuclei to the periphery (macrovesicles),\\nwhile others show multiple small vacuoles in the cytoplasm (microvesicles).\\n40SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesINTRACELLULAR ACCUMULATION OF GLYCOGEN\\nConditions associated with excessive accumulation of\\nintracellular glycogen are as under:\\n1. In diabetes mellitus , there is intracellular accumulation of\\nglycogen in different tissues because normal cellular uptake\\nof glucose is impaired. Glycogen deposits in diabetes mellitusare seen in epithelium of distal portion of proximal convolu-ted tubule and descending loop of Henle, in the hepatocytes,in beta cells of pancreatic islets, and in cardiac muscle cells.Deposits of glycogen produce clear vacuoles in the cytoplasmof the affected cells. Best’s carmine and periodic acid-Schiff(PAS) staining may be employed to confirm the presence ofglycogen in the cells.\\n2.In glycogen storage diseases or glycogenosis , there is defec-\\ntive metabolism of glycogen due to genetic disorders. These\\nconditions along with other similar genetic disorders arediscussed in Chapter 10.\\nPIGMENTS\\nPigments are coloured substances present in most livingbeings including humans. There are 2 broad categories ofpigments: endogenous and exogenous (Table 3.3) .\\nA. ENDOGENOUS PIGMENTS\\nEndogenous pigments  are either normal constituents of cells\\nor accumulate under special circumstances e.g. melanin,\\nochronosis, haemoprotein-derived pigments, and lipofuscin.\\nMelanin\\nMelanin is the brown-black, non-haemoglobin-derived\\npigment normally present in the hair, skin, choroid of theeye, meninges and adrenal medulla. It is synthesised in themelanocytes and dendritic cells, both of which are presentin the basal cells of the epidermis and is stored in th e form of\\ncytoplasmic granules in the phagocytic cells called themelanophores, present in the underlying dermis\\n.\\xa0Melano-\\ncytes possess the enzyme tyrosinase necessary for synthesisof melanin from tyrosine. However, sometimes tyrosinase ispresent but is not active and hence no melanin pigment isvisible. In such cases, the presence of tyrosinase can bedetected by incubation of tissue section in the solution ofdihydroxy phenyl alanine (DOPA). If the enzyme is present,dark pigment is identified in pigment cells. This test is calledas DOPA reaction  and is particularly useful in differentiating\\namelanotic melanoma from other anaplastic tumours.\\nVarious disorders of melanin pigmentation cause\\ngeneralised and localised hyperpigmentation andhypopigmentation:\\ni) Generalised hyperpigmentation:\\na) In Addison’s disease , there is generalised hyper-\\npigmentation of the skin, especially in areas exposed to light,\\nand of buccal mucosa.\\nb)Chloasma  observed during pregnancy is the hyper-\\npigmentation on the skin of face, nipples, and genitalia and\\noccurs under the influence of oestrogen. A similar appear-ance may be observed in women taking oral contraceptives.\\nc) In chronic arsenical poisoning , there is characteristic rain-\\ndrop pigmentation of the skin.\\nii) Focal hyperpigmentation:\\na)Cäfe-au-lait spots  are pigmented patches seen in\\nneurofibromatosis and Albright’s syndrome.\\nb)Peutz-Jeghers syndrome  is characterised by focal peri-oral\\npigmentation.c)Melanosis coli  is pigmentation of the mucosa of the colon.\\nd)Melanotic tumours , both benign such as pigmented naevi\\n(Fig. 3.19 ), and malignant such as melanoma, are associated\\nwith increased melanogenesis.e)Lentigo  is a pre-malignant condition in which there is focal\\nhyperpigmentation on the skin of hands, face, neck, and arms.f)Dermatopathic lymphadenitis  is an example of deposition\\nof melanin pigment in macrophages of the lymph nodesdraining skin lesions.\\niii) Generalised hypopigmentation: Albinism  is an extreme\\ndegree of generalised hypopigmentation in which tyrosinase\\nactivity of the melanocytes is genetically defective and nomelanin is formed. Albinos have blond hair, poor vision andsevere photophobia. They are highly sensitive to sunlight.Chronic sun exposure may lead to precancerous lesions andsquamous and basal cell cancers of the skin in suchindividuals.\\niv) Localised hypopigmentation:\\na)Leucoderma  is a form of partial albinism and is an inherited\\ndisorder.\\nb)Vitiligo  is local hypopigmentation of the skin and is more\\ncommon. It may have familial tendency.c)Acquired focal hypopigmentation  can result from various\\ncauses such as leprosy, healing of wounds, DLE, radiationdermatitis etc.\\nMelanin-like Pigments\\nALKAPTONURIA.  This is a rare autosomal recessive\\ndisorder in which there is deficiency of an oxidase enzyme\\nrequired for break-down of homogentisic acid which thenaccumulates in the tissues and is excreted in the urine(homogentisic aciduria). The urine of patients ofalkaptonuria, if allowed to stand for some hours in air, turnsblack due to oxidation of homogentisic acid. The pigment is\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 3.3: Pigments of the Body.\\nA. ENDOGENOUS PIGMENTS\\n1. Melanin\\n2. Melanin-like pigment\\na.\\nAlkaptonuria\\nb. Dubin-Johnson syndrome\\n3.

Most commonly affected tissues are the cartilages,capsules of joints, ligaments and tendons.\\nDUBIN-JOHNSON\\xa0SYNDROME.  Hepatocytes in patients\\nof Dubin-Johnson syndrome, an autosomal recessive form\\nof hereditary conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, containmelain-like pigment in the cytoplasm (Chapter 21).\\nHaemoprotein-derived Pigments\\nHaemoproteins are the most important endogenous\\npigments derived from haemoglobin, cytochromes and theirbreak-down products. For an understanding of disorders ofhaemoproteins, it is essential to have knowledge of normaliron metabolism and its transport which is described inChapter 12. In disordered iron metabolism and transport,haemoprotein-derived pigments accumulate in the body.These pigments are haemosiderin, acid haematin(haemozoin), bilirubin, and porphyrins.\\n1. HAEMOSIDERIN.  Iron is stored in the tissues in 2 forms:\\nFerritin,  which is iron complexed to apoferritin and can\\nbe identified by electron microscopy.\\nHaemosiderin , which is formed by aggregates of ferritin\\nand is identifiable by light microscopy as golden-yellow to\\nbrown, granular pigment, especially within the mononuclearphagocytes of the bone marrow, spleen and liver wherebreak-down of senescent red cells takes place. Haemosiderinis ferric iron that can be demonstrated by Perl’s stain that\\nproduces Prussian blue reaction. In this reaction, colourless\\npotassium ferrocyanide reacts with ferric ions ofhaemosiderin to form deep blue ferric-ferrocyanide (Fig.\\xa03.20 ).\\nExcessive storage of haemosiderin occurs in situations\\nwhen there is increased break-down of red cells, or systemicoverload of iron due to primary (idiopathic, hereditary)\\nhaemochromatosis, and secondary (acquired) causes such as\\nin thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemia, alcoholic cirrhosis,multiple blood transfusions etc.Accordingly, the effects of haemosiderin excess are as\\nunder ( Fig. 3.21 ):\\na) Localised haemosiderosis.  This develops whenever there\\nis haemorrhage into the tissues. With lysis of red cells,haemoglobin is liberated which is taken up by macrophageswhere it is degraded and stored as haemosiderin. A few\\nexamples are as under :\\nThe changing colours of a bruise or a black eye  are caused\\nby the pigments like biliverdin and bilirubin which are\\nformed during transformation of haemoglobin intohaemosiderin.\\nBrown induration  in the lungs as a result of small haemor-\\nrhages as occur in mitral stenosis and left ventricular failure.Microscopy reveals the presence of ‘heart failure cells’ whichare haemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages.\\nb) Generalised(Systemic or Diffuse) haemosiderosis.\\nSystemic overload with iron may result in generalised\\nhaemosiderosis. There c\\nan be two types of patterns:Figure 3.19 Compound naevus showing clusters of benign naevus cells in the dermis as well as in lower epidermis. These cells contain\\ncoarse, granular, brown-black melanin pigment.\\nFigure 3.20 Haemosiderin pigment in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes\\nseen as Prussian blue granules.\\n42SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nParenchymatous deposition  of haemosiderin  occurs in the\\nparenchymal cells of the liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.\\nReticuloendothelial deposition occurs in the liver, spleen,\\nand bone marrow.\\nGeneralised or systemic overload of iron may occur due\\nto following causes:\\ni) Increased erythropoietic activity:  In various forms of\\nchronic haemolytic anaemia, there is excessive break-down\\nof\\uf020haemoglobin and hence iron overload. The problem is\\nfurther compounded by treating the condition with blood\\ntransfusions (transfusional haemosiderosis)  or by parenteral\\niron therapy. The deposits of iron in these cases, termed asacquired haemosiderosis,  are initially in reticuloendothelial\\ntissues but may secondarily affect other organs.\\nii) Excessive intestinal absorption of iron : A form of\\nhaemosiderosis in which there is excessive intestinal\\nabsorption of iron even when the intake is normal, is knownas idiopathic or hereditary haemochromatosis. It is an autosomal\\ndominant disease associated with much more deposits of ironthan cases of acquired haemosiderosis. \\uf020It is characterised\\nby triad of pigmentary liver cirrhosis, pancreatic damage\\nresulting in diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation. On thebasis of the last two features, the disease has come to betermed as bronze diabetes .\\niii) Excessive dietary intake of iron:  A common example of\\nexcessive intake of iron is Bantu’s disease  in black tribals of\\nSouth Africa who conventionally brew their alcohol in castiron pots that serves as a rich source of additional dietaryiron.\\xa0The excess of iron gets deposited in various organs\\nincluding the liver causing pigment cirrhosis.\\n2. ACID\\xa0HAEMATIN  (HAEMOZOIN).  Acid haematin or\\nhaemozoin is a haemoprotein-derived brown-black pigment\\ncontaining haem iron in ferric form in acidic medium. But itdiffers from haemosiderin because it cannot be stained by\\nPrussian blue (Perl’s) reaction, probably because of formation\\nof complex with a protein so that it is unable to react in thestain. Haematin pigment is seen most commonly in chronic\\nmalaria and in mismatche\\nd blood transfusions. Besides, the\\nmalarial pigment  can also be deposited in macrophages andin the hepatocytes. Another variety of haematin pigment isformalin pigment  formed in blood-rich tissues which have been\\npreserved in acidic formalin solution.\\n3. BILIRUBIN.  Bilirubin is the normal non-iron containing\\npigment present in the bile. It is derived from porphyrin ring\\nof the haem moiety of haemoglobin. Normal level of bilirubinin blood is less than 1 mg/dl. Excess of bilirubin or hyper-bilirubinaemia causes an important clinical condition calledjaundice. Normal bilirubin metabolism and pathogenesis ofjaundice are described in Chapter 21. Hyperbilirubinaemia\\nmay be unconjugated or conjugated, and jaundice may\\nappear in one of the following 3 ways:\\na)Prehepatic or haemolytic,  when there is excessive destruc-\\ntion of red cells.b)Posthepatic or obstructive , which results from obstruction\\nto the outflow of conjugated bilirubin.c)Hepatocellular  that results from failure of hepatocytes to\\nconjugate bilirubin and inability of bilirubin to pass from\\nthe liver to intestine.\\nExcessive accumulation of bilirubin pigment can be seen\\nin different tissues and fluids of the body, especially in thehepatocytes, Kupffer cells and bile sinusoids. Skin and sclerae\\nbecome distinctly yellow. In infants, rise in unconjugated\\nbilirubin may produce toxic brain injury called kernicterus .\\n4.PORPHYRINS.  Porphyrins are normal pigment present\\nin haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochrome. Porphyria\\nrefers to an uncommon disorder of inborn abnormality ofporphyrin metabolism. It results from genetic deficiency ofone of the enzymes required for the synthesis of haem,resulting in excessive production of porphyrins. Often, thegenetic deficiency is precipitated by intake of some drugs.Porphyrias are associated with excretion of intermediateproducts in the urine—delta-aminolaevulinic acid, porpho-bilinogen, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphy-rin. Porphyrias are broadly of 2 types—erythropoietic and\\nhepatic.\\n(a) Erythropoietic porphyrias.  These have defective\\nsynthesis of haem in the red cell precursors in the bone\\nmarrow. These may be further of 2 subtypes:\\nCongenital erythropoietic porphyria , in which the urine is\\nred due to the presence of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin.The skin of these infants is highly photosensitive. Bones andskin show red brown discolouration.\\nErythropoietic protoporphyria , in which there is excess of\\nprotoporphyrin but no excess of porphyrin in the urine.\\n(b) Hepatic\\xa0porphyrias.  These are more common and have\\na normal erythroid precursors but have  a defect in synthesis\\nof haem in the liver. Its further subtypes include thefollowing:\\nAcute intermittent porphyria  is characterised by acute\\nepisodes of 3 patterns: abdominal, neurological, and psycho-tic. These patients do not have photosensitivity. There isexcessive delta aminolaevulinic acid and porphobilinogenin the urine.\\nPorphyria cutanea tarda is the most common of all\\nporphyrias. Porphyrins collect in the liver and small quantityis excreted in the urine. Skin lesions are similar to those inFigure 3.21 Effects of haemosiderosis.\\n43CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptationsvariegate porphyria. Most of the patients have associated\\nhaemosiderosis with cirrhosis which may eventually developinto hepatocellular carcinoma.\\n\\uf020 \\uf020\\uf020 \\uf020\\uf020Mixed (Variegate) porphyrias . It is rare and combines\\nskin photosensitivity with acute abdominal and neurological\\nmanifestations.\\nLipofuscin (Wear and  Tear Pigment)\\nLipofuscin or lipochrome is yellowish-brown intracellular\\nlipid pigment ( lipo = fat, fuscus  = brown). The pigment is\\noften found in atrophied cells of old age and hence the name‘wear and tear pigment’. It is seen in the myocardial fibres,hepatocytes, Leydig cells of the testes and in neurons in seniledementia. However, the pigment may, at times, accumulaterapidly in different cells in wasting diseases unrelated toaging.\\nBy light microscopy,  the pigment is coarse, golden-brown\\ngranular and often accumulates in the central part of thecells around the nuclei. In the heart muscle, the change isassociated with wasting of the muscle and is commonlyreferred to as ‘brown atrophy’ ( Fig.\\xa03.22). The pigment\\ncan be stained by fat stains but differs from other lipids inbeing fluorescent and having acid-fastness.\\nBy electron microscopy, lipofuscin appears as intralysoso-\\nmal electron-dense granules in perinuclear location. Thesegranules are composed of lipid-protein complexes.Lipofuscin represents the collection of indigestible materialin the lysosomes after intracellular lipid peroxidation and is\\ntherefore an example of residual bodies. Unlike in normal\\ncells, in aging or debilitating diseases the phospholipid end-products of membrane damage mediated by oxygen freeradicals fail to get eliminated and hence are deposited aslipofuscin pigment .\\nB. EXOGENOUS PIGMENTS\\nExogenous pigments  are the pigments introduced into the body\\nfrom outside such as by inhalation, ingestion or inoculation.Inhaled Pigment s\\nThe lungs of most individuals, especially of those living in\\nurban areas due to atmospheric pollutants and of smokers,show a large number of inhaled pigmented materials. Themost commonly inhaled substances are carbon or coal dust;others are silica or stone dust, iron or iron oxide, asbestosand various other organic substances. These substances mayproduce occupational lung diseases called pneumoconiosis(Chapter 17). The pigment particles after inhalation are takenup by alveolar macrophages. Some of the pigment-ladenmacrophages are coughed out via bronchi, while some settlein the interstitial tissue of the lung and in the respiratorybronchioles and pass into lymphatics to be deposited in thehilar lymph nodes. Anthracosis  (i.e. deposition of carbon\\nparticles) is seen in almost every adult lung and generallyprovokes no reaction of tissue injury ( Fig.\\xa03.23).\\xa0However,\\nextensive deposition of particulate material over many yearsin coal-miners’ pneumoconiosis, silicosis, asbestosis etc.provoke low grade inflammation, fibrosis and impairedrespiratory function.\\nIngested Pigment s\\nChronic ingestion of certain metals may produce\\npigmentation. The examples are as under:i)Argyria  is chronic ingestion of silver compounds and\\nresults in brownish pigmentation in the skin, bowel, andkidney.ii)Chronic lead poisoning  may produce the characteristic blue\\nlines on teeth at the gumline.iii) Melanosis coli  results from prolonged ingestion of certain\\ncathartics.iv) Carotenaemia  is yellowish-red colouration of the skin\\ncaused by excessive ingestion of carrots which containcarotene.\\nInjected Pigment s (Tattooing)\\nPigments like India ink, cinnabar and carbon are introduced\\ninto the dermis in the process of tattooing where the pigment\\nFigure 3.22 Brown atrophy of the heart. The lipofuscin pigment granules are seen in the cytoplasm of the myocardial fibres, especially arou nd\\nthe nuclei.\\n44SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nis taken up by macrophages and lies permanently in the\\nconnective tissue. The examples of injected pigments areprolonged use of ointments containing mercury, dirt leftaccidentally in a wound, and tattooing by pricking the skinwith dyes.\\nMORPHOLOGY OF IRREVERSIBLE\\nCELL INJURY (CELL DEATH)\\nCell death is a state of irreversible injury. It may occur in theliving body as a local or focal change (i.e. autolysis, necrosisand apoptosis) and the changes that follow it (i.e. gangreneand pathologic calcification), or result in end of the life(somatic death). These pathologic processes involved in celldeath are described below.\\nAUTOLYSIS\\nAutolysis (i.e. self-digestion ) is disintegration of the cell by its\\nown hydrolytic enzymes liberated from lysosomes. Autolysis\\ncan occur in the living body when it is surrounded byinflammatory reaction (vital reaction) , but the term is generally\\nused for postmortem change in which there is completeabsence of surrounding inflammatory response. Autolysisis rapid in some tissues rich in hydrolytic enzymes such as in\\nthe pancreas, and gastric mucosa; intermediate in tissues like\\nthe heart, liver and kidney; and slow  in fibrous tissue.\\nMorphologically, autolysis is identified by homogeneous and\\neosinophilic cytoplasm with loss of cellular details and\\nremains of cell as debris.\\nNECROSIS\\nNecrosis is defined as a localised area of death of tissue\\nfollowed by degradation of tissue by hydrolytic enzymes\\nliberated from dead cells; it is invariably accompanied by\\ninflammatory reaction.\\nNecrosis can be caused by various agents such as\\nhypoxia, chemical and physical agents, microbial agents,immunological injury, etc. Two essential changes characterise\\nirreversible cell injury in necrosis of al l types ( Fig.\\xa03.24,A ):\\ni)Cell digestion by lytic enzymes.  Morphologically this\\nchange is identified as homogeneous and intenselyFigure 3.23 Anthracosis lung. There is presence of abundant coarse black carbon pigment in the septal walls and around the bronchiole.\\nFigure 3.24 Necrosis and apoptosis. A, Cell necrosis is identified\\nby homogeneous, eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclear changes of\\npyknosis, karyolysis, and karyorrhexis.

These\\nnuclear changes may include: condensation of nuclearchromatin (pyknosis)  which may either undergo dissolution\\n(karyolysis)  or fragmentation into many granular clumps\\n(karyorrhexis)  (see Fig. 3.7).\\nTypes of Necrosis\\nMorphologically, there are five types of necrosis: coagulative,\\nliquefaction (colliquative), caseous, fat, and fibrinoid necrosis.\\n1.\\xa0COAGULATIVE\\xa0NECROSIS.  This is the most common\\ntype of necrosis caused by irreversible focal injury, mostly\\nfrom sudden cessation of blood flow (ischaemia), and lessoften from bacterial and chemical agents. The organscommonly affected are the heart, kidney, and spleen.\\nGrossly,  foci of coagulative necrosis in the early stage are\\npale, firm, and slightly swollen. With progression, theybecome more yellowish, softer, and shrunken.Microscopically,  the hallmark of coagulative necrosis is\\nthe conversion of normal cells into their ‘tombstones’ i.e.outlines of the cells are retained so that the cell type canstill be recognised but their cytoplasmic and nucleardetails are lost. The necrosed cells are swollen and appearmore eosinophilic than the normal, along with nuclearchanges described above. But cell digestion and lique-faction fail to occur ( c.f. liquefaction necrosis). Eventually,\\nthe necrosed focus is infiltrated by inflammatory cells andthe dead cells are phagocytosed leaving granular debrisand fragments of cells (Fig.\\xa0 3.25) .\\n2. LIQUEFACTION (COLLIQUATIVE) NECROSIS.  Lique-\\nfaction or colliquative necrosis occurs commonly due toischaemic injury and bacterial or fungal infections. It occursdue to degradation of tissue by the action of powerful\\nFigure 3.25 Coagulative necrosis in infarct kidney. The affected area on right shows cells with intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm of tubular  cells\\nbut the outlines of tubules are still maintained. The nuclei show granular debris. The interface between viable and non-viable area shows non-\\nspecific chronic inflammation and proliferating vessels.hydrolytic enzymes. The common examples are infarct brainand abscess cavity.\\nGrossly,  the affected area is soft with liquefied centre\\ncontaining necrotic debris. Later, a cyst wall is formed.\\nMicroscopically,  the cystic space contains necrotic cell\\ndebris and macrophages filled with phagocytosed\\nmaterial. The cyst wall is formed by proliferatingcapillaries, inflammatory cells, and gliosis (proliferatingglial cells) in the case of brain and proliferating fibroblastsin the case of abscess cavity (Fig. 3.26) .\\n3. CASEOUS NECROSIS.  Caseous necrosis is found in the\\ncentre of foci of tuberculous infections. It combines features\\nof both coagulative and liquefactive necrosis.\\nGrossly,  foci of caseous necrosis, as the name implies,\\nresemble dry cheese and are soft, granular and yellowish.\\nThis appearance is partly attributed to the histotoxic\\neffects of lipopolysaccharides present in the capsule of thetubercle bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis .\\nMicroscopically,  the necrosed foci are structureless,\\neosinophilic, and contain granular debris (Fig.\\xa03.27) . The\\nsurrounding tissue shows characteristic granulomatous\\ninflammatory reaction consisting of epithelioid cells with\\ninterspersed giant cells of Langhans’ or foreign body typeand peripheral mantle of lymphocytes.\\n4. FAT NECROSIS.  Fat necrosis is a special form of cell death\\noccurring at two anatomically different locations but\\nmorphologically similar lesions. These are: following acute\\npancreatic necrosis,  and traumatic fat necrosis commonly in\\nbreasts.\\nIn the case of pancreas, there is liberation of pancreatic\\nlipases from injured or inflamed tissue that results in necrosisof the pancreas as well as of the fat depots throughout theperitoneal cavity, and sometimes, even affecting the extra-abdominal adipose tissue.\\n46SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nFat necrosis hydrolyses neutral fat present in adipose cells\\ninto glycerol and free fatty acids. The damaged adipose cells\\nassume cloudy appearance. The leaked out free fatty acidscomplex with calcium to form calcium soaps (saponification)discussed later under dystrophic calcification.\\nGrossly,  fat necrosis appears as yellowish-white and firm\\ndeposits. Formation of calcium soaps imparts the necrosedfoci firmer and chalky white appearance.\\nMicroscopically,  the necrosed fat cells have cloudy\\nappearance and are surrounded by an inflammatory\\nreaction. Formation of calcium soaps is identified in thetissue sections as amorphous, granular and basophilicmaterial  (Fig.\\xa03.28) .\\n5.\\xa0 FIBRINOID\\xa0 NECROSIS.  Fibrinoid necrosis is\\ncharacterised by deposition of fibrin-like material whichhas the staining properties of fibrin. It is encountered invarious examples of immunologic tissue injury (e.g. inimmune complex vasculitis, autoimmune diseases,Arthus reaction etc), arterioles in hypertension, pepticulcer etc.\\nMicroscopically,  fibrinoid necrosis is identified by\\nbrightly eosinophilic, hyaline-like deposition in the vesselwall. Necrotic focus is surrounded by nuclear debris ofneutrophils (leucocytoclasis) (Fig.\\xa03.29) . Local haemor-\\nrhage may occur due to rupture of the blood vessel.\\nAPOPTOSIS\\nApoptosis is a form of ‘coordinated and internally\\nprogrammed cell death’ having significance in a variety of\\nphysiologic and pathologic conditions ( apoptosis  is a GreekFigure 3.26 Liquefactive necrosis brain.

The term was\\nfirst introduced in 1972 as distinct from necrosis by being aform of cell death which is controlled and regulated by the\\nrate of cell division; when the cell is not needed, pathway of\\ncell death is activated (‘cell suicide’) and is unaccompaniedby any inflammation and collateral tissue damage.\\nAPOPTOSIS\\xa0IN\\xa0BIOLOGIC\\xa0PROCESSES. \\uf020 \\uf020\\uf020 \\uf020\\uf020Apoptosis is\\nresponsible for mediating cell death in a wide variety of\\nphysiologic and pathologic processes as under:\\nPhysiologic Processes:\\n1.Organised cell destruction in sculpting of tissues during\\ndevelopment of embryo .\\n2. Physiologic involution of cells in  hormone-dependent tissues\\ne.g. endometrial shedding, regression of lactating breast after\\nwithdrawal of breast-feeding.\\n3. Normal cell destruction followed by replacement\\nproliferation  such as in intestinal epithelium.\\n4.Involution of the thymus  in early age.\\nPathologic Processes:\\n1. Cell death in tumours exposed to chemotherapeutic agents .\\n2.Cell death by cytotoxic T cells  in immune mechanisms such\\nas in graft-versus-host disease and rejection reactions.\\n3. Progressive depletion of CD4+T cells  in the pathogenesis\\nof AIDS.\\n4.Cell death in viral infections  e.g. formation of Councilman\\nbodies in viral hepatitis.\\n5.Pathologic atrophy  of organs and tissues on withdrawal of\\nstimuli e.g. prostatic atrophy after orchiectomy, atrophy of\\nkidney or salivary gland on obstruction of ureter or ducts,\\nrespectively.\\n6.\\nCell death in response to injurious agents  involved in\\ncausation of necrosis e.g. radiation, hypoxia and mild thermal\\ninjury.\\n7. In degenerative diseases  of CNS  e.g. in Alzheimer’s disease,\\nParkinson’s disease, and chronic infective dementias.8. Heart diseases  e.g. heart failure, acute myocardial infarction\\n(20% necrosis and 80% apoptosis).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The characteristic\\nmorphologic changes in apoptosis seen in histologic and\\nelectron microscopic examination are as under (see\\nFig. 3.24,B):\\n1. Involvement of single cells or  small clusters of cells in\\nthe background of viable cells.2.The apoptotic cells are round to oval shrunken masses\\nof intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm (mummified cell)\\ncontaining shrunken or almost-normal organelles(Fig.\\xa03.30) .Figure 3.28 Fat necrosis in acute pancreatitis.

Characteristically, unlike necrosis, there is no acute\\ninflammatory reaction  around apoptosis.\\n7. Phagocytosis  of apoptotic bodies by macrophages takes\\nplace at varying speed. There may be swift phagocytosis,\\nor loosely floating apoptotic cells after losing contact, with\\neach other and basement membrane as single cells, or may\\nresult in major cell loss in the tissue without significantchange in the overall tissue structure.\\nTechniques to identify and count apoptotic cells.  In addition\\nto routine H & E stain, apoptotic cells can be identified andcounted by following methods:\\n1. Staining of chromatin condensation (haematoxylin,\\nFeulgen, acridine orange).\\n2. Flow cytometry to visualise rapid cell shrinkage.\\n3. DNA changes detected by in situ techniques or by gel\\nelectrophoresis.4. Annexin V as marker for apoptotic cell membrane havingphosphatidylserine on the cell exterior.\\nBIOCHEMICAL CHANGES.  Biochemical processes\\nunderlying the morphologic changes are as under:\\n1. Proteolysis of cytoskeletal proteins.\\n2. Protein-protein cross linking.\\n3. Fragmentation of nuclear chromatin by activation of\\nnuclease.\\n4. Appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer surfaceof cell membrane.\\n5. In some forms of apoptosis, appearance of an adhesive\\nglycoprotein thrombospondin on the outer surface of\\napoptotic bodies.6. Appearance of phosphatidylserine and thrombospondin\\non the outer surface of apoptotic cell facilitates earlyrecognition by macrophages for phagocytosis prior to\\nappearance of inflammatory cells.\\nThe contrasting features of apoptosis and necrosis are\\nillustrated in Fig. 3.24 and summarised in Table\\xa0 3.4.\\nMOLECULAR MECHANISMS OFAPOPTOSIS. \\uf020\\n\\uf020\\uf020 \\uf020\\uf020Several\\nphysiologic and pathologic processes activate apoptosis in a\\nvariety of ways. However, in general the following eventssum up the sequence involved in apoptosis:\\n1. Initiators\\xa0of\\xa0apoptosis.\\xa0 Triggers for signalling program-\\nmed cell death act at the cell membrane, either intra-\\ncellularly or extracellularly. These include the following:\\ni)Withdrawal of signals required for normal cell survival\\n(e.g. absence of certain hormones, growth factors, cytokines).ii) Extracellular signals triggering of programmed cell death(e.g. activation of FAS receptor belonging to TNF-R family).iii) Intracellular stimuli e.g. heat, radiation, hypoxia etc.\\n2.\\nProcess of programmed cell death. After the cell has\\x02 been\\ninitiated\\x02 into self-destruct mode, the programme inbuilt in\\nthe cell gets activated as under:\\ni)Activation of caspases.  Caspases are  a series of proteolyitc\\nor protein-splitting enzymes which act on nuclear proteins\\nand organelles containing protein components. The term‘caspase’ is derived from: c for cystein protease; asp for\\naspartic acid; and ase is used for naming an enzyme. Caspases\\nget activated either by coming in contact with some etiologicagent of cell injury agent or by unknown mechanism.\\nii) Activation of death receptors . Activated caspases set in\\nactivation of FAS receptor (CD 95), a cell surface receptor\\npresent on cytotoxic (CD 8+) T cells, belonging to the family\\nof tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNF-R). FAS receptor isappropriately called a death receptor because on coming incontact with the specific binding site on the target cell, itactivates specific growth controlling genes, BCL-2  and p53.\\niii)Activation of growth controlling genes (BCL-2 and p53) . BCL-\\n2 gene is a human counterpart of CED-9  (cell death) gene\\nTABLE 3.4: Contrasting Features of Apoptosis and Necrosis.\\nFeature Apoptosis Necrosis\\n1.Definition Programmed and coordinated cell death Cell death along with degradation of tissue\\nby hydrolytic enzymes\\n2.Causative agents Physiologic and pathologic processes Hypoxia, toxins\\n3.Morphology i) No \\nInflammatory reaction i) Inflammatory reaction always present\\nii) Death of single cells ii) Death of many adjacent cells\\niii) Cell shrinkage iii) Cell swelling initially\\niv) Cytoplasmic blebs on membrane iv) Membrane disruption\\nv) Apoptotic bodies v) Damaged organelles\\nvi) Chromatin condensation vi) Nuclear disruption\\nvii) Phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies by macrophages vii) Phagocytosis of cell debris by macrophages\\n4.Molecular changes i) Lysosomes and other organelles intact i) Lysosomal breakdown with liberation of\\nii) Genetic activation by proto-oncogenes hydrolytic enzymes\\nand oncosuppressor genes, and cytotoxic ii) Cell death by ATP depletion, membrane\\nT cell-mediated target cell killing damage, free radical injury\\niii)Initiation of apoptosis by intra- and extracellular\\nstimuli, followed by activation of caspase pathway\\n(FAS-R, BCL-2, p53)\\uf075\\uf07549CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptationsfound in programmed cell death of nematode worm\\nCaenorabditis elegans . BCL-2 gene family  is located in the outer\\nmitochondrial membrane and includes both activators andinhibitors of apoptosis. Thus, it may regulate the apoptoticprocess by binding to some related proteins (e.g. to BAX and\\nBAD ) for promoting apoptosis, or to BCL-XL for inhibiting\\napoptosis. The net effect on the mitochondrial membrane isthus based on the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic actionsof BCL-2 gene family.\\nBesides BCL-2, the apoptotic pathway is partly also\\ngoverned by p53 molecule which promotes apoptosis.\\niv)Cell death. The above mechanisms lead to proteolytic\\nactions on nucleus, chromatin clumping, cytoskeletal\\ndamage, disruption of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrialdamage, and disturbed cell membrane.\\n3. Phagocytosis.  The dead apoptotic cells develop\\nmembrane changes which promote their phagocytosis.\\nPhosphatidylserine and thrombospondin molecules whichare normally present on the inside of the cell membrane,appear on the outer surface of the cells in apoptosis, whichfacilitate their identification by adjacent phagocytes andpromotes phagocytosis. The phagocytosis is unaccompaniedby any other inflammatory cells.\\nThe mechanism of apoptosis is schematically represented\\nin Fig.\\xa03.31 .\\nGANGRENE\\nGangrene is a form of ne crosis of tissue with superadded\\nputrefaction. The type of necrosis is usually coagulative due\\nto ischaemia (e.g. in gangrene of the bowel, gangrene of limb).On the other hand, gangrenous or necrotising inflammation  is\\ncharacterised by primarily inflammation provoked byvirulent bacteria resulting in massive tissue necrosis. Thus,the end-result of necrotising inflammation and gangrene isthe same but the way the two are produced, is different. Theexamples of necrotising inflammation are: gangrenousappendicitis, gangrenous stomatitis (noma, cancrum oris).\\nThere are 2 main forms of gangrene—dry and wet, and a\\nvariant form of wet gangrene called gas gangrene. In all typesof gangrene, necrosis undergoes liquefaction by the actionof putrefactive bacteria.\\nDry Gangrene\\nThis form of gangrene begins in the distal part of a limb due\\nto ischaemia. The typical example is the dry gangrene in thetoes and feet of an old patient due to arteriosclerosis. Othercauses of dry gangrene foot include thromboangiitisobliterans (Buerger’s disease), Raynaud’s disease, trauma,ergot poisoning. It is usually initiated in one of the toes whichis farthest from the blood supply, containing so little bloodthat even the invading bacteria find it hard to grow in thenecrosed tissue. The gangrene spreads slowly upwards untilit reaches a point where the blood supply is adequate to keepthe tissue viable. A line of separation  is formed at this point\\nbetween the gangrenous part and the viable part.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. \\xa0Grossly ,\\xa0the affected part\\nis dry, shrunken and dark black, resembling the foot of amummy. It is black due to liberation of haemoglobin fromhaemolysed red blood cells which is acted upon byhydrogen disulfide (H\\n2S) produced by bacteria resulting\\nin formation of black iron sulfide. The line of separationusually brings about complete separation with eventualfalling off of the gangrenous tissue if it is not removedsurgically ( Fig.\\xa03.32 ).\\nFigure 3.31 Molecular mechanism of apoptosis.\\n50SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nHistologically , there is necrosis with smudging of the\\ntissue. The line of separation consists of inflammatory\\ngranulation tissue (Fig. 3.33) .\\nWet Gangrene\\nWet gangrene occurs in naturally moist tissues and organs\\nsuch as the mouth, bowel, lung, cervix, vulva etc. Diabeticfoot is another example of wet gangrene due to high sugarcontent in the necrosed tissue which favours growth ofbacteria. Bed sores  occurring in a bed-ridden patient due to\\npressure on sites like the sacrum, buttocks and heels are theother important clinical conditions included in wet gangrene.Wet gangrene usually develops rapidly due to blockage ofvenous, and less commonly, arterial blood flow fromthrombosis or embolism. The affected part is stuffed withblood which favours the rapid growth of putrefactivebacteria. The toxic products formed by bacteria are absorbedcausing profound systemic manifestations of septicaemia,and finally death. The spreading wet gangrene generallylacks clear-cut line of demarcation and may spread toperitoneal cavity causing peritonitis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the affected part\\nis soft, swollen, putrid, rotten and dark. The classicexample is gangrene of bowel, commonly due to\\nstrangulated hernia, volvulus or intussusception. The partis stained dark due to the same mechanism as in drygangrene (Fig. 3.34) .\\nHistologically,  there is coagulative necrosis with stuffing\\nof affected part with blood. There is ulceration of themucosa and intense inflammatory infiltration. Lumen ofthe bowel contains mucus and blood. The line ofdemarcation between gangrenous segment and viablebowel is generally not clear-cut (Fig. 3.35) .\\nContrasting features of two main forms of gangrene are\\nsummarised in Table\\xa03.5.\\nGAS\\xa0 GANGRENE.  It is a special form of wet gangrene\\ncaused by gas-forming clostridia (gram-positive anaerobic\\nbacteria) which gain entry into the tissues through opencontaminated wounds, especially in the muscles, or as acomplication of operation on colon which normally containsclostridia. Clostridia produce various toxins which producenecrosis and oedema locally and are also absorbed producingprofound systemic manifestations.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. \\xa0Grossly,  the affected area\\nis swollen, oedematous, painful and crepitant due toaccumulation of gas bubbles within the tissues.Figure 3.32 Dry gangrene of the foot. The gangrenous area is dry, shrunken and dark and is separated from the viable tissue by clear line of\\nseparation.\\nFigure 3.33 Dry gangrene of the foot. Microscopy shows coagulative\\nnecrosis of the skin, muscle and other soft tissue, and thrombsed vessels.\\n51CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations\\nSubsequently, the affected tissue becomes dark black and\\nfoul smelling.\\nMicroscopically,  the muscle fibres undergo coagulative\\nnecrosis with liquefaction. Large number of gram-positive\\nbacilli can be identified. At the periphery, a zone ofleucocytic infiltration, oedema and congestion are found.Capillary and venous thrombi are common.\\nPATHOLOGIC CALCIFICATION\\nDeposition of calcium salts in tissues other than osteoid or\\nenamel is called pathologic or heterotopic calcification. Twodistinct types of pathologic calcification are recognised:\\nDystrophic calcification , which is characterised by\\ndeposition of calcium salts in dead or degenerated tissueswith normal calcium metabolism and normal serum calciumlevels.Metastatic calcification , on the other hand, occurs in\\napparently normal tissues and is associated with derangedcalcium metabolism and hypercalcaemia.\\nEtiology and pathogenesis of the two are different but\\nmorphologically the deposits in both resemble normalminerals of the bone.\\nHistologically,  in routine H and E stained sections,\\ncalcium salts appear as deeply basophilic, irregular andgranular clumps. The deposits may be intracellular,extracellular, or at both locations. Occasionally, hetero-topic bone formation (ossification) may occur. Calciumdeposits can be confirmed by special stains like silverimpregnation method of von-Kossa  producing black colour,\\nand alizarin red S  that produces red staining. Pathologic\\ncalcification is often accompanied by diffuse or granulardeposits of iron giving positive Prussian blue reaction inPerl’s stain.Figure 3.34 Wet gangrene of the small bowel. The affected part is\\nsoft, swollen and dark.

As apparent from\\ndefinition, dystrophic calcification may occur due to 2 types\\nof causes:\\nCalcification in dead tissue\\nCalcification of degenerated tissue.\\nCalcification\\xa0in\\xa0dead\\xa0tissue1.Caseous necrosis  in tuberculosis is the most common site\\nfor dystrophic calcification. Living bacilli may be presenteven in calcified tuberculous lesions, lymph nodes, lungs,etc (Fig.\\xa03.36) .\\n2.Liquefaction necrosis  in chronic abscesses may get calcified.\\n3.Fat necrosis  following acute pancreatitis or traumatic fat\\nnecrosis in the breast results in deposition of calcium soaps.\\n4.Gamna-Gandy bodies  in chronic venous congestion (CVC)\\nof the spleen is characterised by calcific deposits admixed\\nwith haemosiderin  on fibrous tissue.\\n5.Infarcts may sometimes undergo dystrophic calcification.\\n6.Thrombi,  especially in the veins, may produce phleboliths.\\n7.Haematomas  in the vicinity of bones may undergo\\ndystrophic calcification.8.Dead parasites  like in hydatid cyst, Schistosoma eggs, and\\ncysticercosis are some of the examples showing dystrophic\\ncalcification.\\n9.Calcification in breast cancer detected by mammography.\\n10.Congenital toxoplasmosis involving the central nervous\\nsystem visualised by calcification in the infant brain.\\nCalcification\\xa0in\\xa0degenerated\\xa0tissues\\n1.Dense old scars  may undergo hyaline degeneration and\\nsubsequent calcification.\\n2.Atheromas  in the aorta and coronaries frequently undergo\\ncalcification.\\n3.Mönckeberg’s sclerosis  shows calcification in the tunicamedia of muscular arteries in elderly people (Chapter 15)\\n(Fig.3.37) .\\n4.Stroma of tumours  such as uterine fibroids, breast cancer,\\nthyroid adenoma, goitre etc show calcification.\\n5.\\nSome tumours show characteristic spherules of calci-\\nfication called psammoma bodies  or calcospherites such as in\\nmeningioma, papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the\\novary and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.\\n6.Cysts  which have been present for a long time may show\\ncalcification of their walls e.g. epidermal and pilar cysts.\\n7.Calcinosis cutis  is a condition of unknown cause in which\\nthere are irregular nodular deposits of calcium salts in the\\nskin and subcutaneous tissue.\\n8.Senile degenerative changes  may be accompanied by\\ndystrophic calcification such as in costal cartilages, tracheal\\nor bronchial cartilages, and pineal gland in the brain etc.Figure 3.35 Wet gangrene of the small bowel. Microscopy shows coagulative necrosis of the affected bowel wall and thrombosed vessels\\nwhile the junction with normal intestine is indistinct and shows an inflammatory infiltrate.\\nFigure 3.36 Dystrophic calcification in caseous necrosis in\\ntuberculous lymph node. In H & E, the deposits are basophilic granular\\nwhile the periphery shows healed granulomas.\\n53CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations\\nPathogenesis of dystrophic calcification.  It is not quite clear\\nas to how dystrophic calcification takes place. Since serum\\ncalcium levels are within normal limits, the denatured\\nproteins in necrotic or degenerated tissue bind phosphate\\nions, which react with calcium ions to form precipitates of\\ncalcium phosphate.\\nThe process of dystrophic calcification has been likened\\nto the formation of normal hydroxyapatite in the bone\\ninvolving 2 phases: initiation and propagation.\\nInitiation  is the phase in which precipitates of calcium\\nphosphate begin to accumulate intracellularly in themitochondria, or extracellularly in membrane-bound\\nvesicles.\\nPropagation  is the phase in which minerals deposited in\\nthe initiation phase are propagated to form mineral crystals.\\nMETASTATIC CALCIFICATION.  Since metastatic calcifi-\\ncation occurs in normal tissues due to hypercalcaemia, its\\ncauses would include one of the following two conditions:\\nExcessive mobilisation of calcium from the bone.\\nExcessive absorption of calcium from the gut.\\nExcessive mobilisation of calcium from the bone.  These\\ncauses are more common and include the following:\\n1.Hyperparathyroidism  which may be primary such as due\\nto parathyroid adenoma, or secondary such as from\\nparathyroid hyperplasia, chronic renal failure etc.\\n2.Bony destructive  lesions  such as multiple myeloma,\\nmetastatic carcinoma.3.Prolonged immobilisation  of a patient results in disuse\\natrophy of the bones and hypercalcaemia.\\nExcessive\\xa0 absorption\\xa0of\\xa0calcium\\xa0from\\xa0the\\xa0\\ngut. Less often,\\nexcess calcium may be absorbed from the gut causing\\nhypercalcaemia and metastatic calcification. These causes are\\nas under:\\n1.Hypervitaminosis D  results in increased calcium\\nabsorption.2.Milk-alkali syndrome  caused by excessive oral intake of\\ncalcium in the form of milk and administration of calcium\\ncarbonate in the treatment of peptic ulcer.\\n3.Hypercalcaemia of infancy  is another condition in which\\nmetastatic calcification may occur.\\nSites of metastatic calcification.  Metastatic calcification may\\noccur in any normal tissue of the body but affects the\\nfollowing organs more commonly:1. Kidneys , especially at the basement membrane of tubular\\nepithelium and in the tubular lumina causing nephro-calcinosis (Fig.3.38) .\\n2. Lungs , especially in the alveolar walls.\\n3. Stomach , on the acid-secreting fundal glands.\\n4. Blood vessels , especially on the internal elastic lamina.\\n5. Cornea  is another site affected by metastatic calcification.\\n6. Synovium of the joint causing pain and dysfunction.\\nPathogenesis of metastatic calcification.  Metasatic\\ncalcification at the above-mentioned sites occurs due toexcessive binding of inorganic phosphate ions with calcium\\nions, which are elevated due to underlying metabolic\\nderangement. This leads to formation of precipitates ofcalcium phosphate at the preferential sites. Metastaticcalcification is reversible upon correction of underlyingmetabolic disorder.\\nThe distinguishing features between the two types of\\npathologic calcification are summarised in\\x02Table 3.6 .\\nCELLULAR ADAPTATIONS\\nFor the sake of survival on exposure to stress, the cells make\\nadjustments with the changes in their environment (i.e.adapt) to the physiologic needs (physiologic adaptation)  and\\nto non-lethal pathologic injury (pathologic adaptation) . Broadly\\nspeaking, such physiologic and pathologic adaptations occurby following processes (Fig. 3.39):\\nDecreasing or increasing their size i.e. atrophy  and\\nhypertrophy  respectively, or by increasing their number i.e.Figure 3.37 Dystrophic calcification in degenerated tunica media\\nof muscular artery of uterine myometrium in Mönckeberg’s arterio-\\nsclerosis.Figure 3.38 Metastatic calcification in tubular basement membrane\\nin nephrocalcinosis due to hypercalcaemia.\\n54SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nhyperplasia ( postfix word -trophy  means nourishment; -plasia\\nmeans growth of new cells).\\nChanging the pathway of phenotypic differentiation of\\ncells i.e. metaplasia  and dysplasia (prefix word meta-  means\\ntransformation; dys- means bad development).\\nIn general, the adaptive responses are reversible on withdrawal\\nof stimulus. However, if the irritant stimulus persists for long\\ntime, the cell may not be able to survive and may either die\\nor progress further e.g. cell death may occur in sustainedatrophy; dysplasia may progress into carcinoma in situ . Thus,the concept of evolution ‘survival of the fittest’ holds true\\nfor adaptation as ‘survival of the adaptable’ .\\nVarious mechanisms which may be involved in adaptive\\ncellular responses include the following:\\nAltered cell surface receptor binding.\\nAlterations in signal for protein synthesis.\\nSynthesis of new proteins by the target cell such as heat-\\nshock proteins (HSPs).\\nCommon forms of cellular adaptive responses along with\\nexamples of physiologic and pathologic adaptations are\\nbriefly discussed below (Fig.\\xa03.39) .\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 3.6: Differences between Dystrophic and Metastatic Calcification.\\nFeature Dystrophic Calcification Metastatic Calcification\\n1.Definition Deposits of calcium salts in dead and Deposits of calcium salts in normal tissues\\ndegenerated tissues\\n2.Calcium metabolism Normal Deranged\\n3.Serum calcium level Normal Hypercalcaemia\\n4.Reversibility Generally irreversible Reversible upon correction of metabolic disorder\\n5.Causes Necrosis (caseous, liquefactive, fat), Hyperparathyroidism (due to adenoma,\\ninfarcts, thrombi, haematomas, \\ndead hyperplasia, CRF), bony destructive lesions\\nparasites, old scars, atheromas, (e.g. myeloma, metastatic carcinoma),\\nMönckeberg’s sclerosis, certain prolonged immobilisation, hypervitaminosis D,\\ntumours, cysts, calcinosis cutis milk-alkali syndrome, hypercalcaemia of infancy\\n6.Pathogenesis Increased binding of phosphates with Increased precipitates of calcium phosphate due to\\nnecrotic and degenerative tissue, which hypercalcaemia  at certain sites e.g. in lungs, stomach,\\nin turn binds to calcium forming blood vessels and cornea\\ncalcium phosphate precipitates\\nFigure 3.39 Adaptive disorders of growth.\\n55CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular AdaptationsATROPHY\\nReduction of the number and size of parenchymal cells of an\\norgan or its parts which was once normal is called atrophy(compared from  hypoplasia  which is the term used for\\ndevelopmentally small size, and aplasia  for extreme failure\\nof development so that only rudimentary tissue is present).\\nCAUSES.\\xa0 Atrophy may occur from physiologic or pathologic\\ncauses:A.

For example:i) Atrophy of lymphoid tissue in lymph nodes, appendix\\nand thymus.i\\ni) Atrophy of gonads after menopause.\\niii) Atrophy of brain with aging.\\nB.\\xa0Pathologic\\xa0atrophy.  The causes are as under:\\n1.Starvation atrophy.  In starvation, there is first depletion\\nof carbohydrate and fat stores followed by protein\\ncatabolism. There is general weakness, emaciation andanaemia referred to as cachexia seen in cancer and severelyill patients.\\n2.Ischaemic atrophy.  Gradual diminution of blood supply\\ndue to atherosclerosis may result in shrinkage of the affected\\norgan e.g.i) Small atrophic kidney in atherosclerosis of renal artery.ii) Atrophy of brain in cerebral atherosclerosis.\\n3.Disuse atrophy.  Prolonged diminished functional activity\\nis associated with disuse atrophy of the organ e.g.\\ni) Wasting of muscles of limb immobilised in cast.\\nii) Atrophy of .the pancreas in obstruction of pancreatic duct.\\n4.Neuropathic atrophy.  Interruption in nerve supply leads\\nto wasting of muscles e.g.\\ni) Poliomyelitis\\nii) Motor neuron disease\\niii) Nerve section.\\n5.Endocrine atrophy.  Loss of endocrine regulatory\\nmechanism results in reduced metabolic activity of tissues\\nand hence atrophy e.g.i) Hypopituitarism may lead to atrophy of thyroid, adrenal\\nand gonads.\\nii) Hypothyroidism may cause atrophy of the skin and its\\nadnexal structures.\\n6.Pressure atrophy.  Prolonged pressure from benign\\ntumours or cyst or aneurysm may cause compression and\\natrophy of the tissues e.g.\\ni) Erosion of spine by tumour in nerve root.\\nii) Erosion of skull by meningioma arising from pia-arachnoid.\\niii) Erosion of sternum by aneurysm of arch of aorta.\\n7.Idiopathic atrophy.  There are some examples of atrophy\\nwhere no obvious cause is present e.g.\\ni) Myopathies.\\nii) Testicular atrophy.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Irrespective of the\\nunderlying cause for atrophy, the pathologic changes aresimilar. The organ is small, often shrunken. The cells\\nbecome smaller in size but are not dead cells. Shrinkagein cell size is due to reduction in cell organelles, chieflymitochondria, myofilaments and endoplasmic reticulum.There is often increase in the number of autophagic\\nvacuoles containing cell debris (Fig.\\xa03.40) . These\\nautophagic vacuoles may persist to form ‘residual bodies’\\nin the cell cytoplasm e.g. lipofuscin pigment granules inbrown atrophy (page 43).\\nHYPERTROPHY\\nHypertrophy  is an increase in the size of parenchymal cells\\nresulting in enlargement of the organ or tissue, without any\\nchange in the number of cells.\\nCAUSES.  Hypertrophy may be physiologic or pathologic.\\nIn both cases, it is caused either by increased functional\\ndemand or by hormonal stimulation. Hypertrophy withoutaccompanying hyperplasia affects mainly muscles. In non-dividing cells too, only hypertrophy occurs.\\nA.Physiologic\\xa0hypertrophy.  Enlarged size of the uterus in\\npregnancy is an excellent example of physiologic\\nhypertrophy as well as hyperplasia.\\nB.Pathologic\\xa0\\nhypertrophy.  Examples of certain diseases\\nassociated with hypertrophy are as under:\\n1.Hypertrophy of cardiac muscle  may occur in a number of\\ncardiovascular diseases. A few conditions producing left\\nventricular hypertrophy are as under:i) Systemic hypertensionii) Aortic valve disease (stenosis and insufficiency)iii) Mitral insufficiency\\n2.Hypertrophy of smooth muscle e.g.\\ni) Cardiac achalasia (in oesophagus)\\nii) Pyloric stenosis (in stomach)Figure 3.40 Testicular atrophy. The seminiferous tubules show\\nhyalinisation, peritubular fibrosis and diminished number and size of\\nspermatogenic elements. There is prominence of Leydig cells in theinterstitium.\\n56SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\niii) Intestinal strictures\\niv) Muscular arteries in hypertension.\\n3.Hypertrophy of skeletal muscle  e.g. hypertrophied muscles\\nin athletes and manual labourers.\\n4.Compensatory hypertrophy  may occur in an organ when\\nthe contralateral organ is removed e.g.i) Following nephrectomy on one side in a young patient,\\nthere is compensatory hypertrophy as well as hyperplasiaof the nephrons of the other kidney.\\nii) Adrenal hyperplasia following removal of one adrenal\\ngland.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The affected organ is\\nenlarged and heavy. For example, a hypertrophied heartof a patient with systemic hypertension may weigh700-800 g as compared to average normal adult weight of350 g. There is enlargement of muscle fibres as well as ofnuclei (Fig.\\xa03.41) . At ultrastructural level, there is increased\\nsynthesis of DNA and RNA, increased protein synthesisand increased number of organelles like mitochondria,endoplasmic reticulum and myofibrils\\n.\\nHYPERPLASIA\\nHyperplasia is an increase in the number of parenchymal\\ncells resulting in enlargement of the organ or tissue. Quiteoften, both hyperplasia and hypertrophy occur together.Hyperplasia occurs due to increased recruitment of cells fromG\\n0 (resting) phase of the cell cycle to undergo mitosis, when\\nstimulated. All body cells do not possess hyperplastic growthpotential (Chapter 6). Labile cells (e.g. epithelial cells of theskin and mucous membranes, cells of the bone marrow andlymph nodes) and stable cells (e.g. parenchymal cells of theliver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal, and thyroid) can undergohyperplasia, while permanent cells (e.g. neurons, cardiac andskeletal muscle) have little or no capacity for regenerativehyperplastic growth. Neoplasia differs from hyperplasia inhaving hyperplastic growth with loss of growth-regulatorymechanism due to change in genetic composition of the cell.Hyperplasia, on the other hand, persists so long as stimulusis present.\\nCAUSES.  As with other non-neoplastic adaptive disorders\\nof growth, hyperplasia has also been divided into physiologic\\nand pathologic.\\nA.\\xa0Physiologic\\xa0hyperplasia.\\xa0 The two most common types\\nare as follows:\\n1.Hormonal hyperplasia  i.e. hyperplasia occurring under the\\ninfluence of hormonal stimulation e.g.\\ni) Hyperplasia of female breast at puberty, during preg-\\nnancy and lactation.\\nii) Hyperplasia of pregnant uterus.\\niii)Proliferative activity of normal endometrium after a\\nnormal menstrual cycle.iv) Prostatic hyperplasia in old age.\\n2.Compensatory hyperplasia  i.e. hyperplasia occurring\\nfollowing removal of part of an organ or a contralateral organ\\nin paired organ e.g.\\ni) Regeneration of the liver following partial hepatectomy\\nii) Regeneration of epidermis after skin abrasioniii) Following nephrectomy on one side, there is hyperplasia\\nof nephrons of the other kidney.\\nB. Pathologic\\xa0hyperplasia.  Most examples of pathologic\\nhyperplasia are due to excessive stimulation of hormones or\\ngrowth factors e.g.\\ni) Endometrial hyperplasia following oestrogen excess.ii) In wound healing, there is formation of granulation tissue\\ndue to proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells.Figure 3.41 Cardiac hypertrophy. The myocardial muscle fibres are\\nthick with abundance of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei  are also enlarged\\nwith irregular outlines.\\nFigure 3.42 Pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of the skin.  The\\nepidermis shows an increase in the number of layers of the squamousepithelium. The intervening dermal soft tissue shows moderate chronicinflammation.\\n57CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations\\niii) Formation of skin warts from hyperplasia of epidermis\\ndue to human papilloma virus.iv) Pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of the skin.v) Intraductal epithelial hyperplasia in the breast infibrocystic breast disease\\n.\\nPATHOLOGIC FEATURES.  There is enlargement of the\\naffected organ or tissue and increase in the number of cells(Fig.\\xa03.42) . This is due to increased rate of DNA synthesis\\nand hence increased mitoses of the cells.\\nMETAPLASIA\\nMetaplasia is defined as a reversible change of one type of\\nepithelial or mesenchymal adult cells to another type of adult\\nepithelial or mesenchymal cells, usually in response toabnormal stimuli, and often reverts back to normal on removal\\nof stimulus . However, if the stimulus persists for a long time,\\nepithelial metaplasia may transform into cancer (Fig.\\xa0 3.43) .\\nMetaplasia is broadly divided into 2 types: epithelial and\\nmesenchymal.\\nA. EPITHELIAL\\xa0METAPLASIA.  This is the more common\\ntype. The metaplastic change may be patchy or diffuse and\\nusually results in replacement by stronger but less well-specialised epithelium. However, the metaplastic epithelium\\nbeing less well-specialised such as squamous type, results\\nin deprivation of protective mucus secretion and hence moreprone to infection. Depending upon the type epitheliumtransformed, two types of epithelial metaplasia are seensquamous and columnar:\\n1. Squamous\\xa0 metaplasia.  This is more common. Various\\ntypes of specialised epithelium are capable of undergoing\\nsquamous metaplastic change due to chronic irritation thatmay be mechanical, chemical or infective in origin. Somecommon examples of squamous metaplasia are seen at\\nfollowing sites:\\ni\\n) In bronchus  (normally lined by pseudostratified columnar\\nciliated epithelium) in chronic smokers.ii) In uterine endocervix  (normally lined by simple columnar\\nepithelium) in prolapse of the uterus and in old age\\n(Fig.\\xa03.44) .iii) In gallbladder  (normally lined by simple columnar\\nepithelium) in chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.iv) In prostate  (ducts normally lined by simple columnar\\nepithelium) in chronic prostatitis and oestrogen therapy.v) In renal pelvis  and urinary bladder  (normally lined by\\ntransitional epithelium) in chronic infection and stones.vi) In vitamin A deficiency , apart from xerophthalmia, there\\nis squamous metaplasia in the nose, bronchi, urinary tract,lacrimal and salivary glands.\\n2. Columnar\\xa0metaplasia.  There are some conditions in\\nwhich there is transformation to columnar epithelium. For\\nexample:i) Intestinal metaplasia in healed chronic gastric ulcer.ii) Columnar metaplasia in Barrett’s oesophagus, in whichthere is change of normal squamous epithelium to columnarepithelium (Fig.\\xa03.45) .Figure 3.43 Schematic diagram showing sequential changes in uterine cervix from normal epithelium to development of carcinoma in situ .

Part of the oesophagus which is normally lined by squamous\\nepithelium undergoes metaplastic change to columnar epithelium ofintestinal type.\\niii)Conversion of pseudostratified ciliated columnar\\nepithelium in chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis to\\ncolumnar type.iv) In cervical erosion (congenital and adult type), there isvariable area of endocervical glandular mucosa everted intothe vagina.\\nB. MESENCHYMAL METAPLASIA.  Less often, there is\\ntransformation of one adult type of mesenchymal tissue to\\nanother. The examples are as under:\\n1. Osseous\\xa0metaplasia.  Osseous metaplasia is formation of\\nbone in fibrous tissue, cartilage and myxoid tissue. Examples\\nof osseous metaplasia are as under:i) In arterial wall in old age (Mönckeberg’s medial calcificsclerosis)ii) In soft tissues in myositis ossificansiii) In cartilage of larynx and bronchi in elderly peopleiv) In scar of chronic inflammation of prolonged durationv) In the fibrous stroma of tumour (Fig.\\xa03.46) .\\n2. Cartilaginous\\xa0metaplasia.  In healing of fractures,\\ncartilaginous metaplasia may occur where there is unduemobility.\\nDYSPLASIA\\nDysplasia means ‘disordered cellular development’, often\\naccompanied with metaplasia and hyperplasia; it is thereforealso referred to as atypical hyperplasia . Dysplasia occurs most\\noften in epithelial cells. Epithelial dysplasia is characterisedby cellular proliferation and cytologic changes. These changesinclude:\\n1.Increased number of layers of epithelial cells\\n2. Disorderly arrangement of cells from basal layer to thesurface layer3. Loss of basal polarity i.e. nuclei lying away frombasement membrane\\n4. Cellular and nuclear pleomorphism\\n5. Increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio6. Nuclear hyperchromatism7.Increased mitotic activity.\\nThe two most common examples of dysplastic changes\\nare the uterine cervix  (Fig.\\n 3.47)  and respiratory tract .\\nDysplastic changes often occur due to chronic irritation\\nor prolonged inflammation. On removal of the incitingstimulus, the changes may disappear. In a proportion ofcases, however, dysplasia progresses into carcinoma in situ\\n(cancer confined to layers superficial to basement membrane)or invasive cancer.  This concept is further discussed again\\nin details in Chapters 8, 17, and 24.\\nThe differences between dysplasia and metaplasia are\\ncontrasted in \\xa0Table\\xa03.7 .Figure 3.46 Osseous metaplsia in leiomyoma uterus. The whorls\\ncomposed of the smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts show osseous\\nmetaplasia in the centre.\\nFigure 3.47 Uterine cervical dysplasia, high grade lesion. It shows\\nincreased number of layers of squamous epithelium having marked\\ncytologic atypia including mitoses.\\n59CHAPTER 3 Cell Injury and Cellular Adaptations\\nCELLULAR AGING\\nOld a ge is a concept of longevity in human beings. The\\nconsequences of aging appear after reproductive age.\\nHowever, aging is distinct from mortality and diseasealthough aged individuals are more vulnerable to disease.\\nThe average age of death of primitive man was barely\\n20-25 years compared to life-expectancy now which is\\napproaching 80 years, survival being longer in women thanmen (3:2). About a century ago, the main causes of deathwere accidents and infections. But now with greater safetyand sanitation, the mortality in the middle years hassufficiently declined. However, the maximum humanlifespan has remained stable at about 110 years. Higher lifeexpectancy in women is not due to difference in the responseof somatic cells of the two sexes but higher mortality rate inmen is attributed to violent causes and greater susceptibilityto cardiovascular disease, cancer, cirrhosis and respiratorydiseases, for which cigarette smoking and alcoholconsumption are two most important contributory factors.\\nIn general, the life expectancy of an individual depends\\nupon the following factors:1.Intrinsic genetic process i.e. the genes controlling response\\nto endogenous and exogenous factors initiating apoptosis insenility.2.Environmental factors e.g. consumption and inhalation of\\nharmful subs tances, diet, role of antioxidants etc.\\n3.Lifestyle of the individual such as diseases due to alcoholism\\n(e.g. cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma), smoking (e.g.bronchogenic carcinoma and other respiratory diseases),drug addiction.4.Age-related diseases e.g. atherosclerosis and ischaemic\\nheart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis,Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease etc.\\nCELLULAR BASIS\\nWith age, structural and functional changes occur in different\\norgans and systems of the human body. Although nodefinitive biologic basis of aging is established, mostacceptable theory is the functional decline of non-dividingcells such as neurons and myocytes. The followinghypotheses based on investigations explain the cellular basisof aging:\\n1. Experimental\\xa0cellular\\xa0senescence.\\xa0 By in vitro  studies of\\ntissue culture, it has been observed that cultured human\\nfibroblasts replicate for up to 50 population doublings andthen the culture dies out. It means that in vitro  there is reduced\\nfunctional capacity to proliferate with age. Studies haveshown that there is either loss of chromosome 1 or deletionof its long arm (1q). Alternatively it has been observed thatwith every cell division there is progressive shortening oftelomere  present at the tips of chromosomes, which in normal\\ncell is repaired by the presence of RNA enzyme, telomerase .\\nHowever, due to aging, because of inadequate presence oftelomerase enzyme, lost telomere is not repaired resultingin interference in viability of cell (Fig.\\xa0 3.48) .\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 3.7: Differences between Metaplasia and Dysplasia.\\nFeature Metaplasia Dysplasia\\ni) Definition Change of one type of epithelial or mesenchymal Disordered cellular development, may be\\ncell to another type of adult epithelial or mesen- accompanied with \\nhyperplasia or metaplasia\\nchymal cell\\nii) Types Epithelial (squamous, columnar) and Epithelial only\\nmesenchymal (osseous, cartilaginous)\\niii)Tissues affected Most commonly affects bronchial mucosa, uterine Uterine cervix, bronchial mucosa\\nendocervix; others mesenchymal tissues (cartilage,\\narteries)\\niv) Cellular changes Mature cellular development Disordered cellular development (pleomorphism,\\nnuclear hyperchromasia, mitosis, loss of polarity)\\nv) Natural history Reversible on withdrawal of stimulus May regress on removal of  inciting stimulus,\\nor may progress to higher grades of dysplasia\\nor carcinoma in situ\\nFigure 3.48 Telomeres on chromosomes. In aging, these end\\ncomponents of chromosome are progressively shortened.\\n60SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques2. Geneticcontrol in invertebrates. Clock (clk)  genes\\nresponsible for controlling the rate and time of aging have\\nbeen identified in lower invertebrates e.g. clk-1 gene mutation\\nin the metazoa, Caenorhabditis elegans , results in prolonging\\nthe lifespan of the worm and slowing of some metabolicfunctions.\\n3. Diseasesof accelerated aging. Aging under genetic\\ncontrol in human beings is supported by the observation of\\nhigh concordance in lifespan of identical twins. A heritablecondition associated with signs of accelerated aging processis termed progeria and is characterised by baldness, cataracts,\\nand coronary artery disease. Another example is Werner’ssyndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disease, characterisedby similar features of premature aging, atherosclerosis andrisk for development of various cancers.\\n4. Oxidative stress hypothesis (free\\xa0 radical-mediated\\ninjury). Currently, it is believed that aging is partly caused\\nby progressive and reversible molecular oxidative damage\\ndue to persistent oxidative stress on the human cells. Innormal cells, very small amount (3%) of total oxygenconsumption by the cell is converted into reactive oxygenspecies. The rate of generation of reactive oxygen species isdirectly correlated with metabolic rate of the organisms. Withaging, there is low metabolic rate with generation of toxicoxygen radicals, which fail to get eliminated causing theiraccumulation and hence cell damage. The underlyingmechanism appears to be oxidative damage to mitochondria.The role of antioxidant in retarding the oxidant damage hasbeen reported in some studies.\\nORGAN CHANGES IN AGING\\nAlthough all organs start showing deterioration with aging,\\nfollowing organs show evident morphologic and functionalchanges:\\n1. Cardiovascular system:  Atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis with\\ncalcification, Mönckeberg’s medial calcification, brown\\natrophy of heart, loss of elastic tissue from aorta and majorarterial trunks causing their dilatation.\\n2. Nervous system:  Atrophy of gyri and sulci, Alzheimer’s\\ndisease, Parkinson’s disease.3. Musculoskeletal system : Degenerative bone diseases,\\nfrequent fractures due to loss of bone density, age related\\nmuscular degeneration.\\n4. Eyes: Deterioration of vision due to cataract and vascular\\nchanges in retina.5. Hearing: Disability in hearing due to senility is related to\\notosclerosis.6. Immune system:  Reduced IgG response to antigens, frequent\\nand severe infections.\\n7. Skin:  Laxity of skin due to loss of elastic tissue.\\n8. Cancers:  As discussed later in Chapter 8, 80% of cancers\\noccur in the age range of 50 and 80 years.\\n❑61CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis\\nChapter 4Immunopathology\\nIncluding AmyloidosisChapter 4\\nINTRODUCTION\\nImmunity and immunopathology are proverbial two edges\\nof ‘double-edged sword’.\\nBefore discussing immunopathology which is the study\\nof derangements in the immune system, it is important toknow the normal structure and function of the immunesystem (immunophysiology) and to get familiarised with afew terms and definitions commonly used in any descriptionof immunology.\\nAn antigen (Ag)  is defined as a substance, usually protein\\nin nature, which when introduced into the tissues stimulatesantibody production.\\nHapten  is a non-protein substance which has no antigenic\\nproperties, but on combining with a protein can form a newantigen capable of forming antibodies.\\nAn antibody (Ab)  is a protein substance produced as a\\nresult of antigenic stimulation. Circulating antibodies areimmunoglobulins (Igs) of which there are 5 classes: IgG, IgA,IgM, IgE and IgD.\\nAn antigen may induce specifically sensitised cells\\nhaving the capacity to recognise, react and neutralise theinjurious agent or organisms.\\nThe antigen may combine with antibody to form antigen-\\nantibody complex . The reaction of Ag with Ab in vitro  may\\nbe primary  or secondary phenomena ; the secondary reaction\\ninduces a number of processes. In vivo, the Ag-Ab reaction\\nmay cause tissue damage (Fig. 4.1).\\nTYPES OF IMMUNITY.  Broadly speaking, immunity or\\nbody defense mechanism is divided into 2 types, each withhumoral and cellular components:Natural or innate immunity  is non-specific  and is\\nconsidered as the first line of defense without antigenicspecificity. It has 2 major components:a)Humoral:  comprised by complement.\\nb)Cellular:  consists of neutrophils, macrophages, and\\nnatural killer (NK) cells.\\nSpecific or adaptive immunity  is specific  and is\\ncharacterised by antigenic specificity. It too has 2 maincomponents:a)Humoral:  consisting of antibodies formed by B cells.\\nb)Cellular:  mediated by T cells.\\nThe various components of both types of immunity are\\ninterdependent and interlinked for their functions.\\nSTRUCTURE OF IMMUNE SYSTEM\\nORGANS OF IMMUNE SYSTEM\\nAlthough functioning as a system, the organs of immune\\nsystem are distributed at different places in the body.  Theseare as under:\\na) Primary lymphoid organs:\\ni) Thymus\\nii)Bone marrow\\nb) Secondary lymphoid organs:i\\n) Lymph nodes\\nii) Spleeniii) MALT (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue located in\\nthe respiratory tract and GIT).\\nThese organs have been described in the respective\\nchapters in the book.\\nCELLS OF IMMUNE SYSTEM\\nThe cells comprising immune system are as follows:\\ni) Lymphocytes\\nii)Monocytes and macrophages\\niii)\\nMast cells and basophils\\niv) Neutrophils\\nv) Eosinophils\\nWhile morphologic aspects of these cells are covered\\nelsewhere in the book, their immune functions are briefly\\nconsidered below and summarised in Table 4.1 .\\nLymphocytes\\nLymphocyte is the master of human immune system.\\nMorphologically, lymphocytes appear as a homogeneousgroup but functionally two major lymphocyte populations,T and B  lymphocytes  are identified; while a third type, NK\\n(natural killer) cells , comprises a small percentage of\\ncirculating lymphocytes having the distinct appearance of\\nlarge granular lymphocytes . Figure 4.1 Antigen-antibody reactions. Primary and secondary\\nreactions occur in vitro  while tissue damage results from in vivo Ag-Ab\\nreaction.\\n62SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nJust as other haematopoietic cells, all three subtypes of\\nlymphocytes are formed from lymphoid precursor cells in\\nthe bone marrow. However, unlike other haematopoieticcells, lymphocytes undergo maturation and differentiationin the bone marrow (B cells) and thymus (T cells) and acquirecertain genetic and immune surface characters whichdetermine their type and function; this is based on cluster of\\ndifferentiation  (CD) molecule on their surface. CD surface\\nprotein molecules belong to immunoglobulin superfamilyof cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). About 250 differentsurface CD molecules have been identified so far, which canbe identified by ‘CD markers’ by specific monoclonalantibody stain employing immunohistochemistry or by flowcytometry.  B and T lymphocytes proliferate into ‘ memory\\ncells ’ imparting long lasting immunity against specific\\nantigens.\\nWhile B cells differentiate into plasma cells which form\\nspecific antibodies, T cells get functionally activated oncoming in contact with appropriate antigen. Upon comingin contact with antigen, it is the macrophage, i.e. specialised\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 4.1: Cells of the Immune System and their Functions.\\nCells Functions\\n1.

(BCR = B cell receptor, TCR = T cell receptor).antigen-presenting cell such as dendritic cell, and the major\\nhistocompatibilty complex (MHC) in the macrophage, which\\ndetermines whether the invading antigen is to be presentedto B cells or T cells. Some strong antigens that cannot be dealtby antibody response from B cells such as certainmicroorganisms (e.g. viruses, mycobacteria M. tuberculosis\\nand M. leprae ), cancer cells, tissue transplantation antigen etc,\\nare presented to T cells.\\nFeatures and functions of subtypes of lymphocytes are\\nsummed up below and illustrated diagrammatically inFig. 4.2:\\nB CELLS.   These cells are involved in humoral immunity by\\ninciting antibody response. B cells in circulation comprise\\nabout 10-15% of lymphocytes. On coming in contact withantigen (e.g. invading microorganims), B cells are activatedto proliferate and transform into plasmacytoid lymphocytesand then into plasma cells. Depending upon the maturationstage of B cells, specific CD molecules appear on the cell\\nsurface which can be identified by CD markers; common B\\ncell markers include: CD 19, 20, 21, 23. These cells also possessB cell receptors (BCR) for surface immunoglobulins (IgM andIgG) and Fc receptor for attaching to antibody molecule.T cell help is provided to B cells by a subset of T helper cells,T\\nH 2, by elaborated interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13).\\nT CELLS.  These cells are implicated in inciting cell-mediated\\nimmunity and delayed type of hypersensitivity. T cells in\\ncirculation comprise 75-80% of lymphocytes. Pan T cellmarkers are CD3, CD7and CD2. Besides, T cells also carryreceptor (TCR) for recognition of MHC molecules. Dependingupon functional activity, T cells have two major subtypes: T\\nhelper cells  and T suppressor cells.\\nT helper cells . Abbreviated as T\\nH cells, these cells promote\\nand enhance the immune reaction and are also termed as\\nT-regulatory cells . They carry CD4 molecule on their surface\\nand hence are also called CD4+ cells . CD4+ cells in circulation\\nare about twice the number of CD8+ cells (CD4+/CD8 ratio2:1). These cells act by elaboration of variety of cytokines.Depending upon the type of cytokines elaborated, these\\nT\\nH cells are further of two subclasses: TH 1 and TH 2.\\nTH 1 cells  elaborate IL-2 and interferon (IFN)- γ.\\nTH 2 cells  elaborate IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10.\\nCD4+ cells are predominantly involved in cell-mediated\\nreactions to viral infections (e.g. in HIV), tissue transplant\\nreactions and tumour lysis.\\nT suppressor cells.  Abbreviated as TS cells, they suppress\\nimmune reactions but are cytotoxic and actually destroy the\\ninvading antigen; hence are also termed as cytotoxic T\\nlymphocytes (CTL) .  These cells carry CD8 molecule on their\\nsurface and hence are also called CD8+ cells . CD8+ cells in\\ncirculation are about half the number of CD4+ cells.Compared to CD4+ cells which act by elaboration of\\ncytokines, CD8+ cells are directly cytotoxic to the antigen.\\nCD8+ cells are particularly involved in destroying cells\\ninfected with viruses, foreign cells and tumour cells.\\nContrasting features of B and T cells are given in\\nTable 4.2.\\n64SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesNATURAL KILLER (NK) CELLS.  NK cells comprise about\\n10-15% of circulating lymphocytes. These lymphocytes do\\nnot have B or T cell markers, nor are these cells dependentupon thymus for development unlike CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells. NK cells carry surface molecules of CD2, CD16 andCD56, but negative for T cell marker CD3. NK cells aremorphologically distinct from B and T cells in being large\\ngranular lymphocytes .\\nNK cells are part of the natural or innate immunity. These\\ncells recognise antibody-coated target cells and bring aboutkilling of the target directly; this process is termed as antibody-\\ndependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) . This mechanism\\nis particularly operative against viruses and tumour cells.\\nMonocytes and Macrophages\\nThe role of macrophages in inflammation consisting of\\ncirculating monocytes, organ-specific macrophages andhistiocytes has been described in Chapter 6. Circulatingmonocytes are immature macrophages and constitute about5% of peripheral leucocytes. They remain in circulation forabout 3 days before they enter tissues to become macrophages.The macrophage subpopulations like the dendritic cells foundin the lymphoid tissue and Langerhans’ cells seen in theepidermis, are characterised by the presence of dendriticcytoplasmic processes and are active in the immune system.\\nSalient features and important immune functions of\\nmacrophages are as follows:\\n1. Antigen recognition.  They possess cell surface receptors\\nto several extracellular molecules— receptor for cytokines,\\ncomponent of complement (C3b), selectins, integrins and Fc(constant fragment) of antibody. These receptors recognise\\nthe organisms and initiate intracellular mechanism in\\nmacrophages. Antigen to become recognisable can also get\\ncoated by antibodies or complement, the process being\\ntermed as opsonisation .  Macrophages have capacity to\\ndistinguish self from non-self by presence of human leucocyteantigens (HLA) or major histocompatibilty complex (MHC)\\ndiscussed below.\\n2.  Phagocytosis.  Antigen that has been recognised by the\\nmacrophages due to availability of above-mentioned surface\\nreceptors, or the opsonised antigen, is ready to be engulfedby the process of cell-eating by macrophages explained onpage 134.\\n3. Secretory function. Macrophages secrete important\\nsubstances as follows:\\ni) Cytokines  (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, 8, IL-10, IL-12, tumour necrosis\\nfactor- α) and prostaglandins  (PGE, thromboxane-A,\\nleukotrienes) which are chemical mediators of  inflammation\\nand activate other leucocytes.\\nii) Secretion of proteins involved in wound healing  e.g.\\ncollagenase, elastase, fibroblast growth factor, angiogenesis\\nfactor.\\niii) Acute phase reactants  e.g. fibronectin, microglobulin,\\ncomplement components.\\n4. Antigen presentation.   When macrophages are unable to\\nlyse an antigen or an organism, the next best course adopted\\nby them is to act as antigen-presenting cells for presentingto immunocompetent T cells (subtype CD4+ or CD8+ cells),or to B cells. Accordingly, the lymphoid cell would then dealwith such antigen.\\nBasophils and Mast Cells\\nBasophils are a type of circulating granulocytes (0-1%) while\\nmast cells are their counterparts seen in tissues, especiallyin connective tissue around blood vessels and in submucosallocation. Basophils and mast cells have IgE surface receptor;thus on coming in contact with antigen binding to IgE (e.g.allergic reaction to parasites), these cells get activated andrelease granules i.e. degranulate. These granules containsubstances such as: histamine, platelet activating factor,heparin and certain chemical mediators (e.g. prostaglandins,leukotrienes).\\nMast cells and basophils are thus involved in mediating\\ninflammation in allergic reactions and have a role in woundhealing.\\nNeutrophils\\nPolymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are normally the\\nmost numerous of the circulating leucocytes (40-75%). Thecytoplasm of PMNs contains lysosomal granules of threetypes: primary (azurophilic), secondary, and tertiary.\\nPMNs have similar function to those of macrophages and\\nare therefore appropriately referred to as ‘microphages ’ owing\\nto their role as first line of defense against an invading foreignorganism in the body. However, these cells have limitationof size and type of organisms to be engulfed e.g. while theyare capable of acting against bacteria and small foreignparticulate material but not against viruses and largeparticles.\\nEosinophils\\nEosinophils are also circulating granulocytes (1-6%). These\\ncells play a role in allergic reactions and in intestinalhelminthiasis. The granules of eosinophils contain lysosomalenzymes, peroxidases, and chemical mediators ofinflammation (e.g. prostaglandins, leukotrienes). On comingin contact with IgE opsonised antigen (e.g. helminths),eosinophils degranulate and release the chemicals stored ingranules and incite inflammation.\\nHLA SYSTEM AND MAJOR\\nHISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX\\nThough not a component of immune system, HLA system isdescribed here as it is considered important in the regulationof the immune system. HLA stands for Human Leucocyte\\nAntigens  because these antigens or genetic proteins in the\\nbody which determine one’s own tissue from non-self(histocompatibility) were first discovered on the surface ofleucocytes. Subsequently, it was found that HLA are actuallygene complexes of proteins on the surface of all nucleatedcells of the body and platelets. Since these complexes are ofimmense importance in matching donor and recipient fororgan transplant, they are called major histocompatibilitycomplex (MHC) or HLA complex.65CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including AmyloidosisOut of various genes for histocompatibility, most of the\\ntransplantation antigens or MHC are located on a portion of\\nchromosome 6 of all nucleated cells of the body and platelets .\\nThese genes occupy four regions or loci—A, B, C and D, onthe short (p) arm of chromosome 6 and exhibit markedvariation in allelic genes at each locus. Therefore, the productof HLA antigens is highly polymorphic. The letter w in someof the genes (e.g. D\\nw3, Cw4, Bw15 etc) refers to the numbers\\nallocated to them at international workshops. HLA systemis part of immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs.\\nDepending upon the characteristics of MHC, they have\\nbeen divided into 3 classes  (Fig. 4.2):\\nClass I MHC antigens  have loci as HLA-A, HLA-B and\\nHLA-C. CD8+ (i.e. T suppressor) lymphocytes carryreceptors for class I MHC and these cells are used to identifyclass I antigen on them.\\nClass II MHC antigens  have single locus as HLA-D.\\nThese antigens have further 3 loci: DR, DQ and DP. Class IIMHC is identified by B cells and CD4+ (i.e. T helper) cells.\\nClass III MHC antigens  are some components of the\\ncomplement system (C2 and C4) coded on HLA complex butare not associated with HLA expression and are not used inantigen identification.\\nIn view of high polymorphism of class I and class II genes,\\nthey have a number of alleles on loci numbered serially likeHLA-A 1, HLA-A 2, HLA-A 3 etc.\\nMHC antigens present on the cell surface help the\\nmacrophage in its function of bacterial antigen recognitioni.e. they help to identify self from foreign, and accordinglypresent the foreign antigen to T cells (CD4+ or CD8+) or to Bcells.\\nROLE OF HLA COMPLEX.  The HLA complex is significant\\nin a number of ways:1. Organ transplantation.  Historically, the major\\nimportance of HLA system is in matching donor and recipient\\nfor tissue transplantation. The recipient’s immune systemcan recognise the histocompatibility antigens on the donororgan and accordingly accept it or reject it. Both humoral aswell as cell-mediated immune responses are involved in caseof genetically non-identical transplants.\\n2. Regulation of the immune system.  Class I and II\\nhistocompatibility antigens play a role in regulating both\\ncellular and humoral immunity:\\nClass I MHC antigens  regulate the function of cytotoxic\\nT cells (CD8+ subpopulation) e.g. in virus infections.\\nClass II MHC antigens  regulate the function of helper\\nT cells (CD4+ subpopulation).\\n3. Association of diseases with HLA.  An increasing\\nnumber of diseases have been found to have association with\\nsome specific histocompatibility antigens. These disordersinclude the following:\\ni)Inflammatory  disorders e.g. ankylosing spondylitis.\\nii)Autoimmune  disorders e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-\\ndependent diabetes mellitus.iii)Inherited disorders of metabolism  e.g. idiopathic\\nhaemochromatosis.\\nThe exact mechanism of such associations between the\\ndisease and HLA type is not clearly understood.\\nTRANSPLANT REJECTION\\nAccording to the genetic relationship between donor and\\nrecipient, transplantation of tissues is classified into 4 groups:1.Autografts  are grafts in which the donor and recipient is\\nthe same individual.2.Isografts  are grafts between the donor and recipient of\\nthe same genotype.3.Allografts  are those in which the donor is of the same\\nspecies but of a different genotype.4.Xenografts  are those in which the donor is of a different\\nspecies from that of the recipient.\\nAll types of grafts have been performed in human beings\\nbut xenografts have been found to be rejected invariably dueto genetic disparity. Presently, surgical skills exist for skingrafts and for organ transplants such as kidney, heart, lungs,liver, pancreas, cornea and bone marrow. But mostcommonly practised are skin grafting, and kidney and bonemarrow transplantation. For any successful tissue transplantwithout immunological rejection, matched major histocom-patibility locus antigens (HLA) between the donor andrecipient are of paramount importance as discussed already.The greater the genetic disparity between donor and recipientin HLA system, the stronger and more rapid will be therejection reaction.\\nBesides the rejection reaction, a peculiar problem\\noccurring especially in bone marrow transplantation is graft-\\nversus-host (GVH) reaction . In humans, GVH reaction results\\nwhen immunocompetent cells are transplanted to animmunodeficient recipient e.g. when severe combined immu-nodeficiency is treated by bone marrow transplantation. The\\nFigure 4.3 HLA system and loci on chromosome 6.\\n66SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesclinical features of GVH reaction include: fever, weight loss,\\nanaemia, dermatitis, diarrhoea, intestinal malabsorption,pneumonia and hepatosplenomegaly. The intensity of GVHreaction depends upon the extent of genetic disparitybetween the donor and recipient.\\nMechanisms of Graft Rejection\\nExcept for autografts and isografts, an immune response\\nagainst allografts is inevitable. The development ofimmunosuppressive drugs has made the survival ofallografts in recipients possible. Rejection of allograftsinvolves both cell-mediated and humoral immunity.\\n1. CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNE REACTIONS.  These are\\nmainly responsible for graft rejection and are mediated by\\nT cells. The lymphocytes of the recipient on coming incontact with HLA antigens of the donor are sensitised incase of incompatibility. Sensitised T cells in the form ofcytotoxic T cells (CD8+) as well as by hypersensitivityreactions initiated by T helper cells (CD4+) attack the graftand destroy it.\\n2. HUMORAL IMMUNE REACTIONS.  Currently, in\\naddition to the cell-mediated immune reactions, a role for\\nhumoral antibodies in certain rejection reactions has beensuggested. These include: preformed circulating antibodies  due\\nto pre-se nsitisation  of the recipient before transplantation e.g.\\nby blood transfusions and previous pregnancies, or in non-\\nsensitised individuals  by complement dependent cytotoxicity,\\nantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and\\nantigen-antibody complexes.\\nTypes of Rejection Reactions\\nBased on the underlying mechanism and time period,\\nrejection reactions are classified into 3 types: hyperacute,acute and chronic.\\n1\\n. HYPERACUTE REJECTION.  Hyperacute rejection\\nappears within minutes to hours of placing the transplant\\nand destroys it. It is mediated by preformed humoralantibody against donor-antigen. Cross-matching of thedonor’s lymphocytes with those of the recipient before\\ntransplantation has diminished the frequency of hyperacute\\nrejection.\\nGrossly , hyperacute rejection is recognised by the surgeon\\nsoon after the vascular anastomosis of the graft isperformed to the recipient’s vessels. The organ becomesswollen, oedematous, haemorrhagic, purple and cyanoticrather than gaining pink colour.\\nHistologically , the characteristics of Arthus reaction are\\npresent. There are numerous neutrophils around dilated\\nand obstructed capillaries which are blocked by fibrin andplatelet thrombi. Small segments of blood vessel wall may\\nbecome necrotic and there is necrosis of much of the\\ntransplanted organ. Small haemorrhages are common.\\n2. ACUTE REJECTION.  This usually becomes evident\\nwithin a few days to a few months of transplantation. Acutegraft rejection may be mediated by cellular or humoralmechanisms. Acute cellular rejection is more common than\\nacute humoral rejection.\\nMicroscopically,  the features of the two forms are   as\\nunder:\\nAcute cellular rejection  is characterised by extensive\\ninfiltration in the interstitium of the transplant by lympho-cytes (mainly T cells), a few plasma cells, monocytes and\\na few polymorphs. There is damage to the blood vessels\\nand there are foci of necrosis in the transplanted tissue.Acute humoral rejection  appears due to poor response to\\nimmunosuppressive therapy. It is characterised by acute\\nrejection vasculitis and foci of necrosis in small vessels.\\nThe mononuclear cell infiltrate is less marked as comparedto acute cellular rejection and consists mostly ofB lymphocytes.\\n3. CHRONIC REJECTION.  Chronic rejection may follow\\nrepeated attacks of acute rejection or may develop slowlyover a period of mo nths to a year or so. The underlying\\nmechanisms of chronic rejection may be immunologic orischaemic. Patients with chronic rejection of renal transplantshow progressive deterioration in renal function as seen byrising serum creatinine levels.\\nMicroscopically , in chronic rejection of transplanted\\nkidney, the changes are intimal fibrosis, interstitial fibrosisand tubular atrophy. Renal allografts may developglomerulonephritis by transmission from the host, orrarely may be de novo  glomerulonephritis.\\nDISEASES OF IMMUNITY\\nThe word immunity  is synonymous with resistance  meaning\\nprotection from particular diseases or injuries, whereas theterm hypersensitivity  is interchangeable with allergy  meaning\\na state of exaggerated or altered immune response to a given\\nagent. The diseases of the immune system are broadly\\nclassified into the following 4 groups:\\nI. Immunodeficiency disorders  characterised by deficient\\ncellular and/or humoral immune functions. This group is\\ncomprised by a list of primary and secondary immunodeficiency\\ndiseases  including the dreaded acquired immunodeficiency\\nsyndrome (AIDS) .\\nII. Hypersensitivity reactions  characterised by hyper-\\nfunction of the immune system and cover the various mecha-\\nnisms of immunologic tissue injury .\\nIII.  Autoimmune diseases  occur when the immune system\\nfails to recognise ‘self’ from ‘non-self’. A growing number ofautoimmune and collagen diseases  are included in this group.\\nIV.  Possible immune disorders  in which the immunologic\\nmechanisms are s uspected in their etiopathogenesis. Classical\\nexample of this group is amyloidosis  discussed later in this\\nchapter.67CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including AmyloidosisIMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES\\nFailure or deficiency of immune system, which normally\\nplays a protective role against infections, manifests byoccurrence of repeated infections in an individual havingimmunodeficiency diseases.\\nTraditionally, immunodeficiency diseases are classified\\ninto 2 types:\\nA.Primary immunodeficiencies  are usually the result of genetic\\nor developmental abnormality of the immune system.\\nB.Secondary immunodeficiencies  arise from acquired\\nsuppression of the immune system.\\nSince the first description of primary immunodeficiency\\nby Bruton in 1952, an increasing number of primary and\\nsecondary immunodeficiency syndromes are being addedto the list, the latest addition being the acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981.\\nA list of most immunodeficiency diseases with the\\npossible defect in the immune system is given in Table 4.3 ,\\nwhile an account of AIDS is given below.\\nACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)\\nSince the initial recognition of AIDS in the United States in\\n1981, tremendous advances have taken place in theunderstanding of this dreaded disease as regards its\\nepidemiology, etiology, immunology, pathogenesis, clinicalfeatures and morphologic changes in various tissues andorgans of the body. But efforts at finding its definite treatment\\nand a vaccine have not yielded success so far, and thus the\\nprognosis remains grim. Hence the global attention ispresently focussed on preventive measures.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY. Although AIDS was first described in the\\nUS, the disease has now attained pandemic proportions\\ninvolving all continents.  Presently, developing countriescomprise majority of cases and Africa alone constitutes 50%of all positive cases globally.  According to a rough estimate,\\n1 in every 100 sexually active adults worldwide is infected\\nwith HIV. Half of all serologically positive cases are in womenwhile children comprise 5% of all cases. According to theWHO data, the last decade has shown an alarming rise inincidence of AIDS cases in South-East Asia includingThailand, Indonesia and Indian sub-continent.  However,\\ngiving exact figures of cases is pointless since the numbers\\nare increasing by millions and all such data become outdatedwith every passing year. About 2.5 million new cases are\\ngetting added every year. In India, epicentre of the epidemiclies in the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu which\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 4.3: lmmunodeficiency Diseases.\\nDisease Defect\\nA.

Transplant cases Immunosuppressive therapy68SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquestogether comprise about 50% of all HIV positive cases (mostly\\ncontracted sexually), while North-East state of Manipuraccounts for 8% of all cases (mostly among intravenous drugabusers).\\nETIOLOGIC AGENT.  AIDS is caused by an RNA retrovirus\\ncalled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which is a type\\nof human T cell leukaemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV).\\nHIV resembles other HTLVs in shape and size and both\\nhave tropism for CD4 molecules  present on subpopulation of\\nT cells which are the particular targets of attack by HIV.However, HIV differs from HTLV in being cytolytic for T cells\\ncausing immunodeficiency (cytopathic virus) while HTLV maytransform the target cells into T cell leukaemia (transforming virus)(Chapter 8). Two forms of HIV have been described, HIV1being the etiologic agent for AIDS in the US and CentralAfrica, while HIV2 causes a similar disease in West Africaand parts of India. Both HIV1 and HIV2 are zoonoticinfections and their origin can be traced to a species ofchimpanzees who are natural reservoir of HIV and mostlikely source of original infection.\\nHIV-I virion or virus particle  is spherical in shape and 100-\\n140 nm in size  (Fig. 4.4):\\nIt contains a core having core proteins , chiefly p24 and p18,\\ntwo strands of genomic RNA and the enzyme, reverse\\ntranscriptase.\\nThe core is covered by a double layer of lipid membrane\\nderived from the outer membrane of the infected host cell\\nduring budding process of virus. The membrane is studded\\nwith 2 envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41 , in the positions\\nshown.\\nBesides various other genes, three important genes  code\\nfor the respective components of virion:i) gag  (group antigen)  for core proteins,\\nii) pol  (polymerase)  for reverse transcriptase, and\\niii) env  (envelope)  for the envelope proteins.These genes and viral components act as markers for the\\nlaboratory diagnosis of HIV infection. Besides, there is tat\\n(transcription activator)  gene for viral functions such as\\namplification of viral genes, viral budding and replication.\\nROUTES OF TRANSMISSION.  Transmission of HIV\\ninfection occurs by one of following three routes:\\n1.Sexual transmission.  Sexual contact in the main mode\\nof spread and constitutes 75% of all cases of HIV\\ntransmission. Most cases of AIDS in the industrialised worldlike in the US occur in homosexual  or bisexual males  while\\nheterosexual promiscuity  seems to be the dominant mode of\\nHIV infection in Africa and Asia. Other sexually transmitteddiseases (STDs) may act as cofactors for spread of HIV, inparticular gonorrhoeal and chlamydial infection.Transmission from male-to-male and male-to-female is morepotent route than that from female-to-male.\\n2. Transmission via blood and blood products.  This mode\\nof transmission is the next largest group (25%) and occurs in\\n3 groups of high-risk populations:\\ni)Intravenous drug abusers  by sharing needles, syringes etc\\ncomprise a large group in the US.\\nii)Haemophiliacs  who have received large amounts of\\nclotting factor concentrates from pooled blood components\\nfrom multiple donors.\\niii)Recipients of HIV-infected blood and blood products  who have\\nreceived multiple transfusions of whole blood or components\\nlike platelets and plasma.\\n3. Perinatal transmission.  HIV infection occurs from infected\\nmother to the newborn during pregnancy transplacentally , or\\nin immediate post-partum period through contamination  with\\nmaternal blood, infected amniotic fluid or breast milk.\\n4.\\nOccupational transmission.  There have been a small\\nnumber of health care workers (HCW), laboratory workers\\nand those engaged in disposal of waste of sharps who havedeveloped HIV infection by occupational exposure to HIV-infected material. It is imperative that these workers followCDC guidelines for universal precautions  which include\\ndisinfecting and sterilizing all reusable devices and use ofbleaching solution for disinfecting all blood spillage.\\n5. Transmission by other body fluids.  Although besides\\nblood, HIV has been isolated and identified from a number\\nof body fluids such as saliva, tears, sweat and urine, semen,vaginal secretions, cervical secretions, breast milk, CSF,synovial, pleural, peritoneal and pericardial fluid, there isno definite evidence that HIV transmission can occur by anyof these fluids; isolated cases of such infection reported arein likelihood due to concomitant contamination with HIV-infected blood.\\nIt may, however, be understood regarding spread of HIV\\ninfection that AIDS cannot be transmitted by  casual non-sexual\\ncontact like shaking hands, hugging, sharing householdfacilities like beds, toilets, utensils etc.\\nIt should also be appreciated that HIV contaminated\\nwaste products can be sterilised and disinfected by most of the\\nchemical germicides used in laboratories at a much lowerconcentration. These are: sodium hypochlorite (liquid\\nFigure 4.4 Schematic representation of HIV virion or virus particle.\\nThe particle has core containing proteins, p24 and p18, two strands of\\nviral RNA, and enzyme reverse transcriptase.

HIV is also heat-\\nsensitive and can be inactivated at 56°C for 30 min.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The pathogenesis of HIV infection is\\nlargely related to the depletion of CD4+ T cells (helper T cells)\\nresulting in profound immunosuppression.\\nThe sequence of events shown schematically in Fig. 4.5\\nis outlined below:\\n1. Selective tropism for CD4 molecule receptor.  gp120\\nenvelope glycoprotein of HIV has selective tropism for cells\\ncontaining CD4 molecule receptor on their surface; thesecells most importantly are CD4+ T cells (T helper cells);other such cells include monocyte-macrophages, microglialcells, epithelial cells of the ce rvix, Langerhans cells of the\\nskin and follicular dendritic cells. Initially, HIV on enteringthe body via any route described above has tropism formacrophages (M-tropic) while later it becomes either dualtropic or T-tropic only and thus affects mainly CD4+ T cellswhich are the main target of attack by HIV.\\n2.Internalisation.  gp120 of the virion combines with CD4\\nreceptor, but for fusion of virion with the host cell membrane,\\na chemokine coreceptor (CCR) is necessary. Once HIV hascombined with CD4 receptor and CCR, gp41 glycoproteinof envelope is internalised in the CD4+ T cell membrane.\\n3. Uncoating and viral DNA formation.  Once the virion has\\nentered the T cell cytoplasm, reverse transcriptase of the viral\\nRNA forms a single-stranded DNA. Using the single-stranded DNA as a template, DNA polymerase copies it tomake it double-stranded DNA, while destroying the originalRNA strands. Viral DNA so formed has frequent mutationsmaking the HIV quite resistant to anti-viral therapy.\\n4. Viral integration. The viral DNA so formed may initially\\nremain unintegrated  in the affected cell but later viral integrase\\nprotein inserts the viral DNA into nucleus of the host T cell\\nand integrates  in the host cell DNA. At this stage, viral particle\\nis termed as HIV provirus .\\n5. Viral replication. HIV provirus having become part of host\\ncell DNA, host cell DNA transcripts for viral RNA withpresence of tat gene. Multiplication of viral particles is further\\nfacilitated by release of cytokines from T helper cells (CD4+T cells): T\\nH 1 cells  elaborating IL-2 and IFN- γ., and TH 2 cells\\nelaborating IL-4, IL-5, IL6, IL-10. RNA viral particles thusfill the cytoplasm of host T cell from where they acquireprotein coating. Released cytokines are also responsible forspread of infection to other body sites, in particular to CNSby TNF- α.\\n6. Latent period and immune attack. In an inactive infected\\nT cell, the infection may remain in latent phase for a longtime, accounting for the long incubation period. Immunesystem does act against the virus by participation of CD4+and CD8+ T cells, macrophages and by formation ofantibodies to mount attack against the virus. However, thisperiod is short and the virus soon overpowers the hostimmune system.\\n7. CD4+ T cell destruction. Viral particles replicated in the\\nCD4+ T cells start forming buds  from the cell wall of the host\\ncell. As these particles detach from the infected host cell, theydamage part of the cell membrane of the host cell and cause\\ndeath of host CD4+ T cells by apoptosis. Other proposedmechanisms of CD4+ T cell destruction are necrosis of\\nFigure 4.5 Sequence of events in the pathogenesis of HIV infection.\\n70SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesprecursors of CD4+ cells by the virus and by formation of\\nsyncytial giant cells due to attachment of more and more ofgp120 molecules to the surface of CD4+ T cells.\\n8. Viral dissemination.  Release of viral particles from\\ninfected host cell spreads the infection to more CD4+ host\\ncells and produces viraemia. Through circulation, virus gainsentry to the lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes, spleen) whereit multiplies further, and are the dominant site of virusreservoir rather than circulation.\\n9. Impact of HIV infection on other immune cells.  HIV\\ninfects other cells of the host immune system and also affects\\nnon-infected lymphoid cells.\\nOther cells of the immune system  which get infected are\\ncirculating moncytes, macrophage in tissues and dendriticfollicular cells of lymph nodes. HIV-infected monocytes-macrophages do not get destroyed but instead become areservoir of HIV infection. Infected dendritic follicular cellsof the lymph nodes causes massive enlargement of folliclecentres and account for persistent generalised lymph-adenopathy in AIDS.\\nNon-infected lymphoid cells  include B cells, NK cells and\\nCD8+ T cells. B cells do not have receptors for HIV but thenumber of B cells slowly declines, their function ofimmunoglobulin synthesis is impaired due to lack ofactivation by depleting CD4+ T cells, but instead there maybe non-specific hypergammaglobulinaemia. NK cells are alsoreduced due to lack of cytokines from CD4+ T cells. CD8+cells show lymphocytosis but the cells having intact functionof ADCC are reduced, possibly due to CD4+ T cellquantitative loss and qualitative dysfunction (reversal ofCD4+ T cells: CD8+ T cell ratio).\\nThe net result of immunological changes in the host due\\nto HIV infection lead to profound immunosuppressionrendering the host susceptible to opportunistic infections andtumours, to which he ultimately  succumbs.\\n10. HIV infection of nervous system.  Out of non-lymphoid\\norgan involvement, HIV infection of nervous system is the\\nmost serious and 75-90% of AIDS patients may demonstratesome form of neurological involvement at autopsy. It infectsmicroglial cells, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes as under:\\ni) Infection carried to the microglia of the nervous system\\nby HIV infected CD4+ monocyte-macrophage subpopulation or\\nendothelial cells.\\nii)Direct infection  of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.iii) Neurons are not invaded by HIV but are affected due to\\nattachment of gp120 and by release of cytokines  by HIV-\\ninfected macrophages.\\nA summary of major abnormalities in the immune system\\nin AIDS is given in Table 4.4 .\\nNATURAL HISTORY.  HIV infection progresses from an\\nearly acute syndrome to a prolonged asymptomatic state to\\nadvanced disease. Thus there are different clinical mani-festations at different stages. Generally, in an immuno-competent host, the biologic course passes through following3 phases (Table 4.5):\\n1. Acute HIV syndrome (3-12 weeks).  Entry of HIV into\\nthe body is heralded by the following sequence of events:\\ni)High levels of plasma viraemia  due to replication of the\\nvirus.\\nii)Virus-specific immune response by formation of anti-HIV\\nantibodies ( seroconversion ) after 3-6 weeks of initial exposure\\nto HIV.\\niii)\\nInitially, sudden marked reduction in CD4+ T cells  (helper\\nT cells) followed by return to normal levels.iv) Rise in CD8+ T cells  (Cytotoxic T cells).\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 4.4: Major Abnormalities in Immune System in AIDS.\\n1.

Manifestations include:sore throat, fever, myalgia, skin rash, and sometimes, asepticmeningitis. These symptoms resolve spontaneously in 2-3weeks.\\n2. Middle chronic phase (10-12 years).  The initial acute sero-\\nconversion illness is followed by a phase of competition\\nbetween HIV and the host immune response as under:\\ni)Viraemia  due to viral replication in the lymphoid tissue\\ncontinues which is initially not as high but with passage of\\ntime viral load increases due to crumbling host defenses.\\nii) Chronic stage, depending upon host immune system,\\nmay continue as long as 10 years .\\niii)CD 4+ T cells  continue to proliferate but net result is\\nmoderate fall in CD4+ T cell counts.\\niv) Cytotoxic CD8+ T cell count remains high.v) Clinically, it may be a stage of latency  and the patient\\nmay be asymptomatic, or may develop mild constitutional\\nsymptoms and persistent generalised lymphadenopathy.\\n3. Final crisis phase. This phase is characterised by\\nprofound immunosuppression and onset of full-blown AIDSand has the following features:\\ni) Marked increase in viraemia .\\nii) The time period from HIV infection through chronic\\nphase into full-blown AIDS may last 7-10 years and culminate\\nin death .\\niv) CD 4+ T cells  are markedly reduced (below 200 per μl).\\nThe average survival after the onset of full-blown AIDS\\nis about 2 years.\\nChildren often have a rapidly progressive disease and\\nfull blown AIDS occurring at 4 to 8 years of age.\\nREVISED CDC HIV CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM.  The\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US in\\n1993 revised the classification system for HIV infection inadults and children based on 2 parameters: clinical mani-festations and CD4+ T cell counts. According to this classi-fication, HIV-AIDS has 3 categories: A, B and C (Table 4.5).\\nCategory A:  Includes a variety of conditions: asymptomatic\\ncase, persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (PGL), and\\nacute HIV syndrome. CD4+ T cell counts in clinical categoryA are \\n>500/ μl.\\nCategory B:  Includes symptomatic cases and includes\\nconditions secondary to impaired cell-mediated immunitye.g. bacillary dysentery, mucosal candidiasis, fever, oral hairyleukoplakia, ITP, pelvic inflammatory disease, peripheralneuropathy, cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ cervixetc. CD4+ T cell counts in clinical category B are 200-499/ μl.\\nCategory C: This category includes conditions listed for AIDS\\nsurveillance case definition. These are mucosal candidiasis,cancer uterine cervix, bacterial infections (e.g. tuberculosis),fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis), parasitic infections(e.g. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), malnutrition and\\nwasting of muscles etc. CD4+ T cell counts in clinical categoryC are <200/ μl and are indicator for AIDS.Similarly, there are revised parameters for paediatric HIV\\nclassification  in which age-adjusted CD4+ T cell counts are\\ngiven which are relatively higher in each correspondingcategory.\\nPATHOLOGICAL LESIONS AND CLINICAL MANIFES-\\nTATIONS OF HIV/AIDS.  HIV/AIDS affects all body organs\\nand systems. In general, clinical manifestations andpathological lesions in different organs and systems areowing to progressive deterioration of body’s immune system.Disease Progression occurs in all untreated patients, even ifthe patient is apparently latent. Antiretroviral treatmentblocks and slows the progression of the disease. Pathologicallesions and clinical manifestations in HIV disease can beexplained by 4 mechanisms:\\ni. Due to viral infection directly:  The major targets are immune\\nsystem, central nervous system and lymph nodes (persistent\\ngeneralised lymphadenopathy).\\nii. Due to opportunistic infections:  Deteriorating immune system\\nprovides the body an opportunity to harbour micro-\\norganisms. A list of common opportunistic infectious agents\\naffecting HIV/AIDS is given in Fig. 4.6 .\\niii. Due to secondary tumours: End-stage of HIV/AIDS is\\ncharacterised by development of certain secondary malignanttumours.\\niv. Due to drug treatment : Drugs used in the treatment produce\\ntoxic effects. These include antiretroviral treatment,\\naggressive treatment of opportunistic infections andtumours.\\nBased on above mechanisms, salient clinical features and\\npathological lesions in different organs and systems are\\nbriefly outlined below and illustrated in Fig. 4.6 . However,\\nit may be mentioned here that many of the pathologicallesions given below may not become clinically apparentduring life and may be noted at autopsy alone.\\n1. Wasting syndrome.  Most important systemic\\nmanifestation corresponding to body’s declining immune\\nfunction is wasting syndrome defined as ‘involuntary lossof body weight by more than 10%’. It occurs due to multiplefactors such as malnutrition, increased metabolic rate,\\nmalabsorption, anorexia, and ill-effects of multiple\\nopportunistic infections.\\n2. Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy.  In early\\nasymptomatic stage during the course of disease, some\\npatients may develop persistent generalised lymphadeno-\\npathy (PGL). PGL is defined as presence of enlarged lymphnodes >1 cm at two or more extrainguinal sites for >3 monthswithout an obvious cause. There is marked cortical follicular\\nhyperplasia, due to proliferation of CD8+ T cells, B cells and\\ndendritic follicular histiocytes. HIV infected CD4+ T cells areseen in the mantle zone. In advanced cases of AIDS, lymphnodes show progressive depletion of lymphoid cells, or theremay be occurrence of opportunistic infection (e.g. M. avium\\nintracelluare, Histoplasma, Toxoplasma ) or appearance of\\nsecondary tumours in the lymphoid tissue (e.g. Kaposi’s\\nsarcoma, lymphoma).72SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\n3. GI lesions and manifestations.  Almost all patients with\\nHIV infection develop gastrointestinal manifestations. These\\ninclude: chronic watery or bloody diarrhoea, oral, oropharyn-geal and oesophageal candidiasis, anorexia, nausea,vomiting, mucosal ulcers, abdominal pain.  These featuresare due to opportunistic infections (e.g. Candida , Clostridium ,\\nShigella , Salmonella , Giardia , Entamoeba histolytica , Crypto-\\nsporium , CMV). Advance cases may develop secondary\\ntumours occurring in GIT (e.g. Kaposi’s sarcoma, lymphoma).\\n4. Pulmonary lesions and manifestations.  Symptoms\\npertaining to lungs develop in about 50-75% of cases and\\nare a major cause of death in HIV/AIDS. These features arelargely due to opportunistic infections causing pneumoniae.g. with Pneumocystis carinii , M. tuberculosis , CMV, Histo-\\nplasma , and Staphylococci .  Lung abscess too may develop.\\nOther pulmonary manifestations include adult respiratorydistress syndrome and secondary tumours (e.g. Kaposi’ssarcoma, lymphoma).\\n5. Mucocutaneous lesions and manifestations. Symptoms\\ndue to mucocutaneous involvement occur in about 50 to 75%\\ncases. Mucocutaneous viral exanthem in the form oferythematous rash is seen at the onset of primary infectionitself. Other mucocutaneous manifestations are allergic (e.g.drug reaction, seborrhoeic dermatitis), infectious (viralinfections such as herpes, varicella zoster, EB virus, HPV;bacterial infections such as M. avium, Staph. aureus ; fungal\\ninfections such as Candida, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma ) and\\nneoplastic (e.g. Kaposi’s sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma,basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous lymphoma).\\n6. Haematologic lesions and manifestations.  Involvement\\nof haematopoietic system is common during the course of\\nHIV/AIDS. These include: anaemia, leucopenia, andthrombocytopenia. These changes are due to bone marrowsuppression from several mechanisms: infections such as byHIV, mycobacteria, fungi, and parvoviruses, or bylymphomatous involvement.\\n7. CNS lesions and manifestations.  Neurological\\nmanifestations occur in almost all cases during the course of\\ndisease and are an important cause of mortality andmorbidity. These may be inflammatory, demyelinating anddegenerative conditions. HIV encephalopathy or AIDS-associated dementia complex, is an AIDS defining conditionand manifests clinically with deteriorating cognitivesymptoms. Other pathological lesions in HIV/AIDS aremeningitis (tuberculous, cryptococcal) demyelinating lesionsof the spinal cord, and peripheral neuropathy and lymphomaof the brain.\\n8. Gynaecologic lesions and manifestations. Gynaecologic\\nsymptoms are due to monilial (candidal) vaginitis, cervical\\ndysplasia, carcinoma cervix, and pelvic inflammatorydisease.\\n9. Renal lesions and manifestations.  Features of renal\\nimpairment may appear due to HIV-associated nephropathy\\nand genitourinary tract infections including pyelonephritis.\\n10. Hepatobiliary lesions and manifestations. Manifesta-\\ntions of hepatobiliary tract are due to development of\\ncoinfection with hepatitis B or C, due to occurrence of otherinfections and due to drug-induced hepatic injury. Thelesions include steatosis,  granulomatous hepatitis andopportunistic infections ( M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium\\nintracellulare , Histoplasma ).\\n11. Cardiovascular lesions and manifestations. Heart\\ndisease  is common autopsy finding and include a form of\\ndilated cardiomyopathy called HIV-associated cardio-Figure 4.6 Major pathological lesions and clinical manifestations of HIV/AIDS.\\n73CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including Amyloidosismyopathy, pericardial effusion in advanced disease as a\\nreaction to opportunistic infection, lymphoma and Kaposi’ssarcoma.\\n12. Ophthalmic lesions.  HIV associated ocular manifes-\\ntations occur from opportunistic infections (e.g. CMV\\nretinitis), HIV retinopathy, and secondary tumours.\\n13. Musculoskeletal lesions. These include osteoporosis,\\nosteopaenia, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and polymyositis.\\n14. Endocrine lesions. Several metabolic derangements may\\noccur during the course of disease. There is syndrome of\\nlipodystrophy (buffalo hump) due to dyslipidaemia,hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia.  There may beabnormality of thyroid function, hypogonadism andinappropriate release of ADH.\\nLESIONS AND MANIFESTATIONS IN PAEDIATRIC\\nAIDS.  Children develop clinical manifestations of AIDS more\\nrapidly than adults. Besides development of opportunisticinfections and tumours, neurologic impairment in childrencauses slowing of development and growth.\\nDIAGNOSIS OF HIV/AIDS.  The investigations of a\\nsuspected case of HIV/AIDS are categorised into 3 groups:\\ntests for establishing HIV infection, tests for defects inimmunity, and tests for detection of opportunistic infectionsand secondary tumours. However, usually initial testing forantibodies is done against HIV by ELISA and confirmationby Western blot or immunofluorescence test. These tests areas under (Table 4.6):\\n1. Tests for establishing HIV infection: These includeantibody tests and direct detection of HIV.\\ni) Antibody tests:  These tests are as under:\\na) ELISA. Initial screening is done by serologic test for\\nantibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\\nagainst gag and env proteins. The term window period  is used\\nfor the initial 2 to 4 weeks period when the patient isinfectious but the screening test is negative, while serocon-\\nversion  is the term used for appearance of antibodies. Besideswindow period, ELISA may be false positive in autoanti-bodies, liver disease, recent vaccination against flu, and otherviral infections.\\nb) Western blot.  If ELISA is positive, confirmation is done by\\nWestern blot for presence of specific antibodies against all\\nthree HIV antigens: gag, pol and env .\\nii)\\nDirect detection of HIV:  These tests are as follows:\\na)  p24 antigen capture assay.\\nb)  HIV RNA  assay methods by reverse transcriptase (RT)\\nPCR, branched DNA, nucleic acid sequence-based\\namplification (NucliSens).\\nc) DNA-PCR  by amplification of proviral DNA.\\nd) Culture  of HIV from blood monocytes and CD4+ T cells.\\n2. Tests for defects in immunity: These tests are used for\\ndiagnosis as well as for monitoring treatment of cases.\\ni)CD4+ T cell counts. Progressive fall in number of CD4+ T\\ncells is of paramount importance in diagnosis and staging asCDC categories described above.ii)  Rise in CD8+ T cells.\\niii) Reversal of CD4+ to CD8+ T cell ratio.\\niv)  Lymphopenia.\\nv) Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia.vi) Increased β-2 microglobulin levels.\\nvii)Platelet count revealing thrombocytopenia.\\n3. Tests for detection of opportunistic infections and\\nsecondary tumours: Diagnosis of organs involved in\\nopportunistic infection and specific tumours secondary to\\nHIV/AIDS is made by aspiration or biopsy methods.\\nHYPERSENSITIVITY  REACTIONS\\n(IMMUNOLOGIC  TISSUE  INJUR Y)\\nHypersensitivity is defined as an exaggerated or inappropriate stateof normal immune response with onset of adverse effects on thebody.  The lesions of hypersensitivity are a form of antigen-\\nantibody reaction. These lesions are termed as hyper-sensitivity reactions or immunologic tissue injury, of which4 types are described: type I, II, III and IV.  Depending uponthe rapidity , duration and type  of the immune response, these\\n4 types of hypersensitivity reactions are grouped intoimmediate and delayed type:\\n1.Immediate type  in which on administration of antigen,\\nthe reaction occurs immediately (within seconds to minutes).\\nImmune response in this type is mediated largely by humoral\\nantibodies  (B cell mediated). Immediate type of hyper-\\nsensitivity  reactions includes type I, II and III.\\n2.Delayed type  in which the reaction is slower in onset\\nand develops within 24-48 hours and the effect is prolonged.It is mediated by cellular response   (T cell mediated) and it\\nincludes Type IV reaction.\\nThe mechanisms and examples of immunologic tissue\\ninjury by the 4 types of hypersensitivity reactions aresummarised in Table 4.7.\\nType I: Anaphylactic (Atopic) Reaction\\nType I hypersensitivity is defined as a state of rapidlydeveloping or anaphylactic type of immune response to an\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 4.6: Tests for Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS.\\n1.

Thereaction appears within 15-30 minutes of exposure to antigen.\\nETIOLOGY.  Type I reaction is mediated by humoral antibodies\\nof IgE type or reagin antibodies in response to antigen. Although\\ndefinite cause for this form of immediate reaction to allergen\\nis not known, following are the possible hypotheses:\\n1. Genetic basis . There is evidence that ability to respond to\\nantigen and produce IgE are both linked to genetic basis.\\nFor example, there is a 50% chance that a child born to bothparents allergic to an antigen, may have similar allergy.Further support to this basis comes from observations of highlevels of IgE in hypersensitive individuals and low level ofsuppressor T cells that controls the immune response areobserved in persons with certain HLA types (in particularHLA-B8).\\n2. Environmental pollutants.  Another proposed hypothesis\\nis that environmental pollutants increase mucosal\\npermeability and thus may allow increased entry of allergeninto the body, which in turn leads to raised IgE level.\\n3. Concomitant factors.  An alternate hypothesis is that\\nallergic response in type I reaction may be linked to\\nsimultaneous occurrence of certain viral infections of upperrespiratory tract in a susceptible individual.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Type I reaction includes participation by\\nB lymphocytes and plasma cells, mast cells and basophils,\\nneutrophils and eosinophils. Its mechanism is schematicallyshown in Fig. 4.7, A  and is briefly outlined below:\\ni) During the first contact  of the host with the antigen,\\nsensitisation  takes place. In response to initial contact with\\nantigen, circulating B lymphocytes get activated anddifferentiate to form IgE-secreting plasma cells.  IgEantibodies so formed bind to the Fc receptors present inplenty on the surface of mast cells and basophils, which arethe main effector cells of type I reaction. Thus, these cells arenow fully sensitised for the next event.\\nii) During the second contact with the same antigen, IgE\\nantibodies on the surface of mast cells-basophils are so firmlybound to Fc receptors that it sets in cell damage—membranelysis, influx of sodium and water and degranulation  of mast\\ncells-basophils.\\niii) The released granules contain important chemicals and\\nenzymes with proinflammatory  properties— histamine, sero-\\ntonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), chemotactic factorsof anaphylaxis for neutrophils and eosinophils, leukotrienesB\\n4 and D4, prostaglandins (thromboxane A2, prostaglandin\\nD2 and E2) and platelet activating factor. The effects of these\\nagents are:\\nincreased vascular permeability;\\nsmooth muscle contraction;\\nearly vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation;\\nshock;\\nincreased gastric secretion;\\nincreased nasal and lacrimal secretions; and\\nIncreased migration of eosinophils and neutrophils at the\\nsite of local injury as well as their rise in blood (eosinophiliaand neutrophilia).\\nEXAMPLES OF TYPE I REACTION.  The manifestations of\\ntype I reaction may be variable in severity and intensity. It\\nmay manifest as a local irritant (skin, nose, throat, lungs etc),or sometimes may be severe and life-threatening anaphylaxis.Common allergens which may incite local or systemic type Ireaction are as under:\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 4.7: Comparative Features of 4 Types of Hypersensitivity Reactions.\\nFeature Type I Type II Type III Type IV\\n(Anaphylactic, atopic) (Cytotoxic) (Immune-complex, (Delayed hypersensitivity)\\nArthus reaction)\\n1.Definition Rapidly developing \\nimmune Reaction of humoral antibodies Results from deposition of Cell-mediated slow and\\nresponse in a previously that attack cell surface antigens antigen-antibody complexes prolonged response\\nsensitised person and cause cell lysis on tissues\\n2.Peak action time 15-30 minutes 15-30 minutes Within 6 hours After 24 hours\\n3.Mediated by IgE antibodies IgG or IgM antibodies IgG, IgM antibodies Cell-mediated\\n4.Etiology Genetic basis, pollutants, HLA-linked, exposure to Persistence of low grade CD8+ T cells,viral infections foreign tissues/cells infection, environmental cutaneous antigens\\nantigens, autoimmuneprocess\\n5.Examples i.

TypeII reaction too appears generally within 15-30 minutes after\\nexposure to antigen but in myasthenia gravis and thyroiditisit may appear after longer duration.\\nETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS.  In general, type II\\nreactions have participation by complement system, tissue\\nmacrophages, platelets, natural killer cells, neutrophilsand eosinophils while main antibodies are  IgG and IgM.Type II hypersensitivity is tissue-specific and reactionoccurs after antibodies bind to tissue specific antigens,most often on blood cells. The mechanism involved is asunder ( Fig. 4.7, B):\\n i) The antigen on the surface of target cell (foreign cell)attracts and binds Fab portion of the antibody (IgG or IgM)forming antigen-antibody complex.ii) The unattached Fc fragment of antibodies (IgG or IgM)forms a link between the antigen and complement.iii) The antigen-antibody binding with Fc forming a linkcauses activation of classical pathway of serum complementwhich generates activated complement component, C3b, bysplitting C4 and C2 by C1.iv)  Activated C3b bound to the target cell acts as an opsoninand attracts phagocytes to the site of cell injury and initiatesphagocytosis.v) Antigen-antibody complex also activates complementsystem and exposes membrane attack complex (MAC) thatattacks and destroys the target cell.\\nEXAMPLES OF TYPE II REACTION.  Examples of type II\\nreaction are mainly on blood cells and some other body cells\\nand tissues.\\nCytotoxic antibodies to blood cells.  Most common examples\\nof type II reaction are on blood cells.\\ni)Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia  in which the red cell injury\\nis brought about by autoantibodies reacting with antigenspresent on red cell membrane. Antiglobulin test (directCoombs’ test) is employed to detect the antibody on red cell\\nsurface (Chapter 12).\\nii)Transfusion reactions  due to incompatible or mismatched\\nblood transfusion.\\niii)Haemolytic disease of the newborn ( erythroblastosis\\nfoetalis ) in which the foetal red cells are destroyed by maternal\\nisoantibodies crossing the placenta.iv)Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  (ITP) is the\\nimmunologic destruction of platelets by autoantibodies\\nreacting with surface components of normal plaletets.\\nv)Leucopenia with agranulocytosis  may be caused by\\nautoantibodies to leucocytes causing their destruction.vi)Drug-induced cytotoxic antibodies  are formed in response\\nto administration of certain drugs like penicillin, methyl\\ndopa, rifampicin etc. The drugs or their metabolites act as\\nhaptens binding to the surface of blood cells to which the\\nantibodies combine, bringing about destruction of cells.\\n2.Cytotoxic antibodies to tissue components.  Cellular\\ninjury may be brought about by autoantibodies reacting with\\nsome components of tissue cells in certain diseases.\\ni\\n) In Graves’ disease  (primary hyperthyroidism), thyroid\\nautoantibody is formed which reacts with the TSH receptor\\nto cause hyperfunction and proliferation.\\nii) In myasthenia gravis , antibody to acetylcholine receptors\\nof skeletal muscle is formed which blocks the neuromusculartransmission at the motor end-plate, resulting in muscleweakness.\\niii) In male sterility , antisperm antibody is formed which\\nreacts with spermatozoa and causes impaired motility as wellas cellular injury.\\niv) In type 1 diabetes mellitus , islet cell autoantibodies are\\nformed which react against islet cell tissue.v) In hyperacute rejection reaction , antibodies are formed\\nagainst donor antigen.\\nType III: Immune Complex Mediated (Arthus) Reaction\\nType III reactions result from deposition of antigen-antibody\\ncomplexes on tissues, which is followed by activation of the\\ncomplement system and inflammatory reaction, resulting incell injury. The onset of type III reaction takes place  about 6hours after exposure to the antigen.\\nETIOLOGY.  Type III reaction is not tissue specific and occurs\\nwhen antigen-antibody complexes fail to get removed by the\\nbody’s immune system. There can be 3 types of possibleetiologic factors precipitating type III reaction:\\n1. Persistence of low-grade microbial infection.  A low-\\ngrade infection with bacteria or viruses stimulates a\\nsomewhat weak antibody response. Persistence of infection(antigen) and corresponding weak antibody response leadsto chronic antigen-antibody complex formation. Since thesecomplexes fail to get eliminated from body fluids, they areinstead deposited in tissues e.g. in blood vessel wall,glomeruli, joint tissue etc.\\n2. Extrinsic environmental antigen . Exogenous antigens\\nmay be inhaled into the lungs e.g. antigens derived from\\nmoulds, plants or animals. The inhaled antigen combineswith antibody in the alveolar fluid and forms antigen-antibody complex which is deposited in the alveolar walls.3. Autoimmune process.  Another sequence in type III\\nreaction can be formation of autoantibodies against owntissue (self antigen) forming autoantibody-self antigencomplex. Such self antigens can be circulating (e.g. IgA) ortissue derived (e.g. DNA).  Immune complexes containingboth components from body’s own system can thus bedeposited in tissues.77CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including AmyloidosisPATHOGENESIS.  It may be mentioned here that both type\\nII and type III reactions have antigen-antibody complex\\nformation but the two can be distinguished— antigen in typeII is tissue specific while in type III is not so; moreover themechanism of cell injury in type II is direct but in type III itis by deposition of antigen-antibody complex on tissues andsubsequent sequence of cell injury takes place.\\nType III reaction has participation by IgG and IgM\\nantibodies, neutrophils, mast cells and complement. Thesequence of underlying mechanism is as under (Fig. 4.7, C):\\ni) Immune complexes are formed by interaction of solubleantibody and soluble or insoluble antigen.ii) Immune complexes which fail to get removed from bodyfluid get deposited into tissues. Generally, small andintermediate sized antibodies and antigens precipitate outof the body fluid and get deposited in tissues.iii) Fc component of antibody links with complement andactivates classical pathway of complement resulting information of C3a, C5a and membrane attack complex.iv) C3a stimulates release of histamine from mast cells andits resultant effects of increased vascular permeability andoedema.v) C5a releases proinflammatory mediators and chemotacticagents for neutrophils.vi) Accumulated neutrophils and macrophages in the tissuerelease cytokines and result in tissue destruction.\\nEXAMPLES OF TYPE III REACTION.  Common examples\\nof cell injury by type III injury are as under:\\ni)  Immune complex glomerulonephritis in which the antigenmay be GBM or exogenous agents (e.g. Streptococcalantigen).ii)  Goodpasture  syndrome having GBM as antigen. iii) SLE in which there is nuclear antigen (DNA, RNA) andthere is formation of anti-nuclear and anti-DNAautoantibodies.iv) Rheumatoid arthritis in which there is nuclear antigen.v) Farmer’s lung in which actinomycetes-contaminated hayacts as antigen.vi) Polyarteritis nodosa and Wegener’s granulomatosis withantineutrophil cytoplasmic antigen.vii) Henoch-Schönlein purpura in which respiratory virusesact as antigen.viii) Drug-induced vasculitis in which the drug acts asantigen.\\nType IV: Delayed Hypersensitivity (Cell-Mediated)\\nReaction\\nType IV or delayed hypersensitivity reaction is tissue injury\\nby cell mediated immune response without formation ofantibodies (contrary to type I, II and III) but is instead a slowand prolonged response of specifically-sensitised Tlymphocytes. The reaction occurs about 24 hours afterexposure to antigen and the effect is prolonged which maylast up to 14 days.\\nETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS.  Type IV reaction\\ninvolves role of mast cells and basophils, macrophages and\\nCD8+ T cells. Briefly, the mechanism of type IV reaction isas under (Fig. 4.7, D):i) The antigen is recognised by CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells)and is processed by antigen presenting cells.ii) Antigen-presenting cells migrate to lymph node whereantigen is presented to helper T cells (CD4+ T cells).iii) Helper T cells release cytokines that stimulate T cellproliferation and activate macrophages.iv) Activated T cells and macrophages release proinflam-matory mediators and cause cell destruction.\\nEXAMPLES OF TYPE IV REACTION.  Type IV reaction can\\nexplain tissue injury in following common examples:\\n1. Reaction against mycobacterial infection e.g. tuberculinreaction, granulomatous reaction in tuberculosis, leprosy.2. Reaction against virally infected cells.3. Reaction against malignant cells in the body.4. Reaction against organ transplantation e.g. transplantrejection, graft versus host reaction.\\nAUTOIMMUNE DISEASES\\nAutoimmunity  is a state in which the body’s immune system\\nfails to distinguish between ‘self’ and ‘non-self’ and reacts\\nby formation of autoantibodies against one’s own tissueantigens. In other words, there is loss of tolerance to one’sown tissues; autoimmunity is the opposite of immune tolerance .\\nImmune tolerance  is a normal phenomenon present since\\nfoetal life and is defined as the ability of an individual torecognise self tissue and antigens. Normally, the immunesystem of the body is able to distinguish self from non-selfantigens by the following mechanisms:\\n1.Clonal elimination.  According to this theory, during\\nembryonic development, T cells maturing in the thymus\\nacquire the ability to distinguish self from non-self. These Tcells are then eliminated by apoptosis for the tolerantindividual.\\n2.Concept of clonal anerg y. According to this mechanism, T\\nlymphocytes which have acquired the ability to distinguish\\nself from non-self are not eliminated but instead become non-responsive and inactive.\\n3.Suppressor T cells.  According to this mechanism, the\\ntolerance is achieved by a population of specific suppressor\\nT cells which do not allow the antigen-responsive cells toproliferate and differentiate.\\nPATHOGENESIS (THEORIES) OF AUTOIMMUNITY\\nThe mechanisms by which the immune tolerance of the body\\nis broken causes autoimmunity. These mechanisms ortheories of autoimmunity may be immunological, genetic,and microbial, all of which may be interacting.\\n1. Immunological factors.  Failure of immunological\\nmechanisms of tolerance initiates autoimmunity. These\\nmechanisms are as follows:\\ni)Polyclonal activation of B cells.  B cells may be directly\\nactivated by stimuli such as infection with microorganisms\\nand their products leading to bypassing of T cell tolerance.\\nii)Generation of self-reacting B cell clones  may also lead to\\nbypassing of T cell tolerance.\\niii)Decreased T suppressor and increased T helper cell activity .\\nLoss of T suppressor cell and increase in T helper cell78SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesactivities may lead to high levels of auto-antibody production\\nby B cells contributing to auto-immunity.\\niv)Fluctuation of anti-idiotype network control  may cause failure\\nof mechanisms of immune tolerance.\\nv)Sequestered antigen released from tissues . ‘Self-antigen’\\nwhich is completely sequestered may act as ‘foreign-antigen’\\nif introduced into the circulation later. For example, in traumato the testis, there is formation of anti-sperm antibodiesagainst spermatozoa; similar is the formation ofautoantibodies against lens crystallin.\\n2. Genetic factors.  There is evidence in support of genetic\\nfactors in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity as under:\\ni)There is increased expression of Class II HLA antigens  on\\ntissues involved in autoimmunity.\\nii\\n) There is increased familial incidence  of some of the\\nautoimmune disorders.\\n3. Microbial factors . Infection with microorganisms,\\nparticularly viruses (e.g. EBV infection), and less often\\nbacteria (e.g. streptococci, Klebsiella ) and mycoplasma, has\\nbeen implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.However, a definite evidence in support is lacking.\\nTYPES AND EXAMPLES OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES\\nDepending upon the type of autoantibody formation, the\\nautoimmune diseases are broadly classified into 2 groups:\\n1. Organ specific diseases.  In these, the autoantibodies\\nformed react specifically against an organ or target tissue\\ncomponent and cause its chronic inflammatory destruction.The tissues affected are endocrine glands (e.g. thyroid,pancreatic islets of Langerhans, adrenal cortex), alimentarytract, blood cells and various other tissues and organs.\\n2. Organ non-specific (Systemic) diseases.  These are\\ndiseases in which a number of autoantibodies are formed\\nwhich react with antigens in many tissues and thus causesystemic lesions. The examples of this group are varioussystemic collagen diseases.\\nHowever, a few autoimmune diseases overlap between\\nthese two main categories.\\nBased on these 2 main groups, a comprehensive list of\\nautoimmune (or collagen) diseases is presented in Table 4.8 .\\nSome of the systemic autoimmune diseases (marked with\\nasterisk)  are discussed in this chapter while others from both\\nthe groups are described later in the relevant chapters.\\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\\nSLE is the classical example of systemic autoimmune or\\ncollagen diseases. The disease derives its name ‘lupus’  from\\nthe Latin word meaning ‘wolf’ since initially this disease wasbelieved to affect skin only and eat away skin like a wolf.However, now 2 forms of lupus erythematosus are described:\\n1.Systemic or disseminated form  is characterised by acute\\nand chronic inflammatory lesions widely scattered in the\\nbody and there is presence of various nuclear andcytoplasmic autoantibodies in the plasma.2. Discoid form  is characterised by chronic and localised\\nskin lesions involving the bridge of nose and adjacent cheekswithout any systemic manifestations. Rarely, discoid formmay develop into disseminated form.\\nETIOLOGY.  The exact etiology of SLE is not known.\\nHowever, autoantibodies against nuclear and cytoplasmic\\ncomponents of the cells are demonstrable in plasma byimmunofluorescence tests in almost all cases of SLE. Someof the important antinuclear antibodies  (ANAs)  or antinuclear\\nfactors (ANFs)  against different nuclear antigens are  as\\nunder:\\ni)Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)\\n are the antibodies against\\ncommon nuclear antigen that includes DNA as well as RNA.\\nThese are demonstrable in about 98% cases and is the bestas screening test.\\nii) Antibodies to double-stranded (anti-dsDNA)  is the most\\nspecific  for SLE, especially in high titres, and is present in\\n70%  cases.\\niii)Anti-Smith antibodies (anti-Sm),  in which antibodies\\nappear against Smith antigen which is part of\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 4.8: Autoimmune Diseases.\\nORGAN NON-SPECIFIC (SYSTEMIC)\\n1.

Besides above, there are\\nseveral other antibody tests which lack specificity for SLE.\\nThese are as follows:a) Anti-ribonucleoproteins  (anti-RNP ) seen in 40% cases of SLE\\nbut seen more often in Sjögren’s syndrome.b) Anti-histone antibody , which is antibody against histone\\nassociated with DNA in chromatin, is seen particularly incases of drug-induced lupus than in SLE.c) Antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulant  are tests\\nfor thrombotic complications in cases of SLE.d) Antiribosomal P antibody is antibody against protein in\\nribosomes and is seen in CNS lupus.\\nThe source of these autoantibodies as well as hyper-\\ngammaglobulinaemia seen in SLE is the polyclonal activa-\\ntion of B cells  brought about by following derangements:\\n1.Immunologic factors.  These include:\\ni)an inherited defect in B cells;\\nii)stimulation of B cells by micro-organisms;\\niii)T helper cell hyperactivity; and\\niv)T suppressor cell defect.\\n2.Genetic factors.  Genetic predisposition to develop auto-\\nantibodies to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens in SLE is dueto the immunoregulatory function of class II HLA genesimplicated in the pathogenesis of SLE.\\n3.Other factors. Various other factors express the genetic\\nsusceptibility of an individual to develop clinical disease.\\nThese factors are:i)certain drugs e.g. penicillamine D;\\nii)certain viral infections e.g. EBV infection; and\\niii)certain hormones e.g. oestrogen.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The autoantibodies formed by any of the\\nabove mechanisms are the mediators of tissue injury in SLE.\\nTwo types of immunologic tissue injury can occur in SLE:\\n1.Type II hypersensitivity  is characterised by formation of\\nautoantibodies against blood cells (red blood cells, platelets,\\nleucocytes) and results in haematologic derangement in SLE.\\n2.Type III hypersensitivity  is characterised by antigen-anti-\\nbody complex (commonly DNA-anti-DNA antibody;\\nsometimes Ig-anti-Ig antibody complex) which is depositedat sites such as renal glomeruli, walls of small blood vesselsetc.\\nLE CELL PHENOMENON.  This was the first diagnostic\\nlaboratory test described for SLE. The test is based on the\\nprinciple that ANAs cannot penetrate the intact cells and thuscell nuclei should be exposed to bind them with the ANAs.\\nThe binding of exposed nucleus with ANAs results in\\nhomogeneous mass of nuclear chromatin material which iscalled LE body or haematoxylin body .\\nLE cell is a phagocytic leucocyte, commonly polymorpho-\\nnuclear neutrophil, and sometimes a monocyte, whichengulfs the homogeneous nuclear material of the injured cell.\\nFor demonstration of LE cell phenomenon in vitro, the blood\\nsample is traumatised to expose the nuclei of blood\\nleucocytes to ANAs. This results in binding of denaturedand damaged nucleus with ANAs. The ANA-coated\\ndenatured nucleus is c hemotactic for phagocytic cells.If this mass is engulfed by a neutrophil, displacing the\\nnucleus of neutrophil to the rim of the cell, it is called LE cell\\n(Fig. 4.8,A).\\nIf the mass, more often an intact lymphocyte, is phago-\\ncytosed by a monocyte, it is called Tart cell  (Fig. 4.8,B).\\nLE cell test is positive in 70% cases of SLE while newer\\nand more sensitive immunofluorescence tests for auto-antibodies listed above are positive in almost all cases of SLE.A few other conditions may also show positive LE test e.g.rheumatoid arthritis, lupoid hepatitis, penicillin sensitivityetc.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The manifestations of SLE\\nare widespread in different visceral organs as well as showerythematous cutaneous eruptions. The principal lesionsare renal, vascular, cutaneous and cardiac; other organsand tissues involved are serosal linings (pleuritis,pericarditis); joints (synovitis); spleen (vasculitis); liver(portal triaditis); lungs (interstitial pneumonitis, fibros-ing alveolitis), CNS (vasculitis) and in blood (autoimmunehaemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia).Histologically,  the characteristic lesion in SLE is fibrinoid\\nnecrosis  which may be seen in the connective tissue,\\nbeneath the endothelium in small blood vessels, underthe mesothelial lining of pleura and pericardium, underthe endothelium in endocardium, or under the synoviallining cells of joints.\\nTable 4.9 summarises the morphology of lesions in\\ndifferent organs and tissues in SLE.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  SLE, like most other autoimmune\\ndiseases, is more common in women in their 2nd to 3rddecades of life. As obvious from Table 4.9, SLE is amultisystem disease and thus a wide variety of clinicalFigure 4.8 Typical LE cell. There are two LE cells having rounded\\nmasses of amorphous nuclear material (LE body) which has displaced\\nthe lobes of neutrophil to the rim of the cell.\\n80SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquessystem, lungs, heart and blood vessels, GI system, and\\nhaematopoietic system. Fatigue and myalgia are present inmost cases throughout the course of disease. Severe form ofillness occurs with fever, weight loss, anaemia and organrelated manifestations.\\nFor making the diagnosis of SLE, four or more of the\\nfollowing diagnostic criteria need to be fulfilled:1. Malar rash  characterised by fixed erythema, flat or raised\\nover malar (mala= zygomatic bone) eminences.2. Discoid rash  characterised by erythematous circular raised\\npatches with keratotic scaling or follicular plugging.3. Photosensitivity  seen as rash on exposure to sunlight.\\n4. Oral ulcers which may extend to nasopharynx.5. Non-erosive arthritis  affecting two or more joints; may be\\nassociated with tenderness, swelling and effusion.6. Serositis as pleuritis or pericarditis.7. Renal manifestations seen as proteinuria >0.5 gm/dl (\\n>3+)\\nand cellular casts.8. Neurologic manifestations seen as seizures or psychosis.9. Haematologic derangements  seen as haemolytic anaemia, or\\nthrombocytopenia (<100,000/ μl), or leucopenia (>4,000/μ l).\\n10. Immunological derangements  seen as positive tests for anti-\\ndsDNA, antiSm, and/or anti-phospholipid antibody.11. Antinuclear antibodies seen as abnormal titre of ANA byimmunofluorescence or any other equivalent method.\\nThe disease usually runs a long course of flare-ups and\\nremissions; renal failure is the most frequent cause of death.\\nScleroderma (Progressive Systemic Sclerosis)\\nJust like SLE, scleroderma was initially described as a skin\\ndisease characterised by progressive fibrosis. But now, 2 maintypes are recognised:\\n1.Diffuse scleroderma  in which the skin shows widespread\\ninvolvement and may progress to involve visceral structures.\\n2.CREST syndrome  of progressive systemic sclerosis\\ncharacterised by Calcinosis (C), Raynaud’s phenomenon (R),\\nEsophageal hypomotility (E), Sclerodactyly (S) and\\nTelangiectasia (T).\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The etiology of this disease is not\\nknown. However, antinuclear antibodies are detected in\\nmajority of cases of systemic sclerosis. Immunologicmechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis oflesions in systemic sclerosis which finally cause activationof fibroblasts. The immune mechanisms  leading to stimulation\\nof fibroblasts may act in the following ways:\\n1.Elaboration of cytokines  such as by fibroblast growth factor\\nand chemotactic factors by activated T cells and\\nmacrophages.\\n2.Endothelial cell injury  due to cytotoxic damage to endo-\\nthelium from autoantibodies or antigen-antibody complexes.\\nThis results in aggregation and activation of platelets whichincreases vascular permeability and stimulates fibroblasticproliferation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Disseminated visceral\\ninvolvement as well as cutaneous lesions are seen insystemic sclerosis.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 4.9: Morphology of Major Lesions in SLE.\\n1.

The severity of disease varies from\\nmild to intermittent to severe and fulminant. Usually targetedorgans are musculoskeletal system, skin, kidneys, nervous81CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis1. Skin changes.

In advanced stage, the fingersbecome claw-like and face mask-like.\\nMicroscopically , changes are progressive from early to\\nlate stage.\\nEarly stage  shows oedema and degeneration of\\ncollagen. The small-sized blood vessels are occluded and\\nthere is perivascular infiltrate of mononuclear cells.\\nLate stage  reveals thin and flat epidermis. Dermis is\\nlargely replaced by compact collagen and there is hyalinethickening of walls of dermal blood vessels. In advancedcases subcutaneous calcification may occur.\\n2. Kidney changes.  Involvement of kidneys is seen in\\nmajority of cases of systemic sclerosis. The lesions are\\nprominent in the walls of interlobular arteries whichdevelop changes resembling malignant hypertension.There is thickening of tunica intima due to concentricproliferation of intimal cells and fibrinoid necrosis ofvessel wall.\\n3. Smooth muscle of GIT.  Muscularis of the alimentary\\ntract, particularly oesophagus, is progressively atrophied\\nand replaced by fibrous tissue.\\n4. Skeletal muscle.

There may be epithelium-lined honey-\\ncombed cysts of bronchioles.\\n7. Small arteries.  The lesions in small arteries show\\nendarteritis due to intimal proliferation and may be the\\ncause for Raynaud’s phenomenon.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Systemic sclerosis is more common\\nin middle-aged women. The clinical manifestations include:\\nclaw-like flexion deformity of hands;\\nRaynaud’s phenomenon;\\noesophageal fibrosis causing dysphagia and\\nhypomotility;\\nmalabsorption syndrome;\\nrespiratory distress;\\nmalignant hypertension;\\npulmonary hypertension; and\\nbiliary cirrhosis.\\nPolymyositis-Dermatomyositis\\nAs the name suggests, this disease is a combination of\\nsymmetric muscle weakness and skin rash.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The exact cause of the disease is\\nunknown. However, antinuclear antibodies are detected in\\n25% of cases. Thus, an immunologic hypothesis  has been\\nproposed. The affected muscles are infiltrated by sensitisedT lymphocytes of both T helper and T suppressor type whichare considered to bring about inflammatory destruction ofmuscle. Viral etiology  due to infection with coxsackie B virus\\nhas also been suggested.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The skeletal muscles\\nusually affected are of pelvis, shoulders, neck, chest anddiaphragm.Histologically,  vacuolisation and fragmentation of muscle\\nfibres and numerous inflammatory cells are present. Inlate stage, muscle fibres are replaced by fat and fibroustissue.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  It is a multi-system disease\\ncharacterised by:\\nmuscle weakness, mainly proximal;\\nskin rash, typically with heliotropic erythema and\\nperiorbital oedema;\\ndysphagia due to involvement of pharyngeal muscles;\\nrespiratory dysfunction; and\\nassociation with deep-seated malignancies.\\nSjögren’s Syndrome\\nSjögren’s syndrome is characterised by the triad  of dry eyes\\n(keratoconjunctivitis sicca) , dry mouth (xerostomia) , and\\nrheumatoid arthritis . The combination of the former two\\nsymptoms is called sicca syndrome .\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Immune mechanisms have been\\nimplicated in the etiopathogenesis of lesions in Sjögren’s\\nsyndrome. Antinuclear antibodies are found in about 90%of cases; test for rheumatoid factor is positive in 25% of cases.The lesions in lacrimal and salivary glands are mediated byT lymphocytes, B cells and plasma cells.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  In early stage , the lacrimal\\nand salivary glands show periductal infiltration bylymphocytes and plasma cells, which at times may formlymphoid follicles (pseudolymphoma). In late stage ,\\nglandular parenchyma is replaced by fat and fibroustissue. The ducts are also fibrosed and hyalinised.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The disease is common in women\\nin 4th to 6th decades of life. It is clinically characterised by:\\nSymptoms referable to eyes  such as blurred vision, burning\\nand itching.\\nSymptoms referable to xerostomia  such as fissured oral\\nmucosa, dryness, and difficulty in swallowing.\\nSymptoms due to glandular involvement  such as enlar-\\nged and inflamed lacrimal gland (Mikulicz’s syndrome isinvolvement of parotid alongwith lacrimal gland).\\nSymptoms due to systemic involvement  referable to lungs,\\nCNS and skin.\\nReiter’s Syndrome\\nThis syndrome is characterised by triad  of arthritis,\\nconjunctivitis  and urethritis . There may be mucocutaneous\\nlesions on palms, soles, oral mucosa and genitalia.\\nAntinuclear antibodies and RA factor are usually negative.82SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesAMYLOIDOSIS\\nAmyloidosis is the term used for a group of diseases charac-\\nterised by extracellular deposition of fibrillar proteinaceoussubstance called amyloid having common morphologicalappearance, staining properties and physical structure butwith variable protein (or biochemical) composition.\\nFirst described by Rokitansky in 1842, the substance was\\nsubsequently named by Virchow as ‘amyloid’ under themistaken belief that the material was starch-like ( amylon  =\\nstarch). This property was demonstrable grossly  on the cut\\nsurface of an organ containing amyloid which stained brown\\nwith iodine and turned violet on addition of dilute sulfuric\\nacid. By H&E staining under light microscopy,  amyloid\\nappears as extracellular, homogeneous, structureless and\\neosinophilic hyaline material; it stains positive with Congo red\\nstaining and shows apple-green birefringence on polarising\\nmicroscopy.\\nThe nomenclature of different forms of amyloid is done\\nby putting the alphabet A (A for amyloid), followed by thesuffix derived from the name of specific protein constitutingamyloid of that type e.g. AL (A for amyloid, L for light chain-derived), AA, ATTR etc.\\nPHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL NATURE OF AMYLOID\\nUltrastructural examination and chemical analysis reveal the\\ncomplex nature of amyloid. It emerges that on the basis of\\nmorphology and physical characteristics, all forms of amyloid aresimilar in appearance, but they are chemically heterogeneous.Based on these analysis, amyloid is composed of 2 main typesof complex proteins  (Fig. 4.9):\\nI.Fibril proteins  comprise about 95% of amyloid.II.Non-fibrillar components which include P-component\\npredominantly; there are several different proteins whichtogether constitute the remaining 5% of amyloid.\\nI. Fibril Proteins\\nBy electron microscopy, it became apparent that major\\ncomponent of all forms of amyloid (about 95%) consists ofmeshwork of fibril proteins. The fibrils  are delicate, randomly\\ndispersed, non-branching, each measuring 7.5-10 nm indiameter and having indefinite length. Each fibril is furthercomposed of double helix of two pleated sheets in the formof twin filaments  separated by a clear space. By X-ray\\ncrystallography and infra-red spectroscopy, the fibrils areshown to have cross-\\nβ-pleated sheet configuration which\\nproduces 1000 A° periodicity that gives the characteristicstaining properties of amyloid with Congo red andbirefringence under polarising microscopy. Based on thesefeatures amyloid is also referred to as \\nβ-fibrillosis .\\nChemical analysis  of fibril proteins of amyloid reveals\\nheterogeneous nature of amyloid. Chemically two majorforms of amyloid fibril proteins were first identified in 1970swhile currently  20 biochemically different proteins areknown to form amyloid fibrils in humans in differentclinicopathologic settings. Thus these proteins can becategorised as under:i) AL (amyloid light chain) proteinii) AA (amyloid associated) protein\\niii) Other proteins\\nAL PROTEIN.  AL amyloid fibril protein is derived from\\nimmunoglobulin light chain, which in most cases includes\\namino-terminal segment of the immunoglobulin light chain\\nFigure 4.9 Diagrammatic representation of the ultrastructure of amyloid. A, Electron microscopy shows major part consisting of amyloid fib rils\\n(95%) randomly oriented, while the minor part is essentially P-component (5%) B, Each fibril is further composed of double heli x of two pleated\\nsheets in the form of twin filaments  separated by a clear space. P-component has a pentagonal or doughnut profile. C, X-ray crystallography and\\ninfra-red spectroscopy shows fibrils having cross- β-pleated sheet configuration which produces periodicity that gives the characteristic staining\\nproperties of amyloid with Congo red and birefringence under polarising microscopy.\\n83CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including Amyloidosisand part of C region. AL fibril protein is more frequently\\nderived from the lambda ( λ) light chain than kappa ( κ), the\\nformer being twice more common. However, in any givencase, there is amino acid sequence homology.\\nAL type of fibril protein is produced by immunoglobulin-\\nsecreting cells and is therefore seen in association with plasma\\ncell dyscrasias and is included in primary systemic\\namyloidosis.\\nAA PROTEIN.  AA fibril protein is composed of protein with\\nmolecular weight of 8.5-kD which is derived from larger\\nprecursor protein in the serum called SAA (serum amyloid-associated protein) with a molecular weight of 12.5-kD .\\nUnlike AL amyloid, the deposits of AA amyloid do not havesequence homology. In the plasma, SAA circulates inassociation with HDL\\n3 (high-density lipoprotein). SAA is an\\nacute phase reactant protein synthesised in the liver, its levelbeing high in chronic inflammatory and traumatic conditions.\\nSAA fibril protein is found in secondary amyloidosis\\nwhich includes the largest group of diseases associated withamyloidosis.\\nOTHER PROTEINS.  Apart from the two major forms of\\namyloid fibril proteins, a few other forms of proteins are\\nfound in different clinical states:\\n1.Transthyretin (TTR). It is a serum protein synthesised\\nin the liver and trans ports thyroxine and  retin ol normally\\n(trans-thy-retin).  It was earlier called AFp (amyloid familial\\nprealbumin) since it precedes albumin (pre-albumin) onserum electrophoresis but is not related to serum albumin.Single amino acid substitution mutations in the structure ofTTR results in variant form of protein which is responsiblefor this form of amyloidosis termed as ATTR. About 60 suchmutations have been described.\\nATTR is the most common form of heredofamilial\\namyloidosis e.g. in familial amyloid polyneuropathies.However, the deposits of ATTR in the elderly primarilyinvolving the heart (senile cardiac amyloidosis) consists ofnormal TTR without any mutation. Another interestingaspect i n\\n ATTR is that despite being inherited, the disease\\nappears in middle age or elderly.\\n2. A β ββ ββ2-microglobulin (A β ββ ββ2M). This form of amyloid is seen\\nin cases of long-term haemodialysis (for 8-10 years). As the\\nname suggests,  β2M is a small protein which is a normal\\ncomponent of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) andhas β\\n -pleated sheet structure.  β2M is not effectively filtered\\nduring haemodialysis and thus there is high serumconcentration of  β\\n2M protein in these patients. Although\\nthe deposit due to A β2M may be systemic in distribution, it\\nhas  predilection for bones and joints.\\n3.β ββ ββ-amyloid protein (A β ββ ββ). Aβ is distinct from A β2M and is\\nseen in cerebral plaques as well as cerebral blood vessels in\\nAlzheimer’s disease. A β is derived from amyloid beta\\nprecursor protein (A βPP) which is a transmembrane\\nglycoprotein. The normal function of βPP is probably cell-\\nto-matrix signalling.\\n4. Immunoglobulin heavy chain amyloid (AH). AH is\\nderived from truncated heavy chain of immunoglobulin and\\nis an uncommon form of systemic amyloidosis.5. Amyloid from hormone precursor proteins.  It includes\\nexamples such as amyloid derived from pro-calcitonin(ACal), islet amyloid polypeptide (AIAPP, Amylin), pro-insulin (AIns), prolactin (APro), atrial natriuretic factor(AANF), and lactoferrin (ALac).\\n6. Amyloid of prion protein (APrP).  It is derived from\\nprecursor prion protein which is a plasma membrane\\nglycoprotein. Prion proteins are proteinaceous infectiousparticles lacking in RNA or DNA. Amyloid in prionosisoccurs due to abnormally folded isoform of the PrP.\\n7. Miscellaneous heredofamilial forms of amyloid.  This\\ngroup includes a variety of amyloid proteins reported\\nrecently. These are amyloid derived from: apolipoprotein I(AApoAI), gelsolin (AGel), lysozyme (ALys), fibrinogen α-\\nchain (AFib), lysozyme (ALys), cystatin C (ACys) andamyloid of familial dementia etc.\\nII. Non-fibrillar Components\\nNon-fibrillar components comprise about 5% of the amyloid\\nmaterial. These include the following:\\n1. Amyloid P (AP)-component.   It is synthesised in the liver\\nand is present in all types of amyloid. It is derived from\\ncirculating serum amyloid P-component, a glycoproteinresembling the normal serum α\\n1-glycoprotein and is PAS-\\npositive. It is structurally related to C-reactive protein, anacute phase reactant, but is not similar to it. By electronmicroscopy, it has a pentagonal profile (P-component) ordoughnut-shape with an external diameter of 9 nm andinternal diameter of 4 nm.\\n2. Apolipoprotein-E (apoE).  It is a regulator of lipoprotein\\nmetabolism and is found in all types of amyloid. One allele,\\napoE4, increases the risk of Alzheimer precursor protein(APP) deposition in Alzheimer’s disease but not in all othertypes of amyloid deposits.\\n3. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans(GAGs).  These are\\nconstituents of matrix proteins; particularly associated is\\nheparan sulfate in all types of tissue amyloid.\\n4.α αα αα-1 anti-chymotrypsin.  It is seen in cases of  AA deposits\\nonly but not seen in primary amyloidosis.\\n5. Protein X . This protein has been shown to be present in\\ncases of prionoses .\\n6. Other components . Besides above, components of\\ncomplement, proteases, and membrane constituents may be\\nseen.\\nPATHOGENESIS OF AMYLOIDOSIS\\nThe earliest observation that amyloidosis developed in\\nexperimental animals who were injected repeatedly withantigen to raise antisera for human use led to the conceptthat amyloidogenesis was the result of immunologicmechanisms. AL variety of amyloid protein was thus first tobe isolated. It is now appreciated that amyloidosis orfibrillogenesis is multifactorial and that different mechanismsare involved in different types of amyloid.\\nIrrespective of the type of amyloid, amyloidogenesis in\\ngeneral in vivo , occurs in the following sequence  (Fig. 4.10):84SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\n1.Pool of amyloidogenic precursor  protein  is present in\\ncirculation in different clinical settings and in response to\\nstimuli e.g. increased hepatic synthesis of AA or ATTR,increased synthesis of AL etc.\\n2.A nidus for fibrillogenesis , meaning thereby an alteration\\nin microenvironment, to stimulate deposition of amyloid\\nprotein is formed. This alteration involves changes andinteraction between basement membrane proteins  andamyloidogenic protein.\\n3.Partial degradation or proteolysis  occurs prior to deposition\\nof fibrillar protein which may occur in macrophages or\\nreticuloendothelial cells e.g. partial degradation of AL, AA.\\n4. Exceptions to this generalisation, however, are seen in ATTR\\n(heredofamilial type in which there are amino acid mutations\\nin most cases), A β2M (in which there are elevated levels of\\nnormal β2M protein which remain unfiltered duringhaemodialysis) and prionosis (in which β-pleated sheet is\\nformed de novo ).\\n5. The role of non-fibrillar components  such as AP, apoE and\\nGAGs in amyloidosis is unclear; probably they facilitate inaggregation of proteins and protein folding leading to fibrilformation, substrate adhesion and protection fromdegradation.\\nBased on this general pathogenesis, deposition of AL and\\nAA amyloid is briefly outlined below:\\nDeposition of AL Amyloid\\n1. The stimulus for production of AL amyloid is some\\ndisorder of immunoglobulin synthesis  e.g. multiple myeloma,\\nB cell lymphoma, other plasma cell dyscrasias.\\n2.Excessive immunoglobulin production is in the form of\\nmonoclonal gammopathy  i.e. there is production of either intactFigure 4.10 Pathogenesis of two main forms of amyloid deposition (AL = Amyloid light chain; AA = Amyloid-associated protein; GAG =\\nglycosaminoglycan; AP = Amyloid P component). The sequence on left shows general schematic representation common to both major forms of\\namyloidogenesis.\\n85CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including Amyloidosisimmunoglobulin, or λ light chain, or κ light chain, or rarely\\nheavy chains. This takes place by monoclonal proliferation\\nof plasma cells, B lymphocytes, or their precursors.\\n3.Partial degradation  in the form of limited proteolysis of\\nlarger protein molecules occurs in macrophages that are\\nanatomically closely associated with AL amyloid.\\n4. Non-fibrillar components  like AP and GAGs play some role\\nin folding and aggregation of fibril proteins.\\nDeposition of AA Amyloid\\n1. AA amyloid is directly related to SAA levels,  a high-\\ndensity lipoprotein. SAA is synthesised by the liver in\\nresponse to cytokines , notably interleukin 1 and 6, released\\nfrom activated macrophages.2. The levels of SAA are elevated in long-standing tissue\\ndestruction  e.g. in chronic inflammation, cancers. However,\\nSAA levels in isolation do not always lead to AA amyloid.3\\n. As in AL amyloid, partial degradation  in the form of limited\\nproteolysis takes place in reticuloendothelial cells.4. In AA amyloid, a significant role is played by another\\nglycoprotein, amyloid enhancing  factor (AEF) . The exact\\ncomposition of AEF is not known. AEF is elaborated inchronic inflammation, cancer and familial Mediterranean\\nfever. On the basis of experimental induction of AA amyloid,AEF has been shown to accelerate AA amyloid deposition.\\nPossibly, AEF acts as a nidus for deposition of fibrils in AA\\namyloid.\\n5. As in AL amyloid, there is a role of AP component  and\\nglycosaminoglycans  in the fibril protein aggregation and to\\nprotect it from disaggregation again.\\nCLASSIFICATION OF AMYLOIDOSIS\\nOver the years, amyloidosis has been classified in a number\\nof ways:Based on cause , into primary (with unknown cause and\\nthe deposition is in the disease itself) and secondary  (as a\\ncomplication of some underlying known disease)amyloidosis.\\nBased on extent of amyloid deposition , into systemic\\n(generalised)  involving multiple organs and localised\\namyloidosis  involving one or two organs or sites.\\nBased on histological basis , into pericollagenous  (corres-\\nponding in distribution to primary amyloidosis), andperireticulin  (corresponding in distribution to secondary\\namyloidosis).\\nBased on clinical location, into pattern I  (involving\\ntongue, heart, bowel, skeletal and smooth muscle, skin andnerves), pattern II  (principally involving liver, spleen, kidney\\nand adrenals) and mixed pattern (involving sites of both\\npattern I and II).\\nBased on tissues  in which amyloid is deposited, into\\nmesenchymal  (organs derived from mesoderm) and\\nparenchymal  (organs derived from ectoderm and endoderm)\\namyloidosis.\\nBased on precursor biochemical proteins , into specific\\ntype of serum amyloid proteins.\\nWith availability of biochemical composition of various\\nforms of amyloid and diverse clinical settings in which thesespecific biochemical forms of amyloid are deposited, aclinicopathologic classification  has been proposed which is\\nwidely acceptable (Table 4.10).   According to this\\nclassification, amyloidosis can be divided into 2 majorcategories and their subtypes depending upon clinicalsettings:\\nA.Systemic (generalised) amyloidosis:\\n1.\\nPrimary (AL)\\n2.

Tumour-forming (AL)\\nA. SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSIS\\n1.Primary Systemic (AL) \\nAmyloidosis\\nPrimary amyloidosis consisting of AL fibril proteins is\\nsystemic or generalised in distribution.  About 30% cases ofAL amyloid have some form of plasma cell dyscrasias, mostcommonly multiple myeloma (in about 10% cases), and lessoften other monoclonal gammopathies such asWaldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, heavy chain disease,solitary plasmacytoma and nodular malignant lymphoma(B cell lymphoma). The neoplastic plasma cells usually are asingle clone and, therefore, produce the same type ofimmunoglobulin light chain or part of light chain. Almostall cases of multiple myeloma have either λ or κ light chains\\n(Bence Jones proteins) in the serum and are excreted in theurine. However, in contrast to normal or myeloma lightchains, AL is twice more frequently derived from λ light\\nchains.\\nThe remaining 70% cases of AL amyloid do not have\\nevident B-cell proliferative disorder or any other associateddiseases and are thus cases of true ‘primary’ (idiopathic)amyloidosis. However, by more sensitive methods, someplasma cell dyscrasias are detectable in virtually all patientswith AL. Majority of these cases too have a single type ofabnormal immunoglobulin in their serum (monoclonal) andthat these patients have some degree of plasmacytosis in thebone marrow, suggesting the origin of AL amyloid fromprecursor plasma cells.\\nAL amyloid is most prevalent type of systemic\\namyloidosis in North America and Europe and is seen inindividuals past the age of 40 years. Primary amyloidosis isoften severe in the heart, kidney, bowel, skin, peripheralnerves, respiratory tract, skeletal muscle, and other organs.\\nRecently, it has been possible to reproduce AL amyloid\\nin mice by repeated injections of human amyloidogenic lightchains. Treatment of AL amyloid is targetted at reducing theunderlying clonal expansion of plasma cells.\\n2. Secondary/Reactive (AA) Systemic Amyloidosis\\nThe second form of systemic or generalised amyloidosis is\\nreactive or inflammatory or secondary in which the fibrilproteins contain AA amyloid. Secondary or reactiveamyloidosis occurs typically as a complication of chronicinfectious (e.g. tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, chronicosteomyelitis, chronic pyelonephritis, leprosy, chronic skininfections), non-infectious chronic inflammatory conditionsassociated with tissue destruction (e.g. autoimmunedisorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory boweldisease), some tumours (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin’sdisease) and in familial Mediterranean fever, an inheriteddisorder (discussed below).\\nSecondary amyloidosis is typically distributed in solid\\nabdominal viscera like the kidney, liver, spleen and adrenals.Secondary reactive amyloidosis is seen less frequently indeveloped countries due to containment of infections beforethey become chronic but this is the more common type ofamyloidosis in underdeveloped and developing countriesof the world. Secondary systemic amyloidosis can occur atany age including children.\\nAA amyloid occurs spontaneously in some birds\\nand animals; it can also be experimentally induced in\\nanimals.\\nThe contrasting features of the two main forms of\\nsystemic amyloidosis are given in Table 4.11.\\n3.Haemodialysis-Associated (Ab2M) Amyloidosis\\nPatients on long-term dialysis for more than 10 years forchronic renal failure may develop systemic amyloidosisderived from β\\n2-microglobulin which is normal component\\nof MHC.

However, systemic distribution has alsobeen observed in these cases showing bulky visceral depositsof amyloid.\\n4. Heredofamilial Amyloidosis\\nA few rare examples of genetically-determined amyloidosis\\nhaving familial occurrence and seen in certain geographicregions have been described. These are as under:\\ni) Hereditary polyneuropathic (ATTR) amyloidosis.  This\\nis an autosomal dominant disorder in which amyloid is\\ndeposited in the peripheral and autonomic nerves resultingin muscular weakness, pain and paraesthesia, or may havecardiomyopathy. This type of amyloid is derived fromtransthyretin (ATTR) with single amino acid substitution inthe structure of TTR; about 60 types of such mutations havebeen described. Though hereditary, the condition appearswell past middle life.\\nii) Amyloid in familial Mediterranean fever (AA).  This is\\nan autosomal recessive disease and is seen in the\\nMediterranean region (i.e. people residing in the countriessurrounding the Mediterranean sea e.g. Sephardic Jews,Armenians, Arabs and Turks). The condition is characterisedby periodic attacks of fever and polyserositis i.e.inflammatory involvement of the pleura, peritoneum, andsynovium causing pain in the chest, abdomen and jointsrespectively. Amyloidosis occurring in these cases is\\n AA\\ntype, suggesting relationship to secondary amyloidosis due\\nto chronic inflammation. The distribution of this form ofheredofamilial amyloidosis is similar to that of secondaryamyloidosis.\\niii) Rare hereditary forms.  Heredofamilial mutations of\\nseveral normal proteins have been reported e.g. apolipo-\\nprotein I (AApoAI), gelsolin (AGel), lysozyme (ALys),fibrinogen α-chain (AFib), cystatin C (ACys) and amyloid of\\nfamilial dementia etc. These types may also result in systemicamyloidosis.\\nB. LOCALISED AMYLOIDOSIS\\n1.Senile cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR).  Senile cardiac amy-\\nloidosis is seen in 50% of people above the age of 70 years.\\nThe deposits are seen in the heart and aorta. The type ofamyloid in these cases is ATTR but without any change inthe protein structure of TTR.\\n2. Senile cerebral amyloidosis (A β \\nββ ββ, APrP). Senile cerebral\\namyloidosis is heterogeneous group of amyloid deposition\\nof varying etiologies that includes sporadic, familial,hereditary and infectious. Some of the important diseasesassociated with cerebral amyloidosis and the correspondingamyloid proteins are: Alzheimer’s disease (A β), Down’s\\nsyndrome (A β) and transmissible spongiform encephalo-\\npathies (APrP) such as in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatalfamilial insomnia, mad cow disease, kuru.\\nIn Alzheimer’s disease, deposit of amyloid is seen as\\nCongophilic angiopathy (amyloid material in the walls of\\ncerebral blood vessels),  neurofibrillary tangles and in senileplaques.3. Endocrine amyloidosis (Hormone precursors).  Some\\nendocrine lesions are associated with microscopic depositsof amyloid. The examples are as follows:\\ni)  Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (from procalcitonin\\ni.e. ACal).\\nii) Islet cell tumour of the pancreas (from islet amyloid\\npolypeptide i.e. AIAPP or Amylin).\\niii) Type 2 diabetes mellitus (from pro-insulin, i.e. AIns).\\niv) Pituitary amyloid (from prolactin i.e. APro).\\nv) Isolated atrial amyloid deposits (from atrial natriuretic\\nfactor i.e. AANF).\\nvi) Familial corneal amyloidosis (from lactoferrin i.e. ALac).\\n4. Localised tumour forming amyloid (AL).  Sometimes,\\nisolated tumour like formation of amyloid deposits are seen\\ne.g. in lungs, larynx, skin, urinary bladder, tongue, eye,isolated atrial amyloid. In most of these cases, the amyloidtype is AL.\\nSTAINING CHARACTERISTICS OF AMYLOID\\n1. STAIN ON GROSS. The oldest method since the time of\\nVirchow for demonstrating amyloid on cut surface of a gross\\nspecimen, or on the frozen/paraffin section is iodine stain.Lugol’s iodine imparts mahogany brown colour to the amyloid-\\ncontaining area which on addition of dilute sulfuric acid turnsblue. This starch-like property of amyloid is due to AP\\ncomponent, a glycoprotein, present in all forms of amyloid.\\nVarious stains and techniques employed to distinguish\\nand confirm amyloid deposits in sections are as given in\\nTable 4.12.\\n2.H & E.  Amyloid by light microscopy with haematoxylin\\nand eosin staining appears as extracellular, homogeneous,\\nstructureless and eosinophilic hyaline material, especially inrelation to blood vessels. However, if the deposits are small,they are difficult to detect by routine H and E stains. Besides,a few other hyaline deposits may also take pink colour (page35).\\n3.METACHROMATIC STAINS (ROSANILINE DYES).\\nAmyloid has the property of metachromasia i.e. the dye\\nreacts with amyloid and undergoes a colour change.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 4.12: Staining Characteristics of Amyloid.\\nStain Appearance\\n1. \\nH & E Pink, hyaline, homogeneous\\n2.

Non-specific stains:\\n i) Standard toluidine blue Orthochromatic blue,polarising ME dark red\\nii) Alcian blue Blue-green\\niii) PAS Pink88SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesMetachromatic stains employed are rosaniline dyes such as\\nmethyl violet and crystal violet which impart rose-pink\\ncolouration to amyloid deposits. However, small amountsof amyloid are missed, mucins also have metachromasia andthat aqueous mountants are required for seeing thepreparation.  Therefore, this method has low sensitivity andlacks specificity.\\n4. CONGO RED AND POLARISED LIGHT.  All types of\\namyloid have affinity for Congo red stain; therefore this\\nmethod is used for confirmation of amyloid of all types. Thestain may be used on both gross specimens and microscopicsections; amyloid of all types stains pink red colour . If the\\nstained section is viewed in polarised light, the amyloidcharacteristically shows apple-green  birefringence  due to cross-\\nβ-pleated sheet configuration of amyloid fibrils. The stain\\ncan also be used to distinguish between AL and AA amyloid(primary and secondary amyloid respectively). After priortreatment with permanganate or trypsin on the section,Congo red stain is repeated—in the case of primary amyloid(AL amyloid), the Congo red positivity (congophilia)persists,* while it turns negative for Congo red in secondaryamyloid (AA amyloid). Congo red dye can also be used asan in vivo  test (described below).\\n5. FLUORESCENT STAINS.  Fluorescent stain thioflavin-\\nT binds to amyloid and fluoresce yellow  under ultraviolet\\nlight i.e. amyloid emits secondary fluorescence. Thioflavin-S is less specific.\\n6. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY.  More recently, type of\\namyloid can be classified by immunohistochemical stains.\\nVarious antibody stains against the specific antigenicprotein types of amyloid are commercially available.However, most useful in confirmation for presence ofamyloid of any type is anti-AP stain ; others for determining\\nthe biochemical type of amyloid include  anti-AA , anti-lambda\\n(\\nλ), anti- kappa ( κ) antibody stains etc.\\n7. NON-SPECIFIC STAINS. A few other stains have been\\ndescribed for amyloid at different times but they lackspecificity. These are as under:\\ni) Standard toluidine blue: This method gives orthochromatic\\nblue colour to amyloid which under polarising microscopy\\nproduces dark red  birefringence. However, there are false\\npositive as well as false negative results; hence not\\nrecommended.\\nii) Alcian blue: It imparts blue-green  colour to amyloid\\npositive areas and is used for mucopolysaccharide content\\nin amyloid but uptake of dye is poor and variable.\\niii) Periodic acid Schiff (PAS): It is used for demonstration\\nof  carbohydrate content of amyloid but shows variable\\npositivity and is not specific.\\nDIAGNOSIS OF AMYLOIDOSIS\\nAmyloidosis may be detected as an unsuspected morpho-\\nlogic finding in a case, or the changes may be severe so as toproduce symptoms and may even cause death. The diagnosisof amyloid disease can be made from the followinginvestigations:\\n1. BIOPSY EXAMINATION.  Histologic examination of\\nbiopsy material is the commonest and confirmatory method\\nfor diagnosis in a suspected case of amyloidosis. Biopsy ofan obviously affected organ  is likely to offer the best results\\ne.g. kidney biopsy in a case of dialysis, sural nerve biopsy in\\nfamilial polyneuropathy. In systemic amyloidosis, renalbiopsy provides the best detection rate, but rectal biopsy  also\\nhas a good pick up rate. However, gingiva and skin biopsy\\nhave poor result. Currently, fine needle aspiration ofabdominal subcutaneous fat followed by Congo red staining\\nand polarising microscopic examination for confirmation hasbecome an acceptable simple and useful technique withexcellent result.\\n2. IN VIVO CONGO RED TEST . A known quantity of\\nCongo red dye may be injected intravenously in living\\npatient. If amyloidosis is present, the dye gets bound toamyloid deposits and its levels in blood rapidly decline. The\\ntest is, however, not popular due to the risk of anaphylaxis\\nto the injected dye.\\n3. OTHER TESTS.  A few other tests which are not\\ndiagnostic but are supportive of amyloid disease are protein\\nelectrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis of urine and serum,\\nand bone marrow aspiration.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF\\nAMYLOIDOSIS OF ORGANS\\nAlthough amyloidosis of different organs shows variation\\nin morphologic pattern, some features are applicable in\\ngeneral to most of the involved organs.\\nSites of Amyloid Deposits.  In general, amyloid proteins get\\nfiltered from blood across the basement membrane of\\nvascular capillaries into extravascular spaces.  Thus, mostcommonly amyloid deposits appear at the contacts between\\nthe vascular spaces and parenchymal cells, in the\\nFigure 4.11 Amyloidosis of kidney. The kidney is small and pale in\\ncolour. Sectioned surface shows loss of cortico-medullary distinction\\n(arrow) and pale, waxy translucency.*Easy way to remember: Three ps i.e. there is persistence of\\ncongophilia after p ermanganate treatment in p rimary amyloid.89CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis\\nextracellular matrix and within the basement membranes of\\nblood vessels.\\nGrossly,  the affected organ is usually enlarged, pale and\\nrubbery. Cut surface shows firm, waxy and translucentparenchyma which takes positive staining with the iodine\\ntest.\\nMicroscopically,  the deposits of amyloid are found in the\\nextracellular locations, initially in the walls of small blood\\nvessels producing microscopic changes and effects, while\\nlater the deposits are in large amounts causing\\nmacroscopic changes and effects of pressure atrophy.\\nBased on these general features of amyloidosis, the salient\\npathologic findings of major organ involvements are\\ndescribed below.\\nAmyloidosis of Kidneys\\nAmyloidosis of the kidneys is most common and most\\nserious because of ill-effects on renal function. The depositsin the kidneys are found in most cases of secondary\\namyloidosis and in about one-third cases of primary\\namyloidosis. Amyloidosis of the kidney accounts for about20% of deaths from amyloidosis. Even small quantities ofamyloid deposits in the glomeruli can cause protein uria and\\nnephrotic syndrome.\\nGrossly , the kidneys may be normal-sized, enlarged or\\nterminally contracted due to ischaemic effect of narrowing\\nof vascular lumina. Cut surface is pale, waxy andtranslucent (Fig. 4.11) .\\nMicroscopically,  amyloid deposition occurs primarily in\\nthe glomeruli, though it may involve peritubularinterstitial tissue and the walls of arterioles as well(Fig. 4.12):\\nIn the glomeruli , the deposits initially appear on the\\nbasement membrane of the glomerular capillaries, butlater extend to produce luminal narrowing and distortionof the glomerular capillary tuft. This results in abnormalincrease in permeability of the glomerular capillaries tomacromolecules with consequent proteinuria andnephrotic syndrome.\\nIn the tubules,  the amyloid deposits likewise begin close\\nto the tubular epithelial basement membrane. Subse-quently, the deposits may extend further outwards intothe intertubular connective tissue, and inwards to producedegenerative changes in the tubular epithelial cells andamyloid casts in the tubular lumina.\\nVascular involvement  affects chiefly the walls of small\\narterioles and venules, producing narrowing of theirlumina and consequent ischaemic effects.Figure 4.12 Amyloidosis of kidney. The amyloid deposits are seen mainly in the glomerular capillary tuft. The deposits are also present in\\nperitubular connective tissue producing atrophic tubules and amyloid casts in the tubular lumina, and in the arterial wall prod ucing luminal narrowing.\\nFigure 4.13 Amyloidosis kidney, Congo red stain. A, The amyloid\\ndeposits are seen mainly in the glomerular capillary tuft stained red-pink\\n(Congophilia). B, Viewing the same under polarising microscopy, thecongophilic areas show apple-green birefringence.\\n90SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nCongo red staining  showing red pink colour and\\npolarising microscopy showing apple-green birefringence\\nconfirms the presence of amyloid (Fig. 4.13).\\nAmyloidosis of Spleen\\nAmyloid deposition in the spleen, for some unknownreasons, may have one of the following two patterns(Fig. 4.14):\\n1.SAGO SPLEEN.  The splenomegaly is not marked and\\ncut surface shows characteristic translucent pale and waxynodules resembling sago grains and hence the name.Microscopically,  the amyloid deposits begin in the walls\\nof the arterioles of the white pulp and may subsequentlyreplace the follicles.\\n2\\n. LARDACEOUS SPLEEN.  There is generally moderate\\nto marked splenomegaly (weight up to 1 kg). Cut surface\\nof the spleen shows map-like areas of amyloid(lardaceous-lard-like; lard means fat of pigs) (Fig. 4.15).\\nMicroscopically,  the deposits involve the walls of splenic\\nsinuses and the small arteries and in the connective tissueof the red pulp (Fig. 4.16).  Confirmation is by seeing\\nCongophilia in Congo Red staining and demonstrationof apple-green birefringence under polarising microscopyin the corresponding positive areas.\\nAmyloidosis of Liver\\nIn about half the cases of systemic amyloidosis, liver\\ninvolvement by amyloidosis is seen.Grossly,  the liver is often enlarged, pale, waxy and firm.\\nHistologically,  the features are as under (Fig. 4.17):\\nThe amyloid initially appears in the space of Disse\\n(the space between the hepatocytes and sinusoidalendothelial cells).\\nFigure 4.14 Gross patterns of amyloidosis of the spleen.\\nFigure 4.15 Lardaceous amyloidosis of the spleen. The sectioned\\nsurface shows presence of plae waxy translucency in a map-like pattern.\\n91CHAPTER 4 Immunopathology Including Amyloidosis\\nFigure 4.16 Amyloidosis spleen. A, The pink acellular amyloid material is seen in the red pulp causing atrophy of while pulp. B, Congo red\\nstaining shows Congophilia as seen by red-pink colour. C, When viewed under polarising microscopy the corresponding area shows apple-green\\nbirefringence.\\nFigure 4.17 Amyloidosis of the liver. A, The deposition is extensive\\nin the space of Disse causing compression and pressure atrophy of\\nhepatocytes. B, Congo red staining shows congophilia which under\\npolarising microscopy. C, shows apple-green birefringence.\\nLater, as the deposits increases, they compress the\\ncords of hepatocytes so that eventually the liver cells\\nare shrunken and atrophic and replaced by amyloid.However, hepatic function remains normal even at anadvanced stage of the disease.\\nTo a lesser extent, portal tracts and Kupffer cells are\\ninvolved in amyloidosis.\\n92SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesAmyloidosis of Heart\\nHeart is involved in systemic amyloidosis quite commonly,\\nmore so in the primary than in secondary systemicamyloidosis. It may also be involved in localised form ofamyloidosis (senile cardiac and AANF). In advanced cases,there may be a pressure atrophy of the myocardial fibres andimpaired ventricular function which may produce restrictivecardiomyopathy. Amyloidosis of the heart may producearrhythmias due to deposition in the conduction system.\\nGrossly,  the heart may be enlarged. The external surface\\nis pale, translucent and waxy. The epicardium,\\nendocardium and valves show tiny nodular deposits orraised plaques of amyloid.Microscopically, the changes are as under:\\nAmyloid deposits are seen in and around the\\ncoronaries and their small branches.\\nIn cases of primary amyloidosis of the heart, the\\ndeposits of AL amyloid are seen around the myocardialfibres in ring-like formations (ring fibres).\\nIn localised form of amyloid of the heart, the deposits\\nare seen in the left atrium and in the interatrial septum.\\nAmyloidosis of Alimentary Tract\\nInvolvement of the gastrointestinal tract by amyloidosis may\\noccur at any level from the oral cavity to the anus. Rectaland gingival biopsies are the common sites for diagnosis ofsystemic amyloidosis. The deposits are initially locatedaround the small blood vessels but later may involve adjacentlayers of the bowel wall. Tongue may be the site for tumour-forming amyloid, producing macroglossia.\\nOther Organs\\nUncommonly, the deposits of amyloid may occur in various\\nother tissues such as pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, skin, lymphnodes, respiratory tract and peripheral and autonomicnerves.\\nPROGNOSIS OF AMYLOIDOSIS\\nAmyloidosis may be an incidental finding at autopsy or in\\nsymptomatic cases diagnosis can be made from the methodsgiven above, biopsy examination being the most importantmethod. The prognosis of patients with generalisedamyloidosis is generally poor. Primary amyloidosis, if leftuntreated, is rapidly progressive and fatal. Therapy in thesecases is directed at reducing the clonal marrow plasma cellsas is done for treatment of multiple myeloma. For secondaryreactive amyloidosis, control of inflammation is the mainstayof treatment. Secondary amyloidosis has somewhat betteroutcome due to controllable underlying condition.\\nRenal failure and cardiac arrhythmias are the most\\ncommon causes of death in most cases of systemicamyloidosis.\\n❑93CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics\\nChapter 5Derangements of Homeostasis\\nand HaemodynamicsChapter 5\\nHOMEOSTASIS\\nMany workers have pointed out that life on earth probably\\narose in the sea, and that the body water which is theenvironment of the cells, consisting of “salt water” is similarto the ancient ocean. The sea within us flows through bloodand lymph vessels, bathes the cells as well as lies within thecells. However, water within us contains several salts thatincludes sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium,phosphate, and other electrolytes. Although it appears quitetempting to draw comparison between environment of thecell and the ancient oceans, it would be rather anoversimplification in considering the cellular environmentto be wholly fluid ignoring the presence of cells, fibres andground substance.\\nClaude Bernarde (1949) first coined the term internal\\nenvironment or milieu interieur  for the state in the body in\\nwhich the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells and theplasma, together maintain the normal morphology andfunction of the cells and tissues of the body. The mechanismby which the constancy of the internal environment ismaintained and ensured is called the homeostasis.  For this\\npurpose, living membranes with varying permeabilities suchas vascular endothelium and the cell wall play importantrole in exchange of fluids, electrolytes, nutrients andmetabolites across the compartments of body fluids.\\nThe normal composition of internal environment consists\\nof the following components  (Fig. 5.1):\\n1.WATER.  Water is the principal and essential constituent\\nof the body. The total body water in a normal adult malecomprises 50-70% (average 60%) of the body weight andabout 10% less in a normal adult female (average 50%). Thus,the body of a normal male weighing 65 kg containsapproximately 40 litres of water. The total body water(assuming average of 60%) is distributed into 2 maincompartments of body fluids separated from each other bymembranes freely permeable to water. These are as under(Fig. 5.2):\\ni) Intracellular fluid compartment.  This comprises about\\n33% of the body weight, the bulk of which is contained in\\nthe muscles.\\nii) Extracellular fluid compartment.  This constitutes the\\nremaining 27% of body weight containing water. Included\\nin this are the following 4 subdivisions of extracellular fluid(ECF):\\na)Interstitial fluid including lymph fluid  constitutes the major\\nproportion of ECF (12% of body weight).b\\n) Intravascular fluid or blood plasma  comprises about 5% of\\nthe body weight. Thus plasma content is about 3 litres of\\nfluid out of 5 litres of total blood volume.\\nc) Mesenchymal tissues  such as dense connective tissue,\\ncartilage and bone contain body water that comprises about\\n9% of the body weight.\\nd) Transcellular fluid  constitutes 1% of body weight. This is\\nthe fluid contained in the secretions of secretory cells of the\\nbody e.g. skin, salivary glands, mucous membranes ofalimentary and respiratory tracts, pancreas, liver and biliarytract, kidneys, gonads, thyroid, lacrimal gland and CSF.\\n2. ELECTROLYTES.  The concentration of cations\\n(positively charged) and anions (negatively charged) is\\ndifferent in intracellular and extracellular fluids:\\nFigure 5.1 Distribution of body fluid compartments.Figure 5.2 Body fluid compartments (ICF = intracellular fluid\\ncompartment; ECF = extracellular fluid compartment).\\n94SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesIn the intracellular fluid,  the main cations are potassium\\nand magnesium and the main anions are phosphates and\\nproteins. It has low concentration of sodium and chloride.\\nIn the extracellular fluid, the predominant cation is sodium\\nand the principal anions are chloride and bicarbonate. Besidesthese, a small proportion of non-diffusible proteins and some\\ndiffusible nutrients and metabolites such as glucose and urea\\nare present in the ECF.\\nThe essential difference between the two main sub-\\ndivisions of ECF is the higher protein content in the plasmathan in the interstitial fluid which plays an important role inmaintaining fluid balance.\\nThe major functions  of electrolytes are as follows:\\ni) Electrolytes are the main solutes in the body fluids for\\nmaintenance of acid-base equilibrium.\\nii) Electrolytes maintain the proper osmolality and volume\\nof body fluids ( Osmolality  is the solute concentration per kg\\nwater, compared from osmolarity  which is the solute\\nconcentration per litre solution).\\niii) The concentration of certain electrolytes determines theirspecific physiologic functions e.g. the effect of calcium ionson neuromuscular excitability. The concentration of the majorelectrolytes is expressed in milliequivalent (mEq) per litreso as to compare the values directly with each other. In orderto convert mg per dl into mEq per litre the following formulais used:\\n mg/dl\\nmEq/L = _____________________ × 10\\n    Eq weight of element\\nNORMAL WATER AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE(GIBBS-DONNAN EQUILIBRIUM)\\nNormally, a state of balance exists between the amount of\\nwater absorbed into the body and that which is eliminatedfrom the body. The water as well as electrolytes aredistributed nearly constantly in different body fluid\\ncompartments:\\n1.Water is normally absorbed  into the body from the bowel\\nor is introduced parenterally; average intake being 2800 ml\\nper day.\\n2. Water is eliminated  from the body via:\\nkidneys in the urine (average 1500 ml per day);\\nvia the skin as insensible loss in perspiration or as sweat\\n(average 800 ml per day), though there is wide variation in\\nloss via sweat depending upon weather, temperature, feverand exercise;\\nvia the lungs in exhaled air (average 400 ml per day);\\nand\\nminor losses via the faeces (average 100 ml per day) and\\nlacrimal, nasal, oral, sexual and mammary (milk) secretions.\\nThe cell wall as well as capillary endothelium are enti-\\nrely permeable to water but they differ in their permeabilityto electrolytes. Capillary wall is completely permeable toelectrolytes while the cell membrane is somewhatimpermeable. As mentioned earlier, concentration ofpotassium and phosphate are high in the intracellular fluid\\nwhereas concentration of sodium and chloride are high inthe ECF. The osmotic equilibrium between the two majorbody fluid compartments is maintained by the passage ofwater from or into the intracellular compartment. The 2 main\\nsubdivisions of ECF—blood plasma and interstitial fluid, are\\nseparated from each other by capillary wall which is freelypermeable to water but does not allow free passage of macro-molecules of plasma proteins resulting in higher proteincontent in the plasma.\\nACID-BASE BALANCE\\nBesides changes in the volume of fluids in the compartments,\\nchanges in ionic equilibrium affecting the acid-base balanceof fluids occur. In terms of body fluids,\\nan acid is a molecule or ion which is capable of giving off\\na hydrogen ion (H+ ion donor); and\\na base is a molecule or ion which is capable of taking up\\nhydrogen ion (H+ ion acceptor).\\nA number of acids such as carbonic, phosphoric, sulfuric,\\nlactic, hydrochloric and ketoacids are formed during normalmetabolic activity. However, carbonic acid is produced inlargest amount as it is the end-product of aerobic tissue\\nactivity. In spite of these acids, the pH of the blood is kept\\nconstant at 7.4 \\n+ 0.05 in health.\\nThe pH of blood and acid-base balance are regulated in\\nthe body as follows.\\n1. BUFFER SYSTEM.  Buffers are substances which have\\nweak acids and strong bases and limit the change in H+ ion\\nconcentration to the normal range. They are the first line of\\ndefense for maintaining acid-base balance and do so bytaking up H\\n+ ions when the pH rises. The most important\\nbuffer which regulates the pH of blood is bicarbonate-carbonic\\nacid system  followed by intracellular buffering action of\\nhaemoglobin  and carbonic anhydrase  in the red cells.\\n2. PULMONARY MECHANISM.  During respiration, CO2\\nis removed by the lungs depending upon the partial pressure\\nof CO2 in the arterial blood. With ingestion of high quantity\\nof acid-forming salts, ventilation is increased as seen in\\nacidosis in diabetic ketosis and uraemia.\\n3. RENAL MECHANISM.  The other route by which H+\\nions can be excreted from the body is in the urine. Here, H+\\nions secreted by the renal tubular cells are buffered in the\\nglomerular filtrate by:\\ncombining with phosphates  to form phosphoric acid;\\ncombining with ammonia  to form ammonium ions; and\\ncombining with filtered bicarbonate ions  to form carbonic\\nacid.\\nHowever, carbonic acid formed is dissociated to form CO2\\nwhich diffuses back into the blood to reform bicarbonate ions.\\nPRESSURE GRADIENTS AND FLUID EXCHANGES\\nAside from water and electrolytes or crystalloids, both of\\nwhich are freely interchanged between the interstitial fluidand plasma, the ECF contains colloids (i.e. proteins) whichminimally cross the capillary wall. These substances exertpressures responsible for exchange between the interstitialfluid and plasma.95CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and HaemodynamicsNormal Fluid Pressures\\n1. OSMOTIC PRESSURE.  This is the pressure exerted by\\nthe chemical constituents of the body fluids. Accordingly,\\nosmotic pressure may be of the following types (Fig. 5.3,A):\\nCrystalloid osmotic pressure  exerted by electrolytes\\npresent in the ECF and comprises the major portion of thetotal osmotic pressure.\\nColloid osmotic pressure (Oncotic pressure)  exerted by\\nproteins present in the ECF and constitutes a small part ofthe total osmotic pressure but is more significantphysiologically. Since the protein content of the plasma ishigher than that of interstitial fluid, oncotic pressure ofplasma is higher (average 25 mmHg) than that of interstitialfluid (average 8 mmHg).\\nEffective oncotic pressure  is the difference between the\\nhigher oncotic pressure of plasma and the lower oncoticpressure of interstitial fluid and is the force that tends to draw\\nfluid into the vessels .\\n2. HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE.  This is the capillary blood\\npressure.There is considerable pressure gradient  at the two ends of\\ncapillary loop—being higher at the arteriolar end (average32 mmHg) than at the venular end (average 12 mmHg).\\nTissue tension  is the hydrostatic pressure of interstitial\\nfluid and is lower than the hydrostatic pressure in thecapillary at either end (average 4 mmHg).\\nEffective hydrostatic pressure  is the difference between\\nthe higher hydrostatic pressure in the capillary and the lowertissue tension; it is the force that drives fluid through the capillary\\nwall into the interstitial space .\\nNormal Fluid Exchanges\\nNormally, the fluid exchanges between the body\\ncompartments take place as under:\\nAt the arteriolar end of the capillary , the balance between\\nthe hydrostatic pressure (32 mmHg) and plasma oncoticpressure (25 mmHg) is the hydrostatic pressure of 7 mmHg\\nwhich is the outward-driving force so that a small quantityof fluid and solutes leave the vessel to enter the interstitial\\nspace.\\nFigure 5.3 Diagrammatic representation of pathogenesis of oedema (OP = oncotic pressure; HP = hydrostatic pressure).

Oedema2. Dehydration\\n3. Overhydration\\nThese are discussed below.\\nOEDEMA\\nDEFINITION AND TYPES\\nThe Greek word oidema  means swelling. Oedema may be\\ndefined as abnormal and excessive accumulation of “free fluid” in\\nthe interstitial tissue spaces and serous cavities . The presence of\\nabnormal collection of fluid within the cell is sometimes\\ncalled intracellular oedema but should more appropriately\\nbe called hydropic degeneration (page 34).\\nFree fluid in body cavities: Dpending upon the body cavity\\nin which the fluid accumulates, it is correspondingly knownas ascites (if in the peritoneal cavity), hydrothorax or pleural\\neffusion (if in the pleural cavity), and hydropericardium or\\npericardial effusion (if in the pericardial cavity).\\nFree fluid in interstitial space:  The oedema fluid lies free in\\nthe interstitial space between the cells and can be displaced\\nfrom one place to another. In the case of oedema in the\\nsubcutaneous tissues, momentary pressure of fingerproduces a depression known as pitting oedema . The other\\nvariety is non-pitting  or solid oedema  in which no pitting is\\nproduced on pressure e.g. in myxoedema, elephantiasis.\\nThe oedema may be of 2 main types:\\n1.Localised  when limited to an organ or limb e.g. lymphatic\\noedema, inflammatory oedema, allergic oedema.\\n2.Generalised (anasarca or dropsy)  when it is systemic in\\ndistribution, particularly noticeable in the subcutaneous\\ntissues e.g. renal oedema, cardiac oedema, nutritional\\noedema.\\nBesides, there are a few special forms  of oedema (e.g.\\npulmonary oedema, cerebal oedema) discussed later.\\nDepending upon fluid composition, oedema fluid may\\nbe:\\ntransudate  which is more often the case, such as in oedema\\nof cardiac and renal disease; or\\nexudate  such as in inflammatory oedema.\\nThe differences between transudate and exudate are\\ntabulated in Table 5.1 .\\nPATHOGENESIS OF OEDEMA\\nOedema is caused by mechanisms that interfere with normal\\nfluid balance of plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph flow.The following mechanisms may be operating singly or incombination to produce oedema:1. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure\\n2.Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure\\n3.\\nLymphatic obstruction\\n4. Tissue factors (increased oncotic pressure of interstitialfluid, and decreased tissue tension)5. Increased capillary permeability6. Sodium and water retention.\\nThese mechanisms are discussed below and illustrated\\nin Fig. 5.3:\\n1.DECREASED PLASMA ONCOTIC PRESSURE.

Examples Oedema in congestive cardiac failure Purulent exudate such as pus97CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamicspressure in a way that it can no longer counteract the effect\\nof hydrostatic pressure of blood. This results in increasedoutward movement of fluid from the capillary wall and\\ndecreased inward movement of fluid from the interstitial\\nspace causing oedema (Fig. 5.3,B). Hypoproteinaemia\\nusually produces generalised oedema (anasarca). Out of thevarious plasma proteins, albumin has four times higherplasma oncotic pressure than globulin; thus it is mainly hypo-albuminaemia (albumin below 2.5 g/dl) that results in\\noedema more often.\\nThe examples  of oedema by this mechanism are seen in\\nthe following conditions:\\ni)Oedema of renal disease  e.g. in nephrotic syndrome, acute\\nglomerulonephritis.ii)Ascites  of liver disease e.g. in cirrhosis of the liver.\\niii)Oedema due to other causes  of hypoproteinaemia e.g. in\\nprotein-losing enteropathy.\\n2. INCREASED CAPILLARY HYDROSTATIC PRES-\\nSURE.  The hydrostatic pressure of the capillary is the force\\nthat normally tends to drive fluid through the capillarywall into the interstitial space by counteracting the force\\nof plasma oncotic pressure. A rise in the hydrostatic\\npressure at the venular end of the capillary which isnormally low (average 12 mmHg) to a level more than theplasma oncotic pressure results in minimal or noreabsorption of fluid at the venular end, consequentlyleading to oedema (Fig. 5.3,C).\\nThe examples  of oedema by this mechanism are seen in\\nthe following disorders:\\ni)Oedema of cardiac disease  e.g. in congestive cardiac failure,\\nconstrictive pericarditis.ii)Ascites of liver disease  e.g. in cirrhosis of the liver.\\niii)Passive congestion  e.g. in mechanical obstruction due to\\nthrombosis of veins of the lower legs, varicosities, pressureby pregnant uterus, tumours etc.iv)Postural oedema  e.g. transient oedema of feet and ankles\\ndue to increased venous pressure seen in individuals whoremain standing erect for longtime such as traffic constables.\\n3. LYMPHATIC OBSTRUCTION.  Normally, the inter-\\nstitial fluid in the tissue spaces escapes by way of lympha-\\ntics. Obstruction to outflow of these channels causes localisedoedema, known as lymphoedema (Fig. 5.3,D) .\\nThe examples  of lymphoedema include the following:\\ni)Removal of axillary lymph nodes  in radical mastectomy for\\ncarcinoma of the breast produces lymphoedema of the\\naffected arm.\\nii)Pressure from outside  on the main abdominal or thoracic\\nduct such as due to tumours, effusions in serous cavities etc\\nmay produce lymphoedema. At times, the main lymphaticchannel may rupture and discharge chyle into the pleuralcavity (chylothorax) or into peritoneal cavity (chylousascites).\\niii)Inflammation of the lymphatics  as seen in filariasis (infection\\nwith Wuchereria bancrofti ) results in chronic lymphoedema\\nof scrotum and legs known as elephantiasis.\\niv)Occlusion of lymphatic channels  by malignant cells may\\nresult in lymphoedema.v)Milroy’s disease or hereditary lymphoedema  is due to\\nabnormal development of lymphatic channels. It is seen in\\nfamilies and the oedema is mainly confined to one or boththe lower limbs (Chapter 15).\\n4. TISSUE FACTORS.  The two forces acting in the inter-\\nstitial space—oncotic pressure of the interstitial space and\\ntissue tension, are normally quite small and insignificant tocounteract the effects of plasma oncotic pressure andcapillary hydrostatic pressure respectively. However, insome situations, the tissue factors in combination with othermechanisms play a role in causation of oedema (Fig. 5.3,E) .\\nThese are as under:i)Elevation of oncotic pressure of interstitial fluid as occurs due\\nto increased vascular permeability and inadequate removalof proteins by lymphatics.ii)Lowered tissue tension as seen in loose subcutaneous tissues\\nof eyelids and external genitalia.\\n5.\\nINCREASED CAPILLARY PERMEABILITY.  An intact\\ncapillary endothelium is a semipermeable membrane which\\npermits the free flow of water and crystalloids but allowsminimal passage of plasma proteins normally. However,when the capillary endothelium is injured by various‘capillary poisons’ such as toxins and their products,histamine, anoxia, venoms, certain drugs and chemicals, thecapillary permeability to plasma proteins is enhanced dueto development of gaps between the endothelial cells, leadingto leakage of plasma proteins into interstitial fluid. This, inturn, causes reduced plasma oncotic pressure and elevatedoncotic pressure of interstitial fluid which consequentlyproduces oedema (Fig. 5.3,F) .\\nThe examples  of oedema due to increased vascular\\npermeability are seen in the following conditions:\\ni)Generalised oedema  occurring in systemic infections,\\npoisonings, certain drugs and chemicals, anaphylactic\\nreactions and anoxia.\\nii)Localised oedema . A few examples are as under:\\nInflammatory oedema  as seen in infections, allergic\\nreactions, insect-bite, irritant drugs and chemicals. It is\\ngenerally exudate in nature.\\nAngioneurotic oedema  is an acute attack of localised\\noedema occurring on the skin of face and trunk and mayinvolve lips, larynx, pharynx and lungs. It is possiblyneurogenic or allergic in origin.\\n6. SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION.  Before descri-\\nbing the mechanism of oedema by sodium and waterretention in extravascular compartment, it is essential torecollect the normal regulatory mechanism of sodium andwater balance.\\nNatrium (Na) is the Latin term for sodium. Normally,\\nabout 80% of sodium is reabsorbed by the proximalconvoluted tubule under the influence of either intrinsic renalmechanism or extra-renal mechanism while retention ofwater is affected by release of antidiuretic hormone (Fig. 5.4):\\nIntrinsic renal mechanism  is activated in response to\\nsudden reduction in the effective arterial blood volume(hypovolaemia) e.g. in severe haemorrhage. Hypovolaemiastimulates the arterial baroreceptors present in the carotid98SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nsinus and aortic arch which, in turn, send the sympathetic\\noutflow via the vasomotor centre in the brain. As a result of\\nthis, renal ischaemia occurs which causes reduction in the\\nglomerular filtration rate, decreased excretion of sodium in\\nthe urine and consequent retention of sodium.\\nExtra-renal mechanism  involves the secretion of\\naldosterone, a sodium retaining hormone, by the renin-\\nangiotensin-aldosterone system . Renin is an enzyme secreted\\nby the granular cells in the juxta-glomerular apparatus. Its\\nrelease is stimulated in response to low concentration of\\nsodium in the tubules. Its main action is stimulation of the\\nangiotensinogen which is α2-globulin or renin substrate\\npresent in the plasma. On stimulation, angiotensin I, adecapeptide, is formed in the plasma which is subsequently\\nconverted into angiotensin II, an octapeptide, in the lungs\\nand kidneys by angiotension converting enzyme (ACE).\\nAngiotensin II stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldo-\\nsterone hormone. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption\\nin the renal tubules and sometimes causes a rise in the blood\\npressure.ADH mechanism . Retention of sodium leads to retention\\nof water secondarily under the influence of anti-diuretic\\nhormone (ADH) or vasopressin. This hormone is secreted\\nby the cells of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in\\nthe hypothalamus and is stored in the neurohypophysis\\n(posterior pituitary). The release of hormone is stimulated\\nby increased concentration of sodium in the plasma and\\nhypovolaemia. Large amounts of ADH produce highly\\nconcentrated urine.\\nThe possible factors responsible for causation of oedema\\nby excessive retention of sodium and water in the\\nextravascular compartment via stimulation of intrinsic renal\\nand extra-renal mechanisms as well as via release of ADH\\nare as under:\\ni) Reduced glomerular filtration rate in response to\\nhypovolaemia.\\nii) Enhanced tubular reabsorption of sodium and\\nconsequently its decreased renal excretion.\\niii) Increased filtration factor i.e. increased filtration of plasma\\nfrom the glomerulus.Figure 5.4 Mechanisms involved in oedema by sodium and water retention.\\n99CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamicsiv) Decreased capillary hydrostatic pressure associated with\\nincreased renal vascular resistance.\\nThe examples  of oedema by these mechanims are as\\nunder:i)Oedema of cardiac disease  e.g. in congestive cardiac failure.\\nii)Ascites  of liver disease e.g. in cirrhosis of liver.\\niii)Oedema of renal disease  e.g. in nephrotic syndrome, acute\\nglomerulonephritis.\\nPATHOGENESIS AND MORPHOLOGY OF\\nIMPORTANT TYPES OF OEDEMA\\nAs observed from the pathogenesis of oedema just described,\\nmore than one mechanism may be involved in many\\nexamples of localised and generalised oedema. Some of the\\nimportant examples are described below.\\nRenal Oedema\\nGeneralised oedema occurs in certain diseases of renal origin\\nsuch as in nephrotic syndrome, some types of\\nglomerulonephritis, and in renal failure due to acute tubular\\ninjury.\\n1.\\nOedema in nephrotic syndrome.  Since there is persistent\\nand heavy proteinuria (albuminuria) in nephrotic syndrome,\\nthere is hypoalbuminaemia causing decreased plasma\\noncotic pressure resulting in severe generalised oedema\\n(nephrotic oedema) . The hypoalbuminaemia causes fall in the\\nplasma volume activating renin-angiotensin-aldosteronemechanism which results in retention of sodium and water,\\nthus setting in a vicious cycle which persists till the\\nalbuminuria continues. Similar type of mechanism operates\\nin the pathogenesis of oedema in protein-losing enteropathy,\\nfurther confirming the role of protein loss in the causation of\\noedema.\\nThe nephrotic oedema  is classically more severe and\\nmarked and is present in the subcutaneous tissues as well as\\nin the visceral organs. The affected organ is enlarged and\\nheavy with tense capsule.\\nMicroscopically,  the oedema fluid separates the\\nconnective tissue fibres of subcutaneous tissues.\\nDepending upon the protein content, the oedema fluidmay appear homogeneous, pale, eosinophilic, or may bedeeply eosinophilic and granular.\\n2. Oedema in nephritic syndrome.  Oedema occurs in\\nconditions with diffuse glomerular disease such as in acute\\ndiffuse glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressiveglomerulonephritis (nephritic oedema) . In contrast to nephrotic\\noedema, nephritic oedema is not due to hypoproteinaemiabut is largely due to excessive reabsorption of sodium andwater in the renal tubules via renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\\nmechanism. The protein content of oedema fluid in\\nglomerulonephritis is quite low (less than 0.5 g/dl).\\nThe nephritic oedema  is usually mild as compared to\\nnephrotic oedema and begins in the loose tissues such as on\\nthe face around eyes, ankles and genitalia. Oedema in these\\nconditions is usually not affected by gravity (unlike cardiacoedema).\\nThe salient differences between the nephrotic and\\nnephritic oedema are outlined in Table 5.2 .\\n3. Oedema in acute tubular injury.  Acute tubular injury\\nfollowing shock or toxic chemicals results in gross oedemaof the body. The damaged tubules lose their capacity for\\nselective reabsorption and concentration of the glomerular\\nfiltrate resulting in increased reabsorption and oliguria.Besides, there is excessive retention of water and electrolytesand rise in blood urea.\\nCardiac Oedema\\nGeneralised oedema develops in right-sided and congestive\\ncardiac failure. Pathogenesis of cardiac oedema is explainedon the basis of the following hypotheses (Fig. 5.5):\\n1. Reduced cardiac output causes hypovolaemia whichstimulates intrinsic-renal and extra-renal hormonal (renin-angiotensin -aldosterone) mechanisms as well as ADH\\nsecretion resulting in sodium and water retention andconsequent oedema.\\n2.\\nDue to heart failure, there is elevated central venous\\npressure which is transmitted backward to the venous end\\nof the capillaries, raising the capillary hydrostatic pressure\\nand consequent transudation; this is known as back pressure\\nhypothesis .\\n3. Chronic hypoxia may injure the capillary wall causing\\nincreased capillary permeability and result in oedema; thisis called forward pressure hypothesis . However, this theory\\nlacks support since the oedema by this mechanism is exudatewhereas the cardiac oedema is typically transudate.\\nIn left heart failure, the changes are, however, different.\\nThere is venous congestion, particularly in the lungs, so thatpulmonary oedema develops rather than generalised oedema(described below).\\nCardiac oedema is influenced by gravity and is thus\\ncharacteristically dependent oedema  i.e. in an ambulatory\\npatient it is on the lower extremities, while in a bed-ridden\\npatient oedema appears on the sacral and genital areas. Theaccumulation of fluid may also occur in serous cavities.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 5.2: Differences between Nephrotic and Nephritic Oedema.\\nFeature Nephrotic Oedema Nephritic Oedema\\n1.

Distribution Subcutaneous tissues as well as visceral organs Loose tissues mainly (face, eyes, ankles, genitalia)100SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nPulmonary Oedema\\nAcute pulmonary oedema is the most important form of local\\noedema as it causes serious functional impairment but hasspecial features. It differs from oedema elsewhere in that thefluid accumulation is not only in the tissue space but also inthe pulmonary alveoli.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The hydrostatic pressure in the\\npulmonary capillaries is much lower (average 10 mmHg).Normally the plasma oncotic pressure is adequate to prevent\\nthe escape of fluid into the interstitial space and hence lungsare normally free of oedema. Pulmonary oedema can resultfrom either the elevation of pulmonary hydrostatic pressureor the increased capillary permeability (Fig. 5.6).\\n1. Elevation in pulmonary hydrostatic pressure (Haemo-\\ndynamic oedema).  In heart failure, there is increase in the\\npressure in pulmonary veins which is transmitted to\\npulmonary capillaries. This results in imbalance betweenFigure 5.5 Mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac oedema.\\nFigure 5.6 Mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary oedema. A, Normal fluid exchange at the alveolocapillary membrane\\n(capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium). B, Pulmonary oedema via elevated pulmonary hydrostatic pressure. C, Pulmonary oedema via\\nincreased vascular permeability.\\n101CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics\\nrespiratory ill-effects. Commonly, the deleterious effects\\nbegin to appear after an altitude of 2500 metres is reached.These changes include appearance of oedema fluid in thelungs, congestion and widespread minute haemorrhages.These changes can cause death within a few days. The under-lying mechanism appears to be anoxic damage to the\\npulmonary vessels. However, if acclimatisation to high\\naltitude is allowed to take place, the individual developspolycythaemia, raised pulmonary arterial pressure, increasedpulmonary ventilation and a rise in heart rate and increasedcardiac output.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Irrespective of the under-\\nlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of pulmonaryoedema, the fluid accumulates more in the basal regionsof lungs. The thickened interlobular septa along with their\\ndilated lymphatics may be seen in chest X-ray as linear\\nlines perpendicular to the pleura and are known as Kerley’s\\nlines .\\nGrossly , the lungs in pulmonary oedema are heavy, moist\\nand subcrepitant. Cut surface exudes frothy fluid (mixtureof air and fluid).\\nMicroscopically , the alveolar capillaries are congested.\\nInitially, the excess fluid collects in the interstitial lung\\nspaces (interstitial oedema). Later, the fluid fills thealveolar spaces (alveolar oedema). Oedema fluid in theinterstitium as well as the alveolar spaces appears aseosinophilic, granular and pink proteinaceous material,\\noften admixed with some RBCs and macrophages\\n(Fig. 5.7).  This may be seen as brightly eosinophilic pink\\nlines along the alveolar margin called hyaline membrane .\\nLong-standing pulmonary oedema is prone to get\\ninfected by bacteria producing hypostatic pneumonia\\nwhich may be fatal.\\nCerebral Oedema\\nCerebral oedema or swelling of brain is the most threatening\\nexample of oedema. The mechanism of fluid exchange in thepulmonary hydrostatic pressure and the plasma oncotic\\npressure so that excessive fluid moves out of pulmonarycapillaries into the interstitium of the lungs. Simultaneously,the endothelium of the pulmonary capillaries develops\\nfenestrations permitting passage of plasma proteins and fluid\\ninto the interstitium. The interstitial fluid so collected iscleared by the lymphatics present around the bronchioles,small muscular arteries and veins. As the capacity of the\\nlymphatics to drain the fluid is exceeded (about ten-fold\\nincrease in fluid), the excess fluid starts accumulating in theinterstitium (interstitial oedema)  i.e. in the loose tissues around\\nbronchioles, arteries and in the lobular septa. Next follows\\nthe thickening of the alveolar walls because of the interstitial\\noedema. Upto this stage, no significant impairment ofgaseous exchange occurs. However, prolonged elevation ofhydrostatic pressure and due to high pressure of interstitial\\noedema, the alveolar lining cells break and the alveolar air\\nspaces are flooded with fluid (alveolar oedema)  driving the air\\nout of alveolus, thus seriously hampering the lung function.\\nExamples  of pulmonary oedema by this mechanism are\\nseen in left heart failure, mitral stenosis, pulmonary vein\\nobstruction, thyrotoxicosis, cardiac surgery, nephroticsyndrome and obstruction to the lymphatic outflow bytumour or inflammation.\\n2.Increased vascular permeability (Irritant oedema).  The\\nvascular endothelium as well as the alveolar epithelial cells\\n(alveolo-capillary membrane) may be damaged causingincreased vascular permeability so that excessive fluid andplasma proteins leak out, initially into the interstitium andsubsequently into the alveoli.\\nThis mechanism explains pulmonary oedema in examples\\nsuch as in fulminant pulmonary and extrapulmonaryinfections, inhalation of toxic substances, aspiration, shock,\\nradiation injury, hypersensitivity to drugs or antisera,uraemia and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\\n3. Acute high altitude oedema. Individuals climbing to high\\naltitude suddenly without halts and without waiting for\\nacclimatisation to set in, suffer from serious circulatory andFigure 5.7 Pulmonary oedema. The alveolar capillaries are congested. The alveolar spaces as well as interstitium contain eosinophilic,\\ngranular, homogeneous and pink proteinaceous oedema fluid alongwith some RBCs and inflammatory cells.\\n102SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesbrain differs from elsewhere in the body since there are no\\ndraining lymphatics in the brain but instead, the function of\\nfluid-electrolyte exchange is performed by the blood-brainbarrier located at the endothelial cells of the capillaries.\\nCerebral oedema can be of 3 types:\\n1. VASOGENIC OEDEMA.  This is the most common type\\nand corresponds to oedema elsewhere resulting fromincreased filtration pressure or increased capillary perme-ability. Vasogenic oedema is prominent around cerebralcontusions, infarcts, brain abscess and some tumours.\\nGrossly , the white matter is swollen, soft, with flattened\\ngyri and narrowed sulci. Sectioned surface is soft andgelatinous.Microscopically , there is separation of tissue elements by\\nthe oedema fluid and swelling of astrocytes. Theperivascular (Virchow-Robin) space is widened and clearhalos are seen around the small blood vessels.\\n2. CYTOTOXIC OEDEMA.  In this type, the blood-brain\\nbarrier is intact and the fluid accumulation is intracellular.The underlying mechanism is disturbance in the cellularosmoregulation as occurs in some metabolic derangements,acute hypoxia and with some toxic chemicals.\\nMicroscopically , the cells are swollen and vacuolated. In\\nsome situations, both vasogenic as well as cytotoxiccerebral oedema results e.g. in purulent meningitis.\\n3. INTERSTITIAL OEDEMA.  This type of cerebral oedema\\noccurs when the excessive fluid crosses the ependymal liningof the ventricles and accumulates in the periventricular whitematter. This mechanism is responsible for oedema in non-communicating hydrocephalus.\\nHepatic Oedema\\nWhile this subject is discussed in detail in Chapter 21, briefly\\nthe mechanisms involved in causation of oedema of the legs\\nand ascites in cirrhosis of the liver is as under:i) There is hypoproteinaemia due to impaired synthesis ofproteins by the diseased liver.ii) Due to portal hypertension, there is increased venouspressure in the abdomen, and hence raised hydrostatic\\npressure.\\niii) Failure of inactivation of aldosterone in the diseased liverand hence hyperaldosteronism.iv) Secondary stimulation of renin-angiotensin mechanismpromoting sodium and water retention.\\nNutritional Oedema\\nOedema due to nutritional deficiency of proteins (kwashiorkor,\\nprolonged starvation, famine, fasting), vitamins (beri-beri dueto vitamin B\\n1 deficiency) and chronic alcoholism occurs on\\nlegs but sometimes may be more generalised. The maincontributing factors are hypoproteinaemia and sodium-water\\nretention related to metabolic abnormalities.\\nMyxoedema\\nMyxoedema from hypothyroidism (Chapter 27) is a form of\\nnon-pitting oedema occurring on skin of face and other partsof the body as also in the internal organs due to excessivedeposition of glycosaminoglycans in the interstitium.Microscopically, it appears as basophilic mucopoly-saccharides.\\nDEHYDRATION\\nDehydration is a state of pure deprivation of water leading\\nto sodium retention and hence a state of hypernatraemia. Inother words, there is only loss of water but no loss of sodium.Clinically, the patients present with intense thirst, mentalconfusion, fever, and oliguria.\\nETIOLOGY.  Pure water deficiency is less common than salt\\ndepletion but can occur in the following conditions:\\n1.GI excretion:\\ni) Severe vomitings\\nii) Diarrhoeaiii) Cholera\\n2. Renal excretion:\\ni) Acute renal failure in diuretic phaseii) Extensive use of diureticsiii) Endocrine diseases e.g. diabetes insipidus, Addison’sdisease\\n3. Loss of blood and plasma:\\ni)  Severe injuries, severe burnsii)  During childbirth\\n4. Loss through skin:\\ni) Excessive perspirationii) Hyperthermia\\n5. Accumulation in third space:\\ni) Sudden development of ascitesii) Acute intestinal obstruction with accumulation of fluid inthe bowel.\\nMORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES.  Although there are no\\nparticular pathological changes in organs, except inadvanced cases when the organs are dark and shrunken.However, there are haematological and biochemicalchanges. There is haemoconcentration as seen by increasedPCV and raised haemoglobin. In late stage, there is rise inblood urea and serum sodium. Renal shutdown and a stateof shock may develop.\\nOVERHYDRA TION\\nOverhydration is increased extracellular fluid volume dueto pure water excess or water intoxication.  Clinically, the\\npatients would present with disordered cerebral function e.g.nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion and in severe casesconvulsions, coma, and even death.\\nETIOLOGY . Overhydration is generally an induced\\ncondition and is encountered in the following situations:\\n1.Excessive unmonitored intravascular infusion:\\ni) Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride)\\nii) Ringer lactate\\n2. Renal retention of sodium and water:\\ni)  Congestive heart failureii)  Acute glomerulonephritis103CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamicsiii)  Cirrhosis\\niv)  Cushing’s syndromev)  Chronic renal failure\\nMORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES.  Sudden weight gain is\\na significant parameter of excess of fluid accumulation.Haematological and biochemical changes include reducedplasma electrolytes, lowered plasma proteins and reducedPCV.\\nDISTURBANCES OF ELECTROLYTES\\nIt may be recalled here once again that normally theconcentration of electrolytes within the cell and in the plasmais different. Intracelluar compartment has higherconcentration of potassium, calcium, magnesium andphosphate ions than the blood, while extracellular fluid(including serum) has higher concentration of sodium,chloride, and bicarbonate ions. In health, for electrolyte\\nhomeostasis , the concentration of electrolytes in both these\\ncompartments should be within normal limits. Normal serumlevels of electrolytes are maintained in the body by a carefulbalance of 4 processes: their intake, absorption, distributionand excretion. Disturbance in any of these processes in diversepathophysiologic states may cause electrolyte imbalance .\\nAmong the important components in electrolyte\\nimbalance, abnormalities in serum levels of sodium (hypo-and hypernatraemia), potassium (hypo- and hyperkalaemia),calcium (hypo- and hypercalcaemia) and magnesium (hypo-and hypermagnesaemia) are clinically more important. It isbeyond the scope of this book to delve into this subject indetail. However, a few general principles on electrolyteimbalances are as under:\\n1. Electrolyte imbalance in a given case may result from one\\nor more conditions.2.Resultant abnormal serum level of more than one\\nelectrolyte may be linked to each other. For example,abnormality in serum levels of sodium and potassium;calcium and phosphate.3\\n.  Generally, the reflection of biochemical serum electrolyte\\nlevels is in the form of metabolic syndrome and clinicalfeatures rather than morphological findings in organs.4. Clinical manifestations of a particular electrolyteimbalance are related to its pathophysiologic role in that organor tissue.\\nA list of important clinical conditions producing\\nabnormalities in sodium and potassium are given inTable 5.3 while calcium and phosphate imbalances are\\ndiscussed in Chapter 28.\\nACID-BASE IMBALANCE\\n(ABNORMALITIES IN pH OF BLOOD)\\nDuring metabolism of cells, carbon dioxide and metabolicacids are produced. CO\\n2 combines with water to form\\ncarbonic acid. The role of bicarbonate buffering system inthe extracelluar compartment has already been stated above.In order to have acid-base homeostasis to maintain bloodpH of 7.4, both carbonic acid and metabolic acids must beexcreted from the body via lungs (for CO\\n2) and kidneys (for\\nmetabolic acids). Thus, the pH of blood depends upon 2principal factors:\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 5.3:  Major Electrolyte Imbalances.\\nHYPONATRAEMIA\\nA. Gain of relatively more water than loss of sodium\\ni\\n.

This occurs in the following situations:\\nProduction of large amounts of lactic acid (lactic acido-\\nsis) e.g. in vigorous exercise, shock.\\nUncontrolled diabetes mellitus (diabetic ketoacidosis).\\nStarvation.\\nChronic renal failure.\\nTherapeutic administration of ammonium chloride or\\nacetazolamide (diamox).\\nHigh blood levels of H+ ions in metabolic acidosis\\nstimulate the respiratory centre so that the breathing is deep\\nand rapid (air hunger or Kussmaul’s respiration) . There is fall\\nin the plasma bicarbonate levels.\\nMetabolic Alkalosis\\nA rise in the blood pH due to rise in the bicarbonate levels of\\nplasma and loss of H+ ions is called metabolic alkalosis. This\\nis seen in the following conditions:\\nSevere and prolonged vomitings.\\nAdministration of alkaline salts like sodium bicarbonate.\\nHypokalaemia such as in Cushing’s syndrome, increased\\nsecretion of aldosterone.\\nClinically, metabolic alkalosis is characterised by\\ndepression of respiration, depressed renal function withuraemia and increased bicarbonate excretion in the urine.\\nThe blood level of bicarbonate is elevated.\\nRespiratory Acidosis\\nA fall in the blood pH occurring due to raised Pco\\n2 conse-\\nquent to underventilation of lungs (CO2 retention) causes\\nrespiratory acidosis. This can occur in the following\\ncircumstances:\\nAir obstruction as occurs in chronic bronchitis, emphy-\\nsema, asthma.\\nRestricted thoracic movement e.g. in pleural effusion,\\nascites, pregnancy, kyphoscoliosis.\\nImpaired neuromuscular function e.g. in poliomyelitis,\\npolyneuritis.Clinically, there is peripheral vasodilatation and raised\\nintracranial pressure. If there is severe CO2 retention, patients\\nmay develop confusion, drowsiness and coma. The arterialPco\\n2 level is raised.\\nRespiratory Alkalosis\\nA rise in the blood pH occurring due to lowered Pco2\\nconsequent to hyperventilation of the lungs (excess removal\\nof CO2) is called respiratory alkalosis. This is encountered in\\nthe following conditions:\\nHysterical overbreathing\\nWorking at high temperature\\nAt high altitude\\nMeningitis, encephalitis\\nSalicylate intoxication\\nClinically, the patients with respiratory alkalosis are\\ncharacterised by peripheral vasoconstriction and consequentpallor, lightheadedness and tetany. The arterial Pco\\n2 is\\nlowered.\\nHAEMODYNAMIC DERANGEMENTS\\nThe principles of blood flow are called haemodynamics.Normal circulatory function requires uninterrupted flow ofblood from the left ventricle to the farthest capillaries in thebody; return of blood from systemic capillary network intothe right ventricle; and from the right ventricle to the farthestpulmonary capillaries and back to the left atrium (Fig. 5.8) .\\nThere are three essential requirements to maintain normal\\nblood flow and perfusion of tissues: normal anatomic\\nfeatures, normal physiologic controls for blood flow, andnormal biochemical composition of the blood.\\nDerangements of blood flow or haemodynamic distur-\\nbances are considered under 2 broad headings:\\nI.Disturbances in the volume of the circulating blood . These\\ninclude: hyperaemia and congestion, haemorrhage and\\nshock.\\nII.Circulatory disturbances of obstructive nature . These are:\\nthrombosis, embolism, ischaemia and infarction.\\nFigure 5.8 Normal haemodynamic flow of blood in the body.\\n105CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and HaemodynamicsDISTURBANCES IN THE VOLUME OF\\nCIRCULATING BLOOD\\nHYPERAEMIA AND CONGESTION\\nHyperaemia and congestion are the terms used for localised\\nincrease in the volume of blood within dilated vessels of anorgan or tissue; the increased volume from arterial andarteriolar dilatation being referred to as hyperaemia  or active\\nhyperaemia , whereas the impaired venous drainage is called\\nvenous congestion or passive hyperaemia . If the condition\\ndevelops rapidly it is called acute , while more prolonged and\\ngradual response is known as chronic .\\nActive Hyperaemia\\nThe dilatation of arteries, arterioles and capillaries is effected\\neither through sympathetic neurogenic mechanism or via the\\nrelease of vasoactive substances. The affected tissue or organ\\nis pink or red in appearance (erythema).\\nThe examples  of active hyperaemia are seen in the\\nfollowing conditions:\\nInflammation e.g. congested vessels in the walls of alveoli\\nin pneumonia\\nBlushing i.e. flushing of the skin of face in response to\\nemotions\\nMenopausal flush\\nMuscular exercise\\nHigh grade fever\\nGoitre\\nArteriovenous malformations\\nClinically, hyperaemia is characterised by redness and\\nraised temperature in the affected part.Passive Hyperaemia (Venous Congestion)\\nThe dilatation of veins and capillaries due to impaired venous\\ndrainage results in passive hyperaemia or venous congestion,commonly referred to as congestion. Congestion may be acute\\nor chronic, the latter being more common and called chronic\\nvenous congestion  (CVC). The affected tissue or organ is bluish\\nin colour due to accumulation of venous blood (cyanosis).Obstruction to the venous outflow may be local or systemic.Accordingly, venous congestion is of 2 types:\\nLocal venous congestion  results from obstruction to the\\nvenous outflow from an organ or part of the body e.g. portalvenous obstruction in cirrhosis of the liver, outside pressureon the vessel wall as occurs in tight bandage, plasters,tumours, pregnancy, hernia etc, or intraluminal occlusionby thrombosis.\\nSystemic (General) venous congestion  is engorgement of\\nsystemic veins e.g. in left-sided and right-sided heart failureand diseases of the lungs which interfere with pulmonaryblood flow like pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema etc. Usuallythe fluid accumulates upstream to the specific chamber ofthe heart which is initially affected (Chapter 16). Forexample, in left-sided heart failure  (such as due to mechanical\\noverload in aortic stenosis, or due to weakened leftventricular wall as in myocardial infarction) pulmonarycongestion results, whereas in right-sided heart failure  (such\\nas due to pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary hypertension)systemic venous congestion results. Fig. 5.9  illustrates the\\nmechanisms involved in passive or venous congestion of\\ndifferent organs.\\nFigure 5.9 Schematic representation of mechanisms involved in chronic venous congestion (CVC) of different organs.\\n106SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nMORPHOLOGY OF CVC OF ORGANS\\nCVC Lung\\nChronic venous congestion of the lung occurs in left heart\\nfailure (Chapter 16), especially in rheumatic mitral stenosisso that there is consequent rise in pulmonary venouspressure.\\nGrossly,  the lungs are heavy and firm in consistency. The\\nsectioned surface is dark The sectioned surface is rusty\\nbrown in colour referred to as brown induration  of the\\nlungs.\\nHistologically , the alveolar septa are widened due to the\\npresence of interstitial oedema as well as due to dilatedand congested capillaries. The septa are mildly thickeneddue to slight increase in fibrous connective tissue. Ruptureof dilated and congested capillaries may result in minuteintra-alveolar haemorrhages. The breakdown oferythrocytes liberates haemosiderin pigment which istaken up by alveolar macrophages, so called heart failure\\ncells,  seen in the alveolar lumina. The brown induration\\nobserved on the cut surface of the lungs is due to thepigmentation and fibrosis (Fig. 5.10) .\\nCVC Liver\\nChronic venous congestion of the liver occurs in right heart\\nfailure and sometimes due to occlusion of inferior vena cavaand hepatic vein.\\nGrossly , the liver is enlarged and tender and the capsule\\nis tense. Cut surface shows characteristic nutmeg*\\nappearance due to red and yellow mottled appearance,corresponding to congested centre of lobules and fattyperipheral zone respectively (Fig. 5.11) .Figure 5.10 CVC lung. The alveolar septa are widened and thickened due to congestion, oedema and mild fibrosis. The alveolar lumina\\ncontain heart failure cells (alveolar macrophages containing haemosiderin pigment).\\nMicroscopically , the changes of congestion are more\\nmarked in the centrilobular zone due to severe hypoxiathan in the peripheral zone. The central veins as well asthe adjacent sinusoids are distended and filled with blood.The centrilobular hepatocytes undergo degenerativechanges, and eventually centrilobular haemorrhagic  necrosis\\nmay be seen. Long-standing cases may show finecentrilobular fibrosis and regeneration of hepatocytes,resulting in cardiac cirrhosis (Chapter 21). The peripheralzone of the lobule is less severely affected by chronichypoxia and shows some fatty change  in the hepatocytes\\n(Fig. 5.12) .\\nCVC Spleen\\nChronic venous congestion of the spleen occurs in right heart\\nfailure and in portal hypertension from cirrhosis of liver.\\nGrossly , the spleen in early stage is slightly to moderately\\nenlarged (up to 250 g as compared to normal 150 g), while\\nin long-standing cases there is progressive enlargement\\nand may weigh up to 500 to 1000 g. The organ is deeply\\ncongested, tense and cyanotic. Sectioned surface is graytan (Fig. 5.13) .\\nMicroscopically , the features are as under (Fig. 5.14):\\ni) Red pulp  is enlarged due to congestion and marked\\nsinusoidal dilatation and here are areas of recent and oldhaemorrhages. Sinusoids may get converted into\\ncapillaries (capillarisation of sinusoids).\\nii) There is hyperplasia  of reticuloendothelial cells in the\\nred pulp of the spleen (splenic macrophages).iii) There is fibrous thickening  of the capsule and of the\\ntrabeculae.iv) Some of haemorrhages overlying fibrous tissue get\\ndeposits of haemosiderin pigment and calcium salts; these\\n*Nutmeg (vernacular name jaiphal ) is the seed of a spice tree that grows\\nin India, used in cooking as spice for giving flavours.\\n107CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics\\nHAEMORRHAGE\\nHaemorrhage is the escape of blood from a blood vessel. The\\nbleeding may occur externally, or internally  into the serous\\ncavities (e.g. haemothorax, haemoperitoneum, haemoperi-cardium), or into a hollow viscus. Extravasation of blood intothe tissues with resultant swelling is known as haematoma .\\nLarge extravasations of blood into the skin and mucousmembranes are called ecchymoses . Purpuras  are small areas\\nof haemorrhages (upto 1 cm) into the skin and mucous\\nmembrane, whereas petechiae  are minute pinhead-sized\\nhaemorrhages. Microscopic escape of erythrocytes into loose\\ntissues may occur following marked congestion and is knownas diapedesis .\\nETIOLOGY.  The blood loss may be large and sudden (acute),\\nor small repeated bleeds may occur over a period of time\\n(chronic).  The various causes of haemorrhage are as under:Figure 5.11 Nutmeg liver. The cut surface shows mottled\\nappearance—alternate pattern of dark congestion and pale fatty change.\\nFigure 5.12 CVC liver. The centrilobular zone shows marked degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes accompanied by haemorrhage while\\nthe peripheral zone shows mild fatty change of liver cells.organised structures are termed as Gamna-Gandy bodies\\nor siderofibrotic nodules.\\nv) Firmness of the spleen in advanced stage is seen more\\ncommonly in hepatic cirrhosis ( congestive splenomegaly)\\nand is the commonest cause of hypersplenism (Chapter\\n14).\\nCVC Kidney\\nGrossly , the kidneys are slightly enlarged and the medulla\\nis congested.\\nMicroscopically , the changes are rather mild. The tubules\\nmay show degenerative changes like cloudy swelling andfatty change. The glomeruli may show mesangialproliferation.\\n108SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\n1.Trauma  to the vessel wall e.g. penetrating wound in the\\nheart or great vessels, during labour etc.\\n2.Spontaneous haemorrhage  e.g. rupture of an aneurysm,\\nsepticaemia, bleeding diathesis (such as purpura), acuteleukaemias, pernicious anaemia, scurvy.3.Inflammatory lesions of the vessel wall  e.g. bleeding from\\nchronic peptic ulcer, typhoid ulcers, blood vessels traversing\\na tuberculous cavity in the lung, syphilitic involvement of\\nthe aorta, polyarteritis nodosa.4.Neoplastic invasion  e.g. haemorrhage following vascular\\ninvasion in carcinoma of the tongue.\\n5.Vascular diseases  e.g. atherosclerosis.\\n6.Elevated pressure within the vessels  e.g. cerebral and retinal\\nhaemorrhage in systemic hypertension, severe haemorrhagefrom varicose veins due to high pressure in the veins of legs\\nor oesophagus.\\nEFFECTS.  The effects of blood loss depend upon 3 main\\nfactors:\\nthe amount of blood loss;\\nthe speed of blood loss; and\\nthe site of haemorrhage.\\nThe loss up to 20% of blood volume suddenly or slowly\\ngenerally has little clinical effects because of compensatory\\nmechanisms. A sudden loss of 33% of blood volume may\\ncause death, while loss of up to 50% of blood volume over aperiod of 24 hours may not be necessarily fatal. However,chronic blood loss generally produces iron deficiency\\nanaemia, whereas acute haemorrhage may lead to serious\\nimmediate consequences such as hypovolaemic shock.\\nSHOCK\\nDefinition\\nShock is a life-threatening clinical syndrome of cardio-\\nvascular collapse characterised by:\\nan acute reduction of effective circulating blood volume\\n(hypotension); and\\nan inadequate perfusion of cells and tissues\\n(hypoperfusion).\\nIf uncompensated, these mechanisms may lead to\\nimpaired cellular metabolism and death.\\nThus, by definition “ true (or secondary) shock”  is a\\ncirculatory imbalance between oxygen supply and oxygenrequirements at the cellular level, and is also called as\\ncirculatory shock.\\nThe term “ initial (or primary) shock”  is used for transient\\nand usually a benign vasovagal attack resulting from sudden\\nreduction of venous return to the heart caused by neurogenic\\nvasodilatation and consequent peripheral pooling of blood\\ne.g. immediately following trauma, severe pain or emotional\\noverreaction such as due to fear, sorrow or surprise.Clinically, patients of primary shock suffer from the attack\\nlasting for a few seconds or minutes and develop brief\\nunconsciousness, weakness, sinking sensation, pale and\\nFigure 5.14 CVC spleen. The sinuses are dilated and congested. There is increased fibrosis in the red pulp, capsule and the trabeculae.\\nGamna-Gandy body is also seen.\\nFigure 5.13 CVC spleen (Congestive splenomegaly). Sectioned\\nsurface shows that the spleen is heavy and enlarged in size. The colour\\nof sectioned surface is grey-tan.\\n109CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamicsclammy limbs, weak and rapid pulse, and low blood\\npressure. Another type of shock which is not due to\\ncirculatory derangement is anaphylactic shock  from type 1\\nimmunologic reaction (page 73).\\nIn routine clinical practice, however, true shock is the\\nform which occurs due to haemodynamic derangements withhypoperfusion of the cells; this is the type which is commonlyreferred to as ‘shock’ if not specified.\\nClassification and Etiology\\nAlthough in a given clinical case, two or more factors may\\nbe involved in causation of true shock, a simple etiologic\\nclassification of shock syndrome divides it into following 3major types and a few other variants (Table 5.4):\\n1. Hypovolaemic shock.  This form of shock results from\\ninadequate circulatory blood volume by various etiologicfactors that may be either  from the loss of red cell mass and\\nplasma from haemorrhage, or from the loss of plasma volume\\nalone.\\n2. Cardiogenic shock.  Acute circulatory failure with sudden\\nfall in cardiac output from acute diseases of the heart withoutactual reduction of blood volume (normovolaemia) results\\nin cardiogenic shock.\\n3. Septic (Toxaemic) shock.  Severe bacterial infections or\\nsepticaemia induce septic shock. It may be the result of Gram-\\nnegative septicaemia (endotoxic shock) which is more\\ncommon, or Gram-positive septicaemia (exotoxic shock).\\n4. Other types. These include following types:\\ni) Traumatic shock.  Shock resulting from trauma is initially\\ndue to hypovolaemia, but even after haemorrhage has been\\ncontrolled, these patients continue to suffer loss of plasma\\nvolume into the interstitium of injured tissue and hence is\\nconsidered separately in some descriptions.\\nii) Neurogenic shock.  Neurogenic shock results from causes of\\ninterruption of sympathetic vasomotor supply.iii) Hypoadrenal shock.  Hypoadrenal shock occurs from\\nunknown adrenal insufficiency in which the patient fails to\\nrespond normally to the stress of trauma, surgery or illness.\\nPathogenesis\\nIn general, all forms of shock involve following 3\\nderangements:\\nReduced effective circulating blood volume.\\nReduced supply of oxygen to the cells and tissues with\\nresultant anoxia.\\nInflammatory mediators and toxins released from shock-\\ninduced cellular injury.\\nThese derangements initially set in compensatory\\nmechanisms (discussed below) but eventually a vicious cycleof cell injury and severe cellular dysfunction lead tobreakdown of organ function (Fig. 5.15).\\n1.  Reduced effective circulating blood volume.  It may result\\nby either of the following mechanisms:i) by actual loss of blood volume as occurs in hypovolae-mic shock; or\\nii\\n) by decreased cardiac output without actual loss of blood\\n(normovolaemia) as occurs in cardiogenic shock and septic\\nshock.\\n2. Impaired tissue oxygenation.  Following reduction in the\\neffective circulating blood volume from either of the above\\ntwo mechanisms and from any of the etiologic agents, thereis decreased venous return to the heart resulting in decreased\\ncardiac output. This consequently causes reduced supply of\\noxygen to the organs and tissues and hence tissue anoxia,which sets in cellular injury.\\n3. Release of inflammatory mediators.  In response to\\ncellular injury, innate immunity of the body gets activated\\nas a body defense mechanism and release inflammatorymediators but eventually these agents themselves becomethe cause of cell injury. Endotoxins in bacterial wall in septicshock stimulate massive release of pro-inflammatorymediators (cytokines) but a similar process of release ofthese agents takes place in late stages of shock from othercauses. Several pro-inflammatory inflammatory media-tors are released from monocytes-macrophages, otherleucocytes and other body cells, the most important beingthe tumour necrosis factor- (TN F)\\n-α and interleukin-1\\n(IL-1) cytokines (Fig. 5.16).\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 5.4: Classification and Etiology of Shock.\\n1.

Hypo-\\nvolaemic shock occurs from inadequate circulating blood\\nvolume due to various causes. The major effects ofhypovolaemic shock are due to decreased cardiac output and\\nlow intracardiac pressure. The severity of clinical features\\ndepends upon degree of blood volume lost, haemorrhagicshock is divided into 4 types:\\n< 1000 ml: Compensated\\n1000-1500 ml: Mild\\n1500-2000 ml: Moderate\\n>2000 ml: Severe\\nAccordingly, clinical features are increased heart rate\\n(tachycardia), low blood pressure (hypotension), low urinaryoutput (oliguria to anuria) and alteration in mental state(agitated to confused to lethargic).\\nPATHOGENESIS OF CARDIOGENIC SHOCK.  Cardio-\\ngenic shock results from a severe left ventricular dysfunction\\nfrom various causes. The resultant decreased cardiac outputhas its effects in the form of decreased tissue perfusion and\\nmovement of fluid from pulmonary vascular bed into\\npulmonary interstitial space initially ( interstitial pulmonary\\noedema ) and later into alveolar spaces ( alveolar pulmonary\\noedema ).PATHOGENESIS OF SEPTIC SHOCK.  Septic shock results\\nmost often from Gram-negative bacteria entering the body\\nfrom genitourinary tract, alimentary tract, respiratory tractor skin, and less often from Gram-positive bacteria. In septicshock, there is immune system activation and severe systemicinflammatory response to infection as follows:\\ni) \\nActivation of macrophage-monocytes.  Lysis of Gram-\\nnegative bacteria releases endotoxin, a lipopolysaccharide,\\ninto circulation where it binds to lipopolysaccharide-binding\\nprotein (LBP). The complex of LPS-LBP binds to CD14molecule on the surface of the monocyte/macrophages whichare stimulated to elaborate cytokines, the most important\\nones being TNF- α and IL-1. The effects of these cytokines\\nare as under:\\na) By altering endothelial cell adhesiveness: This results in\\nrecruitment of more neutrophils which liberate free radicalsthat cause vascular injury.\\nb) Promoting nitric oxide synthase : This stimulates increased\\nsynthesis of nitric oxide which is responsible for\\nvasodilatation and hypotension.\\nii) Activation of other inflammatory responses.  Microbial\\ninfection activates other inflammatory cascades which have\\nprofound effects in triggering septic shock. These are asunder:\\na) Activation of complement pathway : End-products C5a and\\nC3a induce microemboli and endothelial damage.\\nb) Activation of mast cells : Histamine is released which\\nincreases capillary permeability.Figure 5.15 Pathogenesis of circulatory shock.\\n111CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics\\nc) Activation of coagulation system : Enhances development of\\nthrombi.\\nd) Activation of kinin system: Released bradykinin cause\\nvasodilatation and increased capillary permeability.\\nThe net result of above mechanisms is vasodilatation and\\nincreased vascular permeability in septic shock. Profoundperipheral vasodilatation and pooling of blood causeshyperdynamic circulation in septic shock, in contrast tohypovolaemic and cardiogenic shock. Increased vascularpermeability causes development of inflammatory oedema.Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is prone todevelop in septic shock due to endothelial cell injury bytoxins. Reduced blood flow produces hypotension,inadequate perfusion of cells and tissues, finally leading toorgan dysfunction.\\nPathophysiology (Stages of Shock)\\nAlthough deterioration of the circulation in shock is a\\nprogressive and continuous phenomenon and compensatorymechanisms become progressively less effective, historicallyshock has been divided arbitrarily into 3 stages (Fig. 5.17):\\n1. Compensated (non-progressive, initial, reversible) shock.\\n2.Progressive decompensated shock.\\n3. Irreversible decompensated shock.\\nCOMPENSATED (NON-PROGRESSIVE, INITIAL,\\nREVERSIBLE) SHOCK.  In the early stage of shock, an\\nattempt is made to maintain adequate cerebral and coro-nary blood supply by redistribution of blood so that thevital organs (brain and heart) are adequately perfused andoxygenated. This is achieved by activation of various neuro-hormonal mechanisms causing widespread vasoconstriction\\nand by fluid conservation by the kidney . If the condition that\\ncaused the shock is adequately treated, the compensatorymechanism may be able to bring about recovery and re-establish the normal circulation; this is called compensatedor reversible shock. These compensatory mechanisms areas under:\\ni) Widespread vasoconstriction.  In response to reduced\\nblood flow (hypotension) and tissue anoxia, the neural and\\nhumoral factors (e.g. baroreceptors, chemoreceptors,catecholamines, renin, and angiotensin-II) are activated. Allthese bring about vasoconstriction, particularly in the vesselsof the skin and abdominal viscera. Widespread vasoconstric-tion is a protective mechanism as it causes increased\\nFigure 5.16 Response of inflammatory mediators in shock.\\nFigure 5.17 Mechanisms and effects of three stages of shock.\\n112SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesperipheral resistance, increased heart rate (tachycardia) and\\nincreased blood pressure. However, in septic shock, there isinitial vasodilatation followed by vasoconstriction. Besides,\\nin severe septic shock there is elevated level of thromboxane\\nA\\n2 which is a potent vasoconstrictor and may augment the\\ncardiac output along with other sympathetic mechanisms.Clinically cutaneous vasoconstriction is responsible for cooland pale skin in initial stage of shock.\\nii) Fluid conservation by the kidney.  In order to compen-\\nsate the actual loss of blood volume in hypovolaemic shock,\\nthe following factors may assist in restoring the blood volumeand improve venous return to the heart:\\nRelease of aldosterone from hypoxic kidney by activation\\nof renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism.\\nRelease of ADH due to decreased effective circulating\\nblood volume.\\nReduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to arteriolar\\nconstriction.\\nShifting of tissue fluids into the plasma due to lowered\\ncapillary hydrostatic pressure (hypotension).\\niii)Stimulation of adrenal medulla. In response to low\\ncardiac output, adrenal medulla is stimulated to release\\nexcess of catecholamines (epinephrine and non-epinephrine)which increase heart rate and try to increase cardiac output.\\nPROGRESSIVE DECOMPENSATED SHOCK.  This is a\\nstage when the patient suffers from some other stress or risk\\nfactors (e.g. pre-existing cardiovascular and lung disease)\\nbesides persistence of the shock so that there is progressive\\ndeterioration. The effects of progressive decompensatedshock due to tissue hypoperfusion are as under:\\ni) Pulmonary hypoperfusion.  Decompensated shock\\nworsens pulmonary perfusion and increases vascular\\npermeability resulting in tachypnoea and adult respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS).\\nii) Tissue ischaemia.  Impaired tissue perfusion causes switch\\nfrom aerobic to anaerobic glycolysis resulting in metabolic\\nlactic acidosis . Lactic acidosis lowers the tissue pH which in\\nturn makes the vasomotor response ineffective. This results\\nin vasodilatation and peripheral pooling of blood.\\nClinically at this stage the patient develops confusion and\\nworsening of renal function.\\nIRREVERSIBLE DECOMPENSATED SHOCK.  When the\\nshock is so severe that in spite of compensatory mechanisms\\nand despite therapy and control of etiologic agent whichcaused the shock, no recovery takes place, it is called\\ndecompensated or irreversible shock. Its effects due to\\nwidespread cell injury include the following:\\ni) Progressive vasodilatation.  During later stages of shock,\\nanoxia damages the capillary and venular wall and arteioles\\nbecome unresponsive to vasoconstrictors listed above andbegin to dilate. Vasodilatation results in peripheral poolingof blood which further deteriorate the effective circulatingblood volume.\\nii) Increased vascular permeability.  Anoxic damage to\\ntissues releases inflammatory mediators which causeincreased vascular permeability. This results in escape of\\nfluid from circulation into the interstitial tissues thus\\ndeteriorating effective circulating blood volume.\\niii) Myocardial depressant factor (MDF).  Progressive fall in\\nthe blood pressure and persistently reduced blood flow to\\nmyocardium causes coronary insufficiency and myocardialischaemia due to release of myocardial depressant factor(MDF). This results in further depression of cardiac function,reduced cardiac output and decreased blood flow.\\niv) Worsening  pulmonary hypoperfusion.  Further\\npulmonary hypoperfusion causes respiratory distress due\\nto pulmonary oedema, tachypnoea and adult respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS).\\nv) Anoxic damage to heart, kidney, brain.  Progressive tissue\\nanoxia causes severe metabolic acidosis due to anaerobic\\nglycolysis. There is release of inflammatory cytokines andother inflammatory mediators and generation of free radicals.Since highly specialised cells of myocardium, proximaltubular cells of the kidney, and neurons of the CNS aredependent solely on aerobic respiration for ATP generation,there is ischaemic cell death in these tissues.\\nvi) Hypercoagulability of blood.  Tissue damage in shock\\nactivates coagulation cascade with release of clot promoting\\nfactor, thromboplastin and release of platelet aggregator,ADP, which contributes to slowing of blood-stream andvascular thrombosis. In this way, hypercoagulability of bloodwith consequent microthrombi impair the blood flow andcause further tissue necrosis.\\nClinically, at this stage the patient has features of coma,\\nworsened heart fu nction and progressive renal failure due\\nto acute tubu\\nlar necrosis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES\\nEventually, shock is characterised by multisystem failure.The morphologic changes in shock are due to hypoxiaresulting in degeneration and necrosis in various organs.\\nThe major organs affected are the brain, heart, lungs and\\nkidneys. Morphologic changes are also noted in theadrenals, gastrointestinal tract, liver and other organs. Thepredominant morphologic changes and their mechanisms\\nare shown in  Fig. 5.17  and described below.\\n1.HYPOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY.  Cerebral ischaemia\\nin compensated shock may produce altered state of\\nconsciousness. However, if the blood pressure falls below50 mmHg as occurs in systemic hypotension inprolonged shock and cardiac arrest, brain suffers from\\nserious ischaemic damage with loss of cortical functions,\\ncoma, and a vegetative state.\\nGrossly , the area supplied by the most distal branches of\\nthe cerebral arteries suffers from severe ischaemic necrosis\\nwhich is usually the border zone between the anterior andmiddle cerebral arteries (Chapter 30).113CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and HaemodynamicsMicroscopically , the changes are noticeable if ischaemia\\nis prolonged for 12 to 24 hours. Neurons, particularly\\nPurkinje cells, are more prone to develop the effects of\\nischaemia. The cytoplasm of the affected neurons is\\nintensely eosinophilic and the nucleus is small pyknotic.\\nDead and dying nerve cells are replaced by gliosis.\\n2. HEART IN SHOCK.  Heart is more vulnerable to the\\neffects of hypoxia than any other organ. Heart is affected\\nin cardiogenic as well as in other forms of shock. Thereare 2 types of morphologic changes in heart in all types ofshock:\\ni)Haemorrhages and necrosis . There may be small or large\\nischaemic areas or infarcts, particularly located in the\\nsubepicardial and subendocardial region.\\nii)Zonal lesions . These are opaque transverse contraction\\nbands in the myocytes near the intercalated disc.\\n3. SHOCK LUNG.  Lungs due to dual blood supply are\\ngenerally not affected by hypovolaemic shock but in septic\\nshock the morphologic changes in lungs are quiteprominent termed ‘shock lung’.\\nGrossly,  the lungs are heavy and wet.\\nMicroscopically,  changes of adult respiratory distress\\nsyndrome (ARDS) are seen (Chapter 17). Briefly, the\\nchanges include congestion, interstitial and alveolaroedema, interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate, alveolar hyalinemembranes, thickening and fibrosis of alveolar septa, andfibrin and platelet thrombi in the pulmonarymicrovasculature.\\n4. SHOCK KIDNEY.  One of the important complications\\nof shock is irreversible renal injury, first noted in persons\\nwho sustained crush injuries in building collapses in airraids in World War II. The renal ischaemia followingsystemic hypotension is considered responsible for renalchanges in shock. The end-result is generally anuria anddeath.\\nGrossly,  the kidneys are soft and swollen. Sectioned\\nsurface shows blurred architectural markings.\\nMicroscopically,  the tubular lesions are seen at all levels\\nof nephron and are referred to as acute tubular necrosis\\n(ATN) which can occur following other causes besidesshock (Chapter 22). If extensive muscle injury orintravascular haemolysis are also associated, peculiarbrown tubular casts are seen.\\n5. ADRENALS IN SHOCK.  The adrenals show stress\\nresponse in shock. This includes release of aldosterone in\\nresponse to hypoxic kidney, release of glucocorticoidsfrom adrenal cortex and catecholamines like adrenalinefrom adrenal medulla. In severe shock, acute adrenalhaemorrhagic necrosis may occur.\\n6. HAEMORRHAGIC GASTROENTEROPATHY.  The\\nhypoperfusion of the alimentary tract in conditions such\\nas shock and cardiac failure may result in mucosal andmural infarction called haemorrhagic gastroenteropathy(Chapter 20). This type of non-occlusive ischaemic injuryof bowel must be distinguished from full-fledgedinfarction in which case the deeper layers of gut (muscu-laris and serosa) are also damaged. In shock due to burns,acute stress ulcers of the stomach or duodenum may occurand are known as Curling’s ulcers.\\nGrossly,  the lesions are multifocal and widely distributed\\nthroughout the bowel. The lesions are superficial ulcers,\\nreddish purple in colour. The adjoining bowel mucosa isoedematous and haemorrhagic.Microscopically,  the involved surface of the bowel shows\\ndilated and congested vessels and haemorrhagic necrosisof the mucosa and sometimes submucosa. Secondaryinfection may supervene and condition may progress intopseudomembranous enterocolitis.\\n7. LIVER IN SHOCK.  Grossly , faint nutmeg appearance\\nis seen.\\nMicroscopically , depending upon the time lapse between\\ninjury and cell death, ischaemic shrinkage, hydropic\\nchange, focal necrosis, or fatty change may be seen. Liverfunction may be impaired.\\n8. OTHER ORGANS.  Other organs such as lymph nodes,\\nspleen and pancreas may also show foci of necrosis in\\nshock. In addition, the patients who survive acute phaseof shock succumb to overwhelming infection due toaltered immune status and host defense mechanism.\\nClinical Features and Complications\\nThe classical features of decompensated shock are\\ncharacterised by depression of 4 vital processes:\\nVery low blood pressure\\nSubnormal temperature\\nFeeble and irregular pulse\\nShallow and sighing respiration\\nIn addition, the patients in shock have pale face, sunken\\neyes, weakness, cold and clammy skin.\\nLife-threatening complications in shock are due to\\nhypoxic cell injury resulting in immuno-inflammatoryresponses and activation of various cascades (clotting,complement, kinin). These include the following*:\\n1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)3. Acute renal failure (ARF)4. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)\\nWith progression of the condition, the patient may develop\\nstupor, coma and death.\\nCIRCULATORY DISTURBANCES OF\\nOBSTRUCTIVE NA TURE\\nTHROMBOSIS\\nDefinition and Effect s\\nThrombosis  is the process of formation of solid mass in\\ncirculation from the constituents of flowing blood; the mass\\nitself is called a thrombus . In contrast, a blood clot  is the mass\\nof coagulated blood formed in vitro  e.g. in a test tube.\\n*Major complications of shock can be remembered from acronym\\nADAM: A = ARDS; D = DIC, A = ARF; M = MODS.114SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesHaematoma  is the extravascular accumulation of blood clot\\ne.g. into the tissues. Haemostatic plugs  are the blood clots\\nformed in healthy individuals at the site of bleeding e.g. in\\ninjury to the blood vessel. In other words, haemostatic plugat the cut end of a blood vessel may be considered thesimplest form of thrombosis. Haemostatic plugs are useful\\nas they stop the escape of blood and plasma, whereas thrombi\\ndeveloping in the unruptured cardiovascular system maybe life-threatening by causing one of the following harmfuleffects:\\n1. Ischaemic injury.  Thrombi may decrease or stop the blood\\nsupply to part of an organ or tissue and cause ischaemia\\nwhich may subsequently result in infarction.\\n2. Thromboembolism.  The thrombus or its part may get\\ndislodged and be carried along in the bloodstream as embolus\\nto lodge in a distant vessel.\\nPathophysiology\\nSince the protective haemostatic plug formed as a result of\\nnormal haemostasis is an example of thrombosis, it is\\nessential to describe thrombogenesis  in relation to the normal\\nhaemostatic mechanism.\\nHuman beings possess inbuilt system by which the blood\\nremains in fluid state normally and guards against thehazards of thrombosis and haemorrhage. However, injury\\nto the blood vessel initiates haemostatic repair mechanismor thrombogenesis.\\nVirchow described three primary events which\\npredispose to thrombus formation (Virchow’s triad):\\nendothelial injury, altered blood flow, and hypercoagulabilityof blood. To this are added the processes that follow theseprimary events: activation of platelets and of clotting system\\n(Fig. 5.18) . These events are discussed below:\\n1. ENDOTHELIAL INJURY.  The integrity of blood vessel\\nwall is important for maintaining normal blood flow. An\\nintact endothelium has the following functions:\\ni) It protects the flowing blood from the thrombogenic\\ninfluence of subendothelium.\\nii\\n) It elaborates a few anti-thrombotic  factors (thrombosis\\ninhibitory factors) e.g.\\na) Heparin-like substance which accelerates the action of\\nantithrombin III and inactivates some other clottingfactors.\\nb) Thrombomodulin which converts thrombin into activator\\nof protein C, an anticoagulant.\\nc) Inhibitors of platelet aggregation such as ADPase, PGI\\n2\\nor prostacyclin.\\nd) Tissue plasminogen activator which accelerates the\\nfibrinolytic activity.\\niii) It can release a few prothrombotic  factors  which have\\nprocoagulant properties (thrombosis favouring factors) e.g.a) Thromboplastin or tissue factor released from endothelial\\ncells.\\nb) von Willebrand factor that causes adherence of platelets\\nto the subendothelium.\\nc) Platelet activating factor which is activator and\\naggregator of platelets.\\nd) Inhibitor of plasminogen activator that suppresses\\nfibrinolysis.\\nVascular injury exposes the subendothelial connective\\ntissue (e.g. collagen, elastin, fibronectin, laminin and\\nFigure 5.18 Sequence of events in thrombogenesis.

C, Following platelet release reaction, ADP is released which causesfurther aggregation of platelets. D, Activated coagulation system forms fibrinstrands in which are entangled some leucocytes and red cells and a tight\\nmeshwork is formed called thrombus.\\n115CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics\\nglycosaminoglycans) which are thrombogenic and thus plays\\nimportant role in initiating haemostasis as well asthrombosis. Injury to vessel wall also causes vasoconstrictionof small blood vessels briefly so as to reduce the blood loss.Endothelial injury is of major significance in the formationof arterial thrombi and thrombi of the heart, especially ofthe left ventricle. A number of factors and conditions maycause vascular injury and predispose to the formation ofthrombi. These are as under:\\ni) Endocardial injury in myocardial infarction, myocarditis,\\ncardiac surgery, prosthetic valves.ii) Ulcerated plaques in advanced atherosclerosis.iii) Haemodynamic stress in hypertension.iv) Arterial diseases.v) Diabetes mellitus.vi) Endogenous chemical agents such as hypercholes-terolaemia, endotoxins.vii) Exogenous chemical agents such as cigarette smoke.\\n2. ROLE OF PLATELETS.  Following endothelial cell injury,\\nplatelets come to play a central role in normal haemostasis\\nas well as in thrombosis. The sequence of events is as under(Fig. 5.19):\\ni) Platelet adhesion.  The platelets in circulation recognise\\nthe site of endothelial injury and adhere to exposed sub-\\nendothelial collagen (primary aggregation) ; von Willebrand’s\\nfactor is required for such adhesion between platelets and\\ncollagen. Normal non-activated platelets have open\\ncanalicular system with cytoplasmic organelles (granules,\\nmitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum) dispersed throughout\\nthe cytoplasm . During the early adhesion process, there is\\ndilatation of canalicular system with formation of pseudo-\\npods and the cytoplasmic organelles shift to the centre ofthe cell.\\nii)\\nPlatelet release reaction.  The activated platelets then\\nundergo release reaction by which the platelet granules are\\nreleased to the exterior. Two main types of platelet granulesare released:a)Alpha granules  containing fibrinogen, fibronectin, platelet-\\nderived growth factor, platelet factor 4 (an antiheparin) andcationic proteins.\\nb)Dense bodies  containing ADP (adenosine diphosphate),\\nionic calcium, 5-HT (serotonin), histamine and epinephrine.\\nAs a sequel to platelet activation and release reaction,\\nthe phospholipid complex-platelet factor 3 gets activated\\nwhich plays important role in the intrinsic pathway ofcoagulation.\\niii)Platelet aggregation.  Following release of ADP, a potent\\nplatelet aggregating agent, aggregation of additional platelets\\ntakes place (secondary aggregation) . This results in formation\\nof temporary haemostatic plug. However, stable haemostaticplug is formed by the action of fibrin, thrombin andthromboxane A\\n2.\\n3. ROLE OF COAGULATION SYSTEM.  Coagulation\\nmechanism is the conversion of the plasma fibrinogen intosolid mass of fibrin. The coagulation system is involved inboth haemostatic process and thrombus formation. Fig. 5.20\\nshows the schematic representation of the cascade of intrinsic(blood) pathway, the extrinsic (tissue) pathway, and the\\ncommon pathway leading to formation of fibrin polymers.\\ni) In the intrinsic pathway,  contact with abnormal surface\\nleads to activation of factor XII and the sequential interactions\\nof factors XI, IX, VIII and finally factor X, alongwith calcium\\nions (factor IV) and platelet factor 3.\\nii\\n) In the extrinsic pathway,  tissue damage results in the\\nrelease of tissue factor or thromboplastin. Tissue factor on\\ninteraction with factor VII activates factor X.\\niii)The common pathway  begins where both intrinsic and\\nextrinsic pathways converge to activate factor X which forms\\na complex with factor Va and platelet factor 3, in the presenceof calcium ions. This complex activates prothrombin (factorII) to thrombin (factor IIa) which, in turn, converts fibrinogento fibrin. Initial monomeric fibrin is polymerised to forminsoluble fibrin by activation of factor XIII.Figure 5.19 Activation of platelets during haemostatic plug formation and thrombogenesis.

C, Platelet release reaction, showing release of granules to the exterior.\\nD, Platelet aggregation forms a tight plug.\\n116SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nRegulation of coagulation system.  The blood is kept in fluid\\nstate normally and coagulation system kept in check by\\ncontrolling mechanisms. These are as under:\\na)Protease inhibitors.  These act on coagulation factors so as\\nto oppose the formation of thrombin e.g. antithrombin III,\\nprotein C, C1 inactivator, α1-antitrypsin, α2-macroglobulin.\\nb)Fibrinolytic system . Plasmin, a potent fibrinolytic enzyme,\\nis formed by the action of plasminogen activator onplasminogen present in the normal plasma. Two types ofplasminogen activators (PA) are identified:\\nTissue-type PA  derived from endothelial cells and\\nleucocytes.\\nUrokinase-like PA  present in the plasma.\\nPlasmin so formed acts on fibrin to destroy the clot and\\nproduces fibrin split products (FSP).\\n4. ALTERATION OF BLOOD FLOW.  Turbulence  means\\nunequal flow while stasis means slowing.\\ni) Normally,  there is axial flow of blood in which the most\\nrapidly-moving central stream consists of leucocytes and red\\ncells. The platelets are present in the slow-moving laminarstream adjacent to the central stream while the peripheralstream consists of most slow-moving cell-free plasma closeto endothelial layer (Fig. 5.21,A) .\\nii) Turbulence and stasis  occur in thrombosis  in which the\\nnormal axial flow of blood is disturbed. When blood slowsdown, the blood cells including platelets marginate to theperiphery and form a kind of pavement close to endothelium(margination and pavementing) (Fig. 5.21,B) . While stasis\\nallows a higher release of oxygen from the blood, turbulencemay actually injure the endothelium resulting in depositionof platelets and fibrin. Formation of arterial and cardiacFigure 5.20 Schematic representation of pathways of coagulation mechanism and fibrinolytic system.\\nFigure 5.21 Alterations in flow of blood.\\n117CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamicsthrombi is facilitated by turbulence  in the blood flow, while\\nstasis  initiates the venous thrombi even without evidence of\\nendothelial injury.\\n5. HYPERCOAGULABILITY OF BLOOD.  The occurrence\\nof thrombosis in some conditions such as in nephrotic\\nsyndrome, advanced cancers, extensive trauma, burns andduring puerperium is explained on the basis of hypercoagul-ability of blood. The effect of hypercoagulability on\\nthrombosis is favoured by advancing age, smoking, use of\\noral contraceptives and obesity. Hypercoagulability mayoccur by the following changes in the composition of blood:i)Increase in coagulation factors  e.g. fibrinogen, prothrombin,\\nfactor VIIa, VIIIa and Xa.ii) Increase in platelet count  and their adhesiveness.\\niii)Decreased levels of coagulation inhibitors  e.g. antithrombin\\nIII, fibrin split products.\\nPredisposing Factors\\nA number of primary (genetic) and secondary (acquired)\\nfactors favour thrombosis.\\nPrimary (Genetic) factors:\\ni)\\nDeficiency of antithrombin\\nii)Deficiency of protein C or S\\niii)\\nDefects in fibrinolysis\\niv) Mutation in factor V\\nSecondary (acquired) factors:\\na) Risk factors:i) Advanced age\\nii) Prolonged bed-rest\\niii) Immobilisationiv) Cigarette smoking\\nb) Clinical conditions  predisposing to thrombosis:\\ni) Heart diseases (e.g. myocardial infarction, CHF,\\nrheumatic mitral stenosis, cardiomyopathy)\\nii)  Vascular diseases (e.g. atherosclerosis, aneurysms of the\\naorta and other vessels, varicosities of leg veins)\\niii) Hyp ercoagulable conditions (e.g. polycythaemia,\\ndehydration, nephrotic syndrome , disseminated cancers)iv)  Shock\\nv) Tissue damage e.g. trauma, fractures, burns, surgery\\nvi) Late pregnancy and puerperium\\nvii) Certain drugs (e.g. anaesthetic agents, oral contra-ceptives).\\nMorphologic Features\\nThrombosis may occur in the heart, arteries, veins and the\\ncapillaries. Beside the differences in mechanisms of thrombusformation at these sites, the clinical effects of these are evenmore different. Arterial thrombi produce ischaemia and\\ninfarction, whereas cardiac and venous thrombi cause\\nembolism.\\nThe general morphologic features of thrombi are as\\nunder:\\nGrossly,  thrombi may be of various shapes, sizes and\\ncomposition depending upon the site of origin. Arterial\\nthrombi tend to be white and mural while the venous\\nthrombi are red and occlusive. Mixed or laminatedthrombi are also common and consist of alternate whiteand red layers called lines of Zahn. Red thrombi are soft,\\nred and gelatinous whereas white thrombi are firm and\\npale.\\nMicroscopically,  the composition of thrombus is deter-\\nmined by the rate of flow of blood i.e. whether it is formed\\nin the rapid arterial and cardiac circulation, or in the slowmoving flow in veins. The lines of Zahn are formed by\\nalternate layers of light-staining aggregated platelets\\nadmixed with fibrin meshwork and dark-staining layerof red cells. Red (venous) thrombi have more abundantred cells, leucocytes and platelets entrapped in fibrin\\nmeshwork\\n. Thus, red thrombi closely resemble blood clots\\nin vitro  (Fig. 5.22) .\\nRed thrombi (antemortem) have to be distinguished from\\npostmortem clots (Table 5.5) .\\nFigure 5.22 Thrombus in an artery. The thrombus is adherent to the arterial wall and is seen occluding most of the lumen. It shows lines of\\nZahn composed of granular-looking platelets and fibrin meshwork with entangled red cells and leucocytes.\\n118SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques Origin of Thrombi\\nThrombi may arise from the heart, arteries, veins or in\\nmicrocirculation.\\nCARDIAC THROMBI.  Thrombi may form in any of the\\nchambers of the heart and on the valve cusps. They are more\\ncommon in the atrial appendages, especially of the rightatrium, and on mitral and aortic valves called vegetationswhich may be seen in infective endocarditis and non-bacterialthrombotic endocarditis (Chapter 16). Cardiac thrombi aremural (non-occlusive) as are the mural thrombi encounteredin the aorta in atherosclerosis and in aneurysmal dilatations.Rarely, large round thrombus may form and obstruct themitral valve and is called ball-valve thrombus. Agonal thrombi\\nare formed shortly before death and may occur in either orboth the ventricles. They are composed mainly of fibrin.\\nARTERIAL AND VENOUS THROMBI.  The examples of\\nmajor forms of vascular thrombi are as under:\\nArterial thrombi:\\ni) Aorta : aneurysms, arteritis.\\nii) Coronary arteries: atherosclerosis.\\niii) Mesenteric artery : atherosclerosis, arteritis.\\niv) Arteries of limbs:  atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus,\\nBuerger’s disease, Raynaud’s disease.v) Renal artery:  atherosclerosis, arteritis.\\nvi) Cerebral artery : atherosclerosis, vasculitis.\\nVenous thrombi:i) Veins of lower limbs:  deep veins of legs, varicose veins.\\nii) Popliteal, femoral and iliac veins:  postoperative stage,\\npostpartum.iii) Pulmonary veins:  CHF, pulmonary hypertension.\\niv) Hepatic and portal vein:  portal hypertension.v) Superior vena cava:  infections in head and neck.\\nvi) Inferior vena cava:  extension of thrombus from hepatic vein.\\nvii) Mesenteric veins: volvulus, intestinal obstruction.\\nviii) Renal vein:  renal amyloidosis.\\nDistinguishing features between thrombi formed in\\nrapidly-flowing arterial circulation and slow-moving venousblood are given in Table 5.6 .\\nCAPILLARY THROMBI.  Minute thrombi composed mainly\\nof packed red cells are formed in the capillaries in acuteinflammatory lesions, vasculitis and in disseminatedintravascular coagulation (DIC).\\nFate of Thrombus\\nThe possible fate of thrombi can be as under (Fig. 5.23):\\n1.RESOLUTION.  Thrombus activates the fibrinolytic\\nsystem with consequent release of plasmin which may\\ndissolve the thrombus completely resulting in resolution.Usually, lysis is complete in small venous thrombi while large\\nthrombi may not be dissolved. Fibrinolytic activity can be\\naccentuated by administration of thrombolytic substances(e.g. urokinase, streptokinase), especially in the early stagewhen fibrin is in monomeric form.\\n2.\\nORGANISATION.  If the thrombus is not removed, it\\nstarts getting organised. Phagocytic cells (neutrophils and\\nmacrophages) appear and begin to phagocytose fibrin andcell debris. The proteolytic enzymes liberated by leucocytesand endothelial cells start digesting coagulum. Capillariesgrow into the thrombus from the site of its attachment andfibroblasts start invading the thrombus. Thus, fibrovasculargranulation tissue is formed which subsequently becomesdense and less vascular and is covered over by endothelial\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 5.5: Distinguishing Features of Antemortem Thrombi and Postmortem Clots.\\nFeature Antemortem Thrombi Postmortem Clots\\n1.

Effects Ischaemia leading to infarcts e.g. in the Thromboembolism, oedema, skin ulcers, poor\\nheart, brain etc wound healing119CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics\\ncells. The thrombus in this way is excluded from the vascular\\nlumen and becomes part of vessel wall. The new vascularchannels in it may be able to re-establish the blood flow,called recanalisation. The fibrosed thrombus may undergohyalinisation and calcification e.g. phleboliths in the pelvicveins.\\n3. PROPAGATION.  The thrombus may enlarge in size due\\nto more and more deposition from the constituents of flowing\\nblood. In this way, it may ultimately cause obstruction ofsome important vessel.\\n4. THROMBOEMBOLISM.  The thrombi in early stage and\\ninfected thrombi are quite friable and may get detached from\\nthe vessel wall. These are released in part or completely inbloodstream as emboli which produce ill-effects at the siteof their lodgement (page 120).\\nClinical Effects\\nThese depend upon the site of thrombi, rapidity of formation,\\nand nature of thrombi.\\n1. Cardiac thrombi.  Large thrombi in the heart may cause\\nsudden death by mechanical obstruction of blood flow or\\nthrough thromboembolism to vital organs.\\n2. Arterial thrombi.  These cause ischaemic necrosis of the\\ndeprived part (infarct) which may lead to gangrene. Sudden\\ndeath may occur following thrombosis of coronary artery.\\n3. Venous thrombi (Phlebothrombosis).  These may cause\\nfollowing effects:\\ni)Thromboembolism\\nii)Oedema of area drained\\niii)\\nPoor wound healing\\niv) Skin ulcerv) Painful thrombosed veins (thrombophlebitis)vi) Painful white leg (phlegmasia alba dolens) due toileofemoral venous thrombosis in postpartum casesvii) Thrombophlebitis migrans in cancer.\\n4. Capillary thrombi.  Microthrombi in microcirculation\\nmay give rise to disseminated intravascular coagulation\\n(DIC).EMBOLISM\\nDefinition and Types\\nEmbolism  is the process of partial or complete obstruction of\\nsome part of the cardiovascular system by any mass carried\\nin the circulation; the transported intravascular mass\\ndetached from its site of origin is called an embolus . Most\\nusual forms of emboli (90%) are thromboemboli i.e.\\noriginating from thrombi or their parts detached from thevessel wall.\\nEmboli may be of various types:\\nA.Depending upon the matter in the emboli:\\ni) Solid  e.g. detached thrombi (thromboemboli), athero-\\nmatous material, tumour cell clumps, tissue fragments,parasites, bacterial clumps, foreign bodies.\\nii\\n) Liquid  e.g. fat globules, amniotic fluid, bone marrow.\\niii) Gaseous  e.g. air, other gases.\\nB. Depending upon whether infected or not:\\ni) Bland , when sterile.\\nii) Septic, when infected.\\nC. Depending upon the source of the emboli:\\ni) Cardiac emboli  from left side of the heart e.g. emboli\\noriginating from atrium and atrial appendages, infarct in the\\nleft ventricle, vegetations of endocarditis.\\nii) Arterial emboli  e.g. in systemic arteries in the brain, spleen,\\nkidney, intestine.iii) Venous emboli  e.g. in pulmonary arteries.\\niv) Lymphatic emboli can also occur.\\nD. Depending upon the flow of blood,  two special types\\nof emboli are mentioned:\\ni) Paradoxical embolus . An embolus which is carried from\\nthe venous side of circulation to the arterial side or vice versa\\nis called paradoxical or crossed embolus e.g. through\\narteriovenous communication such as in patent foramen\\novale, septal defect of the heart, and arteriovenous shunts inthe lungs.Figure 5.23 Fate of thrombus.\\n120SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nii) Retrograde embolus . An embolus which travels against the\\nflow of blood is called retrograde embolus e.g. metastatic\\ndeposits in the spine from carcinoma prostate. The spreadoccurs by retrograde embolism through intraspinal veinswhich carry tumour emboli from large thoracic andabdominal veins due to increased pressure in body cavitiese.g. during coughing or straining.\\nSome of the important types of embolism are tabulated\\nin Table 5.7  and described below:\\nThromboembolism\\nA detached thrombus or part of thrombus constitutes the\\nmost common type of embolism. These may arise in thearterial or venous circulation (Fig. 5.24):\\nArterial (systemic) thromboembolism.  Arterial emboli may\\nbe derived from the following sources:\\nA.Causes within the heart  (80-85%): These are mural\\nthrombi in the left atrium or left ventricle, vegetations on\\nthe mitral or aortic valves, prosthetic heart valves andcardiomyopathy.\\nB.Causes within  the arteries:  These include emboli develop-\\ning in relation to atherosclerotic plaques, aortic aneurysms,pulmonary veins and paradoxical arterial emboli from the\\nsystemic venous circulation.\\nThe effects  of arterial emboli depend upon their size, site\\nof lodgement, and adequacy of collateral circulation. If thevascular occlusion occurs, the following ill-effects may result:\\ni) Infarction  of the organ or its affected part e.g. ischaemic\\nnecrosis in the lower limbs (70-75%), spleen, kidneys, brain,\\nintestine.\\nii\\n) Gangrene  following infarction in the lower limbs if the\\ncollateral circulation is inadequate.iii) Arteritis and mycotic aneurysm  formation from bacterial\\nendocarditis.\\niv) Myocardial infarction  may occur following coronary\\nembolism.\\nv) Sudden death  may result from coronary embolism or\\nembolism in the middle cerebral artery.\\nVenous thromboembolism.  Venous emboli may arise from\\nthe following sources:\\ni) Thrombi in the veins of the lower legs are the most\\ncommon cause of venous emboli.ii\\n) Thrombi in the pelvic veins.\\niii) Thrombi in the veins of the upper limbs.iv) Thrombosis in cavernous sinus of the brain.v) Thrombi in the right side of heart.\\nThe most significant effect  of venous embolism is\\nobstruction of pulmonary arterial circulation leading topulmonary embolism described below.\\nPulmonary Thromboembolism\\nDEFINITION.  Pulmonary embolism is the most common\\nand fatal form of venous thromboembolism in which there\\nis occlusion of pulmonary arterial tree by thromboemboli.Pulmonary thrombosis as such is uncommon and may occurin pulmonary atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension.Differentiation of pulmonary thrombosis from pulmonarythromboembolism is tabulated in Table 5.8 .\\nETIOLOGY.  Pulmonary emboli are more common in\\nhospitalised or bed-ridden patients, though they can occurin ambulatory patients as well. The causes are as follows:\\ni)Thrombi originating from large veins of lower legs (such\\nas popliteal, femoral and iliac) are the cause in 95% of\\npulmonary emboli.\\nii)\\nLess common sources include thrombi in varicosities of\\nsuperficial veins of the legs, and pelvic veins such as peri-\\nprostatic, periovarian, uterine and broad ligament veins.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Detachment of thrombi from any of the\\nabove-mentioned sites produces a thrombo-embolus that\\nflows through venous drainage into the larger veins draininginto right side of the heart.\\nIf the thrombus is large, it is impacted at the bifurcation\\nof the main pulmonary artery (saddle embolus),  or may be\\nfound in the right ventricle or its outflow tract.\\nMore commonly, there are multiple emboli , or a large\\nembolus may be fragmented into many smaller emboli which\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 5.7: Important Types of Embolism.\\nType Common Origin\\n1.

In this way, pulmonary emboli mayreach systemic circulation.\\nCONSEQUENCES OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM.\\nPulmonary embolism occurs more commonly as a compli-cation in patients of acute or chronic debilitating diseaseswho are immobilised for a long duration. Women in theirreproductive period are at higher risk such as in latepregnancy, following delivery and with use of contraceptivepills. The effects of pulmonary embolism depend mainly onthe size of the occluded vessel, the number of emboli, andon the cardiovascular status of the patient. The followingconsequences can result (Fig. 5.25):\\ni) Sudden death.  Massive pulmonary embolism results in\\ninstantaneous death, without occurrence of chest pain ordyspnoea. However, if the death is somewhat delayed, theclinical features resemble myocardial infarction i.e. severechest pain, dyspnoea and shock.\\nii)Acute cor pulmonale.  Numerous small emboli may\\nobstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute\\nright heart failure. Another mechanism is by release ofvasoconstrictor substances from platelets or by reflexvasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels.iii)\\nPulmonary infarction.  Obstruction of relatively small-\\nsized pulmonary arterial branches may result in pulmonary\\ninfarction (page 127). The clinical features include chest paindue to fibrinous pleuritis, haemoptysis and dyspnoea dueto reduced functioning pulmonary parenchyma.\\niv) Pulmonary haemorrhage.  Obstruction of terminal\\nbranches (endarteries) leads to central pulmonary\\nhaemorrhage. The clinical features are haemoptysis,dyspnoea, and less commonly, chest pain due to centrallocation of pulmonary haemorrhage. Sometimes, there maybe concomitant pulmonary infarction.\\nv) Resolution.  Vast majority of small pulmonary emboli\\n(60-80%) are resolved by fibrinolytic activity. These patients\\nare clinically silent owing to bronchial circulation so that lungparenchyma is adequately perfused.\\nvi) Pulmonary hypertension, chronic cor pulmonale and\\npulmonary arteriosclerosis.  These are the sequelae of\\nmultiple small thromboemboli undergoing healing ratherthan resolution.\\nSystemic Embolism\\nThis is the type of arterial embolism that originates comm-\\nonly from thrombi in the diseased heart, especially in the\\nleft ventricle. These diseases of heart include myocardialinfraction, cardiomyopathy, RHD, congenital heart disease,infective endocarditis, and prosthetic cardiac valves. Thesearterial emboli invariably cause infarction at the sites oflodgement which include, in descending order of frequency,\\nlower extremity, brain, and internal visceral organs (spleen,\\nkidneys, intestines). Thus, the effects and sites of arterial emboli\\nare in striking contrast to venous emboli  which are often lodged\\nin the lungs.\\nFat Embolism\\nObstruction of arterioles and capillaries by fat globules\\nconstitutes fat embolism. If the obstruction in the circulation\\nis by fragments of adipose tissue, it is called fat-tissueembolism.\\nETIOLOGY.  Following are the important causes of fat\\nembolism:\\ni) Traumatic causes:\\nTrauma to bones  is the most common cause of fat embolism\\ne.g. in fractures of long bones leading to passage of fatty\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 5.8: Contrasting Features of Pulmonary Thrombosis and Pulmonary Thromboembolism.\\nFeature Pulmonary Thrombosis Pulmonary Thromboembolism\\n1.

The following mechanisms are proposed\\nto explain the pathogenesis of fat embolism. These may be\\nacting singly or in combination.\\ni)Mechanical theory.  Mobilisation of fluid fat may occur\\nfollowing trauma to the bone or soft tissues. The fat globules\\nreleased from the injured area may enter venous circulationand finally most of the fat is arrested in the small vessels inthe lungs. Some of the fat globules may further pass throughinto the systemic circulation to lodge in other organs.\\ni\\ni) Emulsion instability theory.  This theory explains the\\npathogenesis of fat embolism in non-traumatic cases.\\nAccording to this theory, fat emboli are formed by aggrega-tion of plasma lipids (chylomicrons and fatty acids) due todisturbance in natural emulsification of fat.\\niii)Intravascular coagulation theory.  In stress, release of\\nsome factor activates disseminated intravascular coagulation\\n(DIC) and aggregation of fat emboli.\\niv) Toxic injury theory.  According to this theory, the small\\nblood vessels of lungs are chemically injured by high plasma\\nlevels of free fatty acid, resulting in increased vascularpermeability and consequent pulmonary oedema.\\nCONSEQUENCES OF FAT EMBOLISM.  The effects of fat\\nembolism depend upon the size and quantity of fat globules,\\nand whether or not the emboli pass through the lungs intothe systemic circulation.\\ni)Pulmonary fat embolism.  In patients dying after frac-\\ntures of bones, presence of numerous fat emboli in the\\ncapillaries of the lung is a frequent autopsy finding becausethe small fat globules are not likely to appreciably obstructthe vast pulmonary vascular bed. However, widespreadobstruction of pulmonary circulation due to extensivepulmonary embolism can occur and result in sudden death.\\nMicroscopically,  the lungs show hyperaemia, oedema,\\npetechial haemorrhages and changes of adult respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS). Pulmonary infarction isusually not a feature of fat embolism because of the smallsize of globules. In routine stains, the fat globules in thepulmonary arteries, capillaries and alveolar spaces appearas vacuoles. Frozen section is essential for confirmationof globules by fat stains such as Sudan dyes (Sudan black,Sudan III and IV), oil red O and osmic acid.i\\ni) Systemic fat embolism.  Some of the fat globules may\\npass through the pulmonary circulation such as via patentforamen ovale, arteriovenous shunts in the lungs andvertebral venous plexuses, and get lodged in the capillariesof organs like the brain, kidney, skin etc.\\nBrain.  The pathologic findings in the brain are\\npetechial haemorrhages on the leptomeninges and minutehaemorrhages in the parenchyma.Microscopically,  microinfarct of brain, oedema and\\nhaemorrhages are seen. The CNS manifestations includedelirium, convulsions, stupor, coma and sudden death.\\nKidney. Renal fat embolism present in the glomerular\\ncapillaries, may cause decreased glomerular filtration.Other effects include tubular damage and renalinsufficiency.\\nOther organs.  Besides the brain and kidneys, other\\nfindings in systemic fat embolism are petechiae in the skin,conjunctivae, serosal surfaces, fat globules in the urineand sputum.\\nGas Embolism\\nAir, nitrogen and other gases can produce bubbles within\\nthe circulation and obstruct the blood vessels causing damageto tissue. Two main forms of gas embolism—air embolismand decompression sickness are described below.\\nAir Embolism\\nAir embolism occurs when air is introduced into venous or\\narterial circulation.\\nVENOUS AIR EMBOLISM.  Air may be sucked into\\nsystemic veins under the following circumstances:\\ni)Operations on head and neck, and trauma.  The\\naccidental opening of a major vein of the neck like jugular,\\nor neck wounds involving the major neck veins, may allowair to be drawn into venous circulation.\\ni\\ni) Obstetrical operations and trauma.  During childbirth by\\nnormal vaginal delivery, caesarean section, abortions and\\nother procedures, fatal air embolism may result from theentrance of air into the opened-up uterine venous sinusesand endometrial veins.\\niii)Intravenous infusion of blood and fluid.  Air embolism\\nmay occur during intravenous blood or fluid infusions if only\\npositive pressure is employed.\\niv) Angiography.  During angiographic procedures, air may\\nbe entrapped into a large vein causing air embolism.\\nThe effects  of venous air embolism depend upon the\\nfollowing factors:\\ni) Amount of air  introduced into the circulation. The volume\\nof air necessary to cause death is variable but usually 100-\\n150 ml of air entry is considered fatal.\\nii) Rapidity  of entry of a smaller volume of air is important\\ndeterminant of a fatal outcome.iii) Position of the patient  during or soon after entry of air is\\nanother factor. The air bubbles may ascend into the superior\\nvena cava if the position of head is higher than the trunk(e.g. in upright position) and reach the brain.123CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamicsiv) General condition  of the patient e.g. in severely ill patients,\\nas little as 40 ml of air may have serious results.\\nThe mechanism of death is by entrapment of air emboli\\nin the pulmonary arterial trunk in the right heart. If bubbles\\nof air in the form of froth pass further out into pulmonaryarterioles, they cause widespread vascular occlusions. If\\ndeath from pulmonary air embolism is suspected, the heart\\nand pulmonary artery should be opened in situ  under water\\nso that escaping froth or foam formed by mixture of air andblood can be detected.\\nARTERIAL AIR EMBOLISM.  Entry of air into pulmonary\\nvein or its tributaries may occur in the following conditions:\\ni)Cardiothoracic surgery and trauma.  Arterial air\\nembolism may occur following thoracic operations,\\nthoracocentesis, rupture of the lung, penetrating wounds ofthe lung, artificial pneumothorax etc.\\nii)\\nParadoxical air embolism.  This may occur due to passage\\nof venous air emboli to the arterial side of circulation through\\na patent foramen ovale or via pulmonary arteriovenous\\nshunts.\\niii)Arteriography.  During arteriographic procedures, air\\nembolism may occur.\\nThe effects  of arterial air embolism are in the form of\\ncertain characteristic features:\\ni) Marble skin due to blockage of cutaneous vessels.ii) Air bubbles in the retinal vessels seen ophthalmos-\\ncopically.\\niii) Pallor of the tongue due to occlusion of a branch of lingualartery.iv) Coronary or cerebral arterial air embolism may cause\\nsudden death by much smaller amounts of air than in the\\nvenous air embolism.\\nDecompression Sickness\\nThis is a specialised form of gas embolism known by various\\nnames such as caisson’s disease, divers’ palsy or\\naeroembolism.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Decompression sickness is produced\\nwhen the individual decompresses suddenly, either from\\nhigh atmospheric pressure to normal level, or from normal\\npressure to low atmospheric pressure.\\nIn divers, workers in caissons (diving-bells), offshore\\ndrilling and tunnels, who descend  to high atmospheric\\npressure, increased amount of atmospheric gases (mainlynitrogen; others are O\\n2, CO2) are dissolved in blood and tissue\\nfluids. When such an individual ascends too rapidly i.e.\\ncomes to normal level suddenly from high atmospheric\\npressure, the gases come out of the solution as minutebubbles, particularly in fatty tissues which have affinity fornitrogen. These bubbles may coalesce together to form large\\nemboli.\\nIn aeroembolism, seen in those who ascend  to high\\naltitudes or air flight in unpressurised cabins, the individuals\\nare exposed to sudden decompression from low atmosphericpressure to normal levels. This results in similar effects as indivers and workers in caissons.\\nEFFECTS.  The effects of decompression sickness depend\\nupon the following:\\nDepth or altitude reached\\nDuration of exposure to altered pressure\\nRate of ascent or descent\\nGeneral condition of the individual\\nPathologic changes are more pronounced in sudden\\ndecompression from high pressure to normal levels than in\\nthose who decompress from low pressure to normal levels.\\nThe changes are more serious in obese persons as nitrogengas is more soluble in fat than in body fluids.\\nClinical effects of decompression sickness are of 2 types—\\nacute and chronic.\\nAcute form  occurs due to acute obstruction of small blood\\nvessels in the vicinity of joints and skeletal muscles. Thecondition is clinically characterised by the following:\\ni)‘The bends’ , as the patient doubles up in bed due to acute\\npain in joints, ligaments and tendons.\\nii)‘The chokes’  occur due to accumulation of bubbles in the\\nlungs, resulting in acute respiratory distress.iii)Cerebral effects may manifest in the form of vertigo, coma,\\nand sometimes death.\\nChronic form  is due to foci of ischaemic necrosis\\nthroughout body, especially the skeletal system. Ischaemic\\nnecrosis may be due to embolism per se,  but other factors\\nsuch as platelet activation, intravascular coagulation and\\nhypoxia might contribute. The features of chronic form areas under:\\ni) Avascular necrosis of bones  e.g. head of femur, tibia,\\nhumerus.\\nii) Neurological symptoms  may occur due to ischaemic\\nnecrosis in the central nervous system. These include\\nparaesthesias and paraplegia.\\niii) Lung involvement  in the form of haemorrhage, oedema,\\nemphysema and atelactasis may be seen. These result indyspnoea, nonproductive cough and chest pain.\\niv) Skin manifestations  include itching, patchy erythema,\\ncyanosis and oedema.\\nv) Other organs  like parenchymal cells of the liver and\\npancreas may show lipid vacuoles.\\nAmniotic Fluid Embolism\\nThis is the most serious, unpredictable and unpreventible\\ncause of maternal mortality. During labour and in theimmediate postpartum period, the contents of amniotic fluidmay enter the uterine veins and reach right side of the heart\\nresulting in fatal complications. The amniotic fluid\\ncomponents which may be found in uterine veins, pulmonaryartery and vessels of other organs are: epithelial squames,vernix caseosa, lanugo hair, bile from meconium, and mucus.\\nThe mechanism by which these amniotic fluid contents enter\\nthe maternal circulation is not clear. Possibly, they gain entry124SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniqueseither through tears in the myometrium and endocervix, or\\nthe amniotic fluid is forced into uterine sinusoids by vigorousuterine contractions.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Notable changes are seen\\nin the lungs such as haemorrhages, congestion, oedema\\nand changes of ARDS, and dilatation of right side of theheart. These changes are associated with identifiableamniotic fluid contents within the pulmonary micro-circulation.\\nThe clinical syndrome  of amniotic fluid embolism is\\ncharacterised by the following features:\\nSudden respiratory distress and dyspnoea\\nDeep cyanosis\\nCardiovascular shock\\nConvulsions\\nComa\\nnexpected death\\nThe cause of death  may not be obvious but can occur as a\\nresult of the following mechanisms:\\ni) Mechanical blockage of the pulmonary circulation in\\nextensive embolism.\\nii) Anaphylactoid reaction to amniotic fluid components.\\niii)Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to\\nliberation of thromboplastin by amniotic fluid.iv) Haemorrhagic manifestations due to thrombocytopenia\\nand afibrinogenaemia.\\nAtheroembolism\\nAtheromatous plaques, especially from aorta, may get eroded\\nto form atherosclerotic emboli which are then lodged inmedium-sized and small arteries. These emboli consist ofcholesterol crystals, hyaline debris and calcified material, andmay evoke foreign body reaction at the site of lodgement.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Pathologic changes and\\ntheir effects in atheroembolism are as under:\\ni)Ischaemia, atrophy and necrosis of tissue distal to the\\noccluded vessel.ii) Infarcts in the organs affected such as the kidneys,\\nspleen, brain and heart.\\niii) Gangrene in the lower limbs.iv) Hypertension, if widespread renal vascular lesions are\\npresent.\\nTumour Embolism\\nMalignant tumour cells invade the local blood vessels andmay form tumour emboli to be lodged elsewhere, producingmetastatic tumour deposits. Notable examples are clear cellcarcinoma of kidney, carcinoma of the lung, malignantmelanoma etc (Chapter 8).\\nMiscellaneous Emboli\\nVarious other endogenous and exogenous substances may\\nact as emboli. These are:i)Fragments of tissueii\\n) Placental fragments\\niii) Red cell aggregates (sludging)iv) Bacteriav) Parasitesvi) Barium emboli following enemavii) Foreign bodies e.g. needles, talc, sutures, bullets, cathetersetc.\\nISCHAEMIA\\nDEFINITION.  Ischaemia is defined as deficient blood supply\\nto part of a tissue. The cessation of blood supply may be\\ncomplete  (complete ischaemia) or partial  (partial ischaemia).\\nThe adverse effects of ischaemia may result from 3 ways:\\n1.Hypoxia due to deprivation of oxygen to tissues; this is\\nthe most important and common cause. It may be of 4 types:\\ni) Hypoxic hypoxia  : due to low oxygen in arterial blood.\\nii) Anaemic hypoxia : due to low level of haemoglobin in blood.\\niii) Stagnant hypoxia : due to inadequate blood supply.\\niv) Histotoxic hypoxia : low oxygen uptake due to cellular\\ntoxicity.\\n2.Malnourishment of cells due to inadequate supply of\\nnutrients to the tissue (i.e. glucose, amino acids); this is less\\nimportant.\\n3.\\nInadequate clearance of metabolites  which results in\\naccumulation of metabolic waste-products in the affected\\ntissue; this is relevant in some conditions such as muscleacheafter ischaemia from heavy exercise.\\nETIOLOGY.  A number of causes may produce ischaemia.\\nThese causes are discussed below with regard to different\\nlevels of blood vessels:\\n1.Causes in the heart.  Inadequate cardiac output resulting\\nfrom heart block, ventricular arrest and fibrillation from\\nvarious causes may cause hypoxic injury to the brain.i)\\nIf the arrest continues for 15 seconds, consciousness is lost.\\nii) If the condition lasts for more than 4 minutes, irreversibleischaemic damage to the brain occurs.iii) If it is prolonged for more than 8 minutes, death isinevitable.\\n2. Causes in the arteries.  The commonest and most impor-\\ntant causes of ischaemia are due to obstruction in arterial\\nblood supply. These are as under:\\ni) Luminal occlusion  of artery:\\na) Thrombosis\\nb) Embolism\\nii) Causes in the arterial wall s:\\na) Vasospasm (e.g. in Raynaud’s disease)b) Hypothermia, ergotismc) Arteriosclerosisd) Polyarteritis nodosae) Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s disease)f) Severed vessel wall\\niii) Outside pressure  on an artery:\\na) Ligatureb) Tourniquetc) Tight plaster, bandagesd) Torsion.125CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics3. Causes in the veins.  Blockage of venous drainage may\\nlead to engorgement and obstruction to arterial blood supply\\nresulting in ischaemia. The examples include the following:i)Luminal occlusion of vein:a) Thrombosis of mesenteric veinsb) Cavernous sinus thrombosis\\nii) Causes in the vessel wall of vein :\\na) Varicose veins of the legs\\niii) Outside pressure  on vein:\\na)  Strangulated herniab)  Intussusceptionc) Volvulus\\n4. Causes in the microcirculation.  Ischaemia may result\\nfrom occlusion of arterioles, capillaries and venules. Thecauses are as under:\\ni) Luminal occlusion in microvasculature:\\na) By red cells e.g. in sickle cell anaemia, red cells parasitisedby malaria, acquired haemolytic anaemia, sludging of theblood.b)  By white cells e.g. in chronic myeloid leukaemiac)  By fibrin e.g. defibrination syndromed)  By precipitated cryoglobulinse)  By fat embolismf)  In decompression sickness.\\nii) Causes in the microvasculature wall :\\na)  Vasculitis e.g. in polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch-Schönlein\\npurpura, Arthus reaction, septicaemia.b)  Frost-bite injuring the wall of small blood vessels.\\niii) Outside pressure  on microvasculature :\\na)  Bedsores.\\nFACTORS DETERMINING SEVERITY OF ISCHAEMIC\\nINJURY.  The extent of damage produced by ischaemia due\\nto occlusion of arterial or venous blood vessels depends upona number of factors. These are as under:\\n1.Anatomic pattern.  The extent of injury by ischaemia\\ndepends upon the anatomic pattern of arterial blood supply\\nof the organ or tissue affected. There are 4 different patternsof arterial blood supply:\\ni\\n) Single arterial supply without anastomosis.  Some organs\\nreceive blood supply from arteries which do not have\\nsignificant anastomosis and are thus functional end-arteries.Occlusion of such vessels invariably results in ischaemicnecrosis. For example:\\nCentral artery of the retina\\nInterlobular arteries of the kidneys.\\nii) Single arterial supply with rich anastomosis.  Arterial supply\\nto some organs has rich interarterial anastomoses so thatblockage of one vessel can re-establish blood supplybypassing the blocked arterial branch, and hence theinfarction is less common in such circumstances. Forexample:\\nSuperior mesenteric artery supplying blood to the small\\nintestine.\\nInferior mesenteric artery supplying blood to distal colon.\\nArterial supply to the stomach by 3 separate vessels\\nderived from coeliac axis.Interarterial anastomoses in the 3 main trunks of the\\ncoronary arterial system.\\niii) Parallel arterial supply.  Blood supply to some organs and\\ntissues is such that the vitality of the tissue is maintained by\\nalternative blood supply in case of occlusion of one. Forexample:\\nBlood supply to the brain in the region of circle of Willis.\\nArterial supply to forearm by radial and ulnar arteries.\\niv) Double blood supply . The effect of occlusion of one set of\\nvessels is modified if an organ has dual blood supply. Forexample:\\nLungs are perfused by bronchial circulation as well as\\nby pulmonary arterial branches.\\nLiver is supplied by both portal circulation and hepatic\\narterial flow.\\nHowever, collateral circulation is of little value if the\\nvessels are severely affected with spasm, atheroma or any\\nother such condition.\\n2. General and cardiovascular status.  The general status\\nof an individual as regards cardiovascular function is an\\nimportant determinant to assess the effect of ischaemia. Some\\nof the factors which render the tissues more vulnerable tothe effects of ischaemia are as under:i) Anaemias (sickle cell anaemia, in particular)ii) Lowered oxygenation of blood (hypoxaemia)iii) Senility with marked coronary atherosclerosis\\niv) Cardiac failure\\nv) Blood lossvi) Shock.\\n3. Type of tissue affected.  The vulnerability of tissue of the\\nbody to the effect of ischaemia is variable. The mesenchymal\\ntissues are quite resistant to the effect of ischaemia ascompared to parenchymal cells of the organs. The followingtissues are more vulnerable to ischaemia:\\ni) Brain (cerebral cortical neurons, in particular).\\nii) Heart (myocardial cells).iii) Kidney (especially epithelial cells of proximal convoluted\\ntubules).\\n4. Rapidity of development.  Sudden vascular obstruction\\nresults in more severe effects of ischaemia than if it is gradual\\nsince there is less time for collaterals to develop.\\n5. Degree of vascular occlusion.  Complete vascular\\nobstruction results in more severe ischaemic injury than the\\npartial occlusion.\\nEFFECTS.  The effects of ischaemia are variable and range\\nfrom ‘no change’ to ‘sudden death’.\\n1.No effects on the tissues,  if the collateral channels\\ndevelop adequately so that the effect of ischaemia fails to\\noccur.\\n2.\\nFunctional disturbances.  These result when collateral\\nchannels are able to supply blood during normal activity but\\nthe supply is not adequate to withstand the effect of exertion.The examples are angina pectoris and intermittentclaudication.\\n3. Cellular changes.  Partial and gradual ischaemia may\\nproduce cellular changes such as cloudy swelling, fatty126SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniqueschange, ischaemic atrophy and replacement fibrosis.\\nInfarction results when the deprivation of blood supply iscomplete so as to cause necrosis of tissue affected.\\n4. Sudden death.  The cause of sudden death from ischaemia\\nis usually myocardial and cerebral infarction.\\nThe most important and common outcome of ischaemia\\nis infarction which is discussed below.\\nINFARCTION\\nDEFINITION.  Infarction is the process of tissue necrosis\\nresulting from some form of circulatory insufficiency; the\\nlocalised area of necrosis so developed is called an infarct .\\nETIOLOGY.  All the causes of ischaemia discussed above\\ncan cause infarction. There are a few other noteworthyfeatures in infarction:\\nMost commonly, infarcts are caused by interruption in\\narterial blood supply, called ischaemic necrosis .\\nLess commonly, venous obstruction can produce infarcts\\ntermed stagnant hypoxia .\\nGenerally, sudden, complete, and continuous occlusion  (e.g.\\nthrombosis or embolism) produces infarcts.\\nInfarcts may be produced by nonocclusive circulatory\\ninsufficiency  as well e.g. incomplete atherosclerotic narrowing\\nof coronary arteries may produce myocardial infarction dueto acute coronary insufficiency.\\nTYPES OF INFARCTS.  Infarcts are classified depending\\nupon different features:\\n1.According to their colour:\\nPale or anaemic,  due to arterial occlusion and are seen in\\ncompact organs e.g. in the kidneys, heart, spleen.\\nRed or haemorrhagic,  seen in soft loose tissues and are\\ncaused either by pulmonary arterial obstruction (e.g. in the\\nlungs) or by arterial or venous occlusion (e.g. in theintestines).\\n2. According to their age:\\nRecent or fresh\\nOld or healed\\n3. According to presence or absence of infection:\\nBland , when free of bacterial contamination\\nSeptic , when infected.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The process of infarction takes place as\\nfollows:\\ni)Localised hyperaemia  due to local anoxaemia occurs\\nimmediately after obstruction of the blood supply.ii)Within a few hours, the affected part becomes swollen\\ndue to oedema and haemorrhage . The amount of haemorrhage\\nis variable, being more marked in the lungs and spleen, and\\nless extensive in the kidneys and heart.\\niii)\\nCellular changes  such as cloudy swelling and degenera-\\ntion appear early, while death of the cells (i.e. necrosis) occurs\\nin 12-48 hours.\\niv)There is progressive proteolysis  of the necrotic tissue and\\nthere is lysis of the red cells.v) An acute inflammatory reaction and hyperaemia appear at\\nthe same time in the surrounding tissues in response to\\nproducts of proteolysis.\\nvi) Blood pigments , haematoidin and haemosiderin, liberated\\nby lysis of RBCs are deposited in the infarct. At this stage,\\nmost infarcts become pale-grey due to loss of red cells.\\nvii) Following this, there is progressive ingrowth of granulation\\ntissue  from the margin of the infarct so that eventually the\\ninfarct is replaced by a fibrous scar. Dystrophic calcification\\nmay occur sometimes.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Some general morpho-\\nlogical features of infarcts are common to infarcts of allorgan sites.\\nGrossly,  infarcts of solid organs are usually wedge-\\nshaped, the apex pointing towards the occluded artery\\nand the wide base on the surface of the organ. Infarctsdue to arterial occlusion are generally pale while those\\ndue to venous obstruction are haemorrhagic. Most infarcts\\nbecome pale later as the red cells are lysed but pulmonaryinfarcts never become pale due to extensive amount ofblood. Cerebral infarcts are poorly defined with central\\nsoftening (encephalomalacia). Recent infarcts are generally\\nslightly elevated over the surface while the old infarctsare shrunken and depressed under the surface of theorgan.\\nMicroscopically,  the pathognomonic cytologic change in\\nall infarcts is coagulative (ischaemic) necrosis of the\\naffected area of tissue or organ. In cerebral infarcts,however, there is characteristic liquefactive necrosis. Some\\namount of haemorrhage is generally present in any infarct.\\nAt the periphery of an infarct, inflammatory reaction isnoted. Initially, neutrophils predominate but subsequentlymacrophages and fibroblasts appear. Eventually, the\\nnecrotic area is replaced by fibrous scar tissue, which at\\ntimes may show dystrophic calcification. In cerebralinfarcts, the liquefactive necrosis is followed by gliosis i.e.replacement by microglial cells distended by fatty material\\n(gitter cells).\\nInfarcts of Different Organs\\nFig. 5.26 shows the organs most commonly affected by\\ninfarction.\\nA few representative examples of infarction of some\\norgans (lungs, kidney, liver and spleen) are discussed below.\\nMyocardial infarction (Chapter 16), cerebral infarction(Chapter 30) and infarction of the small intestines (Chapter\\n20) are covered in detail later in respective chapters of\\nSystemic Pathology.\\nINFARCT LUNG.  Embolism of the pulmonary arteries may\\nproduce pu lmonary infarction, though not always. This is\\nbecause lungs receive blood supply from bronchial arteries\\nas well, and thus occlusion of pulmonary artery ordinarilydoes not produce infarcts. However, it may occur in patients127CHAPTER 5 Derangements of Homeostasis and Haemodynamics\\nwho have inadequate circulation such as in chronic lung\\ndiseases and congestive heart failure.\\nGrossly,  pulmonary infarcts are classically wedge-shaped\\nwith base on the pleura, haemorrhagic, variable in size,and most often in the lower lobes  (Fig. 5.27) . FibrinousFigure 5.26 Common locations of systemic infarcts following arterial\\nembolism.pleuritis usually covers the area of infarct. Cut surface isdark purple and may show the blocked vessel near theapex of the infarcted area. Old organised and healedpulmonary infarcts appear as retracted fibrous scars.Microscopically,  the characteristic histologic feature is\\ncoagulative necrosis of the alveolar walls. Initially, thereis infiltration by neutrophils and intense alveolar capillarycongestion, but later their place is taken by haemosiderin,phagocytes and granulation tissue (Fig. 5.28) .\\nINFARCT KIDNEY.  Renal infarction is common, found in\\nup to 5% of autopsies. Majority of them are caused bythromboemboli, most commonly originating from the heartsuch as in mural thrombi in the left atrium, myocardialinfarction, vegetative endocarditis and from aortic aneurysm.Less commonly, renal infarcts may occur due to advancedrenal artery atherosclerosis, arteritis and sickle cell anaemia.\\nGrossly,  renal infarcts are often multiple and may be\\nbilateral. Characteristically, they are pale or anaemic andwedge-shaped with base resting under the capsule andapex pointing towards the medulla. Generally, a narrowrim of preserved renal tissue under the capsule is sparedbecause it draws its blood supply from the capsularvessels. Cut surface of renal infarct in the first 2 to 3 daysis red and congested but by 4th day the centre becomespale yellow. At the end of one week, the infarct is typicallyanaemic and depressed below the surface of the kidney(Fig. 5.29) .\\nMicroscopically,  the affected area shows characteristic\\ncoagulative necrosis of renal parenchyma i.e. there areghosts of renal tubules and glomeruli without intact nucleiand cytoplasmic content. The margin of the infarct showsinflammatory reaction—initially acute but latermacrophages and fibrous tissue predominate (Fig. 5.30) .\\nFigure 5.27 Haemorrhagic infarct lung. The sectioned surface shows\\ndark tan firm areas (arrow) with base on the pleura.Figure 5.28 Haemorrhagic infarct lung. Infarcted area shows ghost\\nalveoli filled with blood.\\n128SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nINFARCT SPLEEN.  Spleen is one of the common sites for\\ninfarction. Splenic infarction results from occlusion of the\\nsplenic artery or its branches. Occlusion is caused mostcommonly by thromboemboli arising in the heart (e.g. inmural thrombi in the left atrium, vegetative endocarditis,\\nmyocardial infarction), and less frequently by obstruction of\\nmicrocirculation (e.g. in myeloproliferative diseases, sicklecell anaemia, arteritis, Hodgkin’s disease, bacterialinfections).\\nGrossly,  splenic infarcts are often multiple. They are\\ncharacteristically pale or anaemic and wedge-shaped withtheir base at the periphery and apex pointing towardshilum (Fig. 5.31).\\nMicroscopically,  the features are similar to those found\\nin anaemic infarcts in kidney. Coagulative necrosis andinflammatory reaction are seen. Later, the necrotic tissueis replaced by shrunken fibrous scar (Fig. 5.32) .\\nINFARCT LIVER.  Just as in lungs, infarcts in the liver are\\nuncommon due to dual blood supply—from portal vein andfrom hepatic artery. Obstruction of the portal vein is usuallysecondary to other diseases such as hepatic cirrhosis,intravenous invasion of primary carcinoma of the liver,Figure 5.29 Infarct kidney. The wedge-shaped infarct is slightly\\ndepressed on the surface. The apex lies internally and wide base is on\\nthe surface. The central area is pale while the margin is haemorrhagic.Figure 5.30 Renal infarct. Renal tubules and glomeruli show typical\\ncoagulative necrosis i.e. intact outlines of necrosed cells. There is acuteinflammatory infiltrate at the periphery of the infarct.\\nFigure 5.31\\nPale infarct spleen. A wedge-shaped shrunken area of\\npale colour is seen with base resting under the capsule, while the marginis congested.\\nFigure 5.32 Pale infarct spleen.

Occlusion of\\nportal vein or its branches generally does not produceischaemic infarction but instead reduced blood supply tohepatic parenchyma causes non-ischaemic infarct calledinfarct of Zahn . Obstruction of the hepatic artery or its\\nbranches, on the other hand, caused by arteritis,arteriosclerosis, bland or septic emboli, results in ischaemicinfarcts of the liver.\\nGrossly,  ischaemic infarcts of the liver are usually anaemic\\nbut sometimes may be haemorrhagic due to stuffing ofthe site by blood from the portal vein. Infarcts of Zahn(non-ischaemic infarcts) produce sharply defined red-bluearea in liver parenchyma.Microscopically,  ischaemic infarcts show characteristics\\nof pale or anaemic infarcts as in kidney or spleen. Infarctsof Zahn occurring due to reduced portal blood flow overa long duration result in chronic atrophy of hepatocytesand dilatation of sinusoids.\\nTable 5.9 summarises the gross appearance and the usual\\noutcome of the common types of infarction.\\n❑130SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nChapter 6Chapter 6\\nINFLAMMATION\\nINTRODUCTION\\nDEFINITION AND CAUSES.  Inflammation is defined as\\nthe local response of living mammalian tissues to injury due\\nto any agent. It is a body defense reaction in order to eliminateor limit the spread of injurious agent, followed by removalof the necrosed cells and tissues.\\nThe agents causing inflammation may be as under:\\n1.Infective agents  like bacteria, viruses and their toxins,\\nfungi, parasites.\\n2.Immunological agents  like cell-mediated and antigen-\\nantibody reactions.\\n3.Physical agents  like heat, cold, radiation, mechanical\\ntrauma.\\n4.Chemical agents  like organic and inorganic poisons.\\n5.Inert materials such as foreign bodies.\\nThus, inflammation is distinct from infection —while\\ninflammation is a protective response by the body to varietyof etiologic agents (infectious or non-infectious), whileinfection is invasion into the body by harmful microbes andtheir resultant ill-effects by toxins. Inflammation involves 2basic processes with some overlapping, viz. early inflam-\\nmatory response  and later followed by healing . Though both\\nthese processes generally have protective role againstinjurious agents, inflammation and healing may causeconsiderable harm to the body as well e.g. anaphylaxis tobites by insects or reptiles, drugs, toxins, atherosclerosis,chronic rheumatoid arthritis, fibrous bands and adhesionsin intestinal obstruction.\\nAs discussed earlier (Chapter 4), “immunity or immune\\nreaction” and “inflammatory response” by the host are bothprotective mechanisms in the body—inflammation is thevisible response to an immune reaction, and activation ofimmune response is almost essential before inflammatoryresponse appears.\\nSIGNS OF INFLAMMATION.  The Roman writer Celsus\\nin 1st century A.D. named the famous 4 cardinal signs of\\ninflammation  as:\\nrubor  (redness);\\ntumor  (swelling);\\ncalor  (heat); and\\ndolor  (pain).\\nTo these, fifth sign functio laesa  (loss of function) was\\nlater added by Virchow. The word inflammation means\\nburning. This nomenclature had its origin in old times butnow we know that burning is only one of the signs ofinflammation.TYPES OF INFLAMMATION.  Depending upon the defense\\ncapacity of the host and duration of response, inflammationcan be classified as acute and chronic.\\nA.Acute inflammation  is of short duration (lasting less than\\n2 weeks) and represents the early body reaction, resolves\\nquickly and is usually followed by healing.\\nThe main features of acute inflammation are:\\n1.accumulation of fluid and plasma at the affected site;\\n2.intravascular activation of platelets; and\\n3.\\npolymorphonuclear neutrophils as inflammatory cells.\\nSometimes, the acute inflammatory response may be\\nquite severe and is termed as fulminant acute inflammation.\\nB.Chronic inflammation  is of longer duration and occurs\\neither after the causative agent of acute inflammation persistsfor a long time, or the stimulus is such that it induces chronicinflammation from the beginning. A variant, chronic active\\ninflammation , is the type of chronic inflammation in which\\nduring the course of disease there are acute exacerbations ofactivity.\\nThe characteristic feature of chronic inflammation is\\npresence of chronic inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes,plasma cells and macrophages, granulation tissue formation,and in specific situations as granulomatous inflammation.\\nIn some instances, the term subacute inflammation  is used\\nfor the state of inflammation between acute and chronic.\\nACUTE INFLAMMATION\\nAcute inflammatory response by the host to any agent is a\\ncontinuous process but for the purpose of discussion, it canbe divided into following two events:I.Vascular events.\\nII.\\nCellular events.\\nIntimately linked to these two processes is the release of\\nmediators of acute inflammation, discussed just thereafter.\\nI. VASCULAR EVENTS\\nAlteration in the microvasculature (arterioles, capillaries and\\nvenules) is the earliest response to tissue injury. Thesealterations include: haemodynamic changes and changes invascular permeability.\\nHaemodynamic Changes\\nThe earliest features of inflammatory response result from\\nchanges in the vascular flow and calibre of small bloodvessels in the injured tissue. The sequence of these changesis as under:\\n1. Irrespective of the type of injury, immediate vascular res-\\nponse is of transient vasoconstriction  of arterioles. With mildInflammation and Healing131CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healingform of injury, the blood flow may be re-established in 3-5\\nseconds while with more severe injury the vasoconstrictionmay last for about 5 minutes.\\n2. Next follows persistent progressive vasodilatation  which\\ninvolves mainly the arterioles, but to a lesser extent, affects\\nother components of the microcirculation like venules andcapillaries. This change is obvious within half an hour ofinjury. Vasodilatation results in increased blood volume inmicrovascular bed of the area, which is responsible forredness and warmth at the site of acute inflammation.\\n3. Progressive vasodilatation, in turn, may elevate the local\\nhydrostatic pressure  resulting in transudation of fluid into\\nthe extracellular space. This is responsible for swelling at\\nthe local site of acute inflammation.\\n4.Slowing or stasis  of microcirculation follows which\\ncauses increased concentration of red cells, and thus, raised\\nblood viscosity.\\n5. Stasis or slowing is followed by leucocytic margination\\nor peripheral orientation of leucocytes (mainly neutrophils)\\nalong the vascular endothelium. The leucocytes stick to thevascular endothelium briefly, and then move and migratethrough the gaps between the endothelial cells into theextravascular space. This process is known as emigration\\n(discussed later in detail).\\nThe features of haemodynamic changes in inflammation\\nare best demonstrated by the Lewis experiment.  Lewis\\ninduced the changes in the skin of inner aspect of forearmby firm stroking with a blunt point. The reaction so elicitedis known as triple response  or red line response  consisting of\\nthe following (Fig. 6.1):\\ni) Red line appears within a few seconds following stroking\\nand is due to local vasodilatation of capillaries andvenules.\\nii) Flare  is the bright reddish appearance or flush surroun-\\nding the red line and results from vasodilatation of theadjacent arterioles.\\niii)\\nWheal  is the swelling or oedema of the surrounding skin\\noccurring due to transudation of fluid into the extra-vascular space.These features, thus, elicit the classical signs of inflam-\\nmation—redness, heat, swelling and pain.\\nAltered  Vascular Permeability\\nPATHOGENESIS.  In and around the inflamed tissue, there\\nis accumulation of oedema fluid in the interstitial compart-\\nment which comes from blood plasma by its escape throughthe endothelial wall of peripheral vascular bed. In the initialstage, the escape of fluid is due to vasodilatation andconsequent elevation in hydrostatic pressure. This istransudate in nature. But subsequently, the characteristicinflammatory oedema, exudate, appears by increasedvascular permeability of microcirculation. The differencesbetween transudate and exudate, are already summarisedin Table 4.1 (see page 96).\\nThe appearance of inflammatory oedema due to increased\\nvascular permeability of microvascular bed is explained onthe basis of Starling’s hypothesis . In normal circumstances,\\nthe fluid balance is maintained by two opposing sets of forces:\\ni) Forces that cause outward movement  of fluid from\\nmicrocirculation are intravascular hydrostatic pressure  and\\ncolloid osmotic pressure of interstitial fluid .\\nii\\n) Forces that cause inward movement  of interstitial fluid\\ninto circulation are intravascular colloid osmotic pressure  and\\nhydrostatic pressure of interstitial fluid .\\nWhatever little fluid is left in the interstitial compartment\\nis drained away by lymphatics and, thus, no oedema results\\nnormally (Fig. 6.2,A).  However, in inflamed tissues, the\\nendothelial lining of microvasculature becomes more leaky.Consequently, intravascular colloid osmotic pressuredecreases and osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluidincreases resulting in excessive outward flow of fluid intothe interstitial compartment which is exudative inflammatoryoedema (Fig. 6.2,B).\\nMECHANISMS OF INCREASED VASCULAR PERME-ABILITY.  In acute inflammation, normally non-permeable\\nendothelial layer of microvasculature becomes leaky. This isexplained by one or more of the following mechanisms whichare diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 6.3.\\nFigure 6.1 A, ‘Triple response’ elicited by firm stroking of skin of forearm with a pencil. B, Diagrammatic view of microscopic features o f triple\\nresponse of the skin.\\n132SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesi) Contraction of endothelial cells . This is the most\\ncommon mechanism of increased leakiness that affects\\nvenules exclusively while capillaries and arterioles remainunaffected. The endothelial cells develop temporary gapsbetween them due to their contraction resulting in vascularleakiness. It is mediated by the release of histamine,bradykinin and other chemical mediators. The responsebegins immediately after injury, is usually reversible, and isfor short duration (15-30 minutes).\\nExample of such immediate transient leakage  is mild thermal\\ninjury of skin of forearm.\\nii) Retraction of endothelial  cells.  In this mechanism, there\\nis structural re-organisation of the cytoskeleton of endothelial\\ncells that causes reversible retraction at the intercellularjunctions. This change too affects venules and is mediatedby cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosisfactor (TNF)- α. The onset of response takes 4-6 hours after\\ninjury and lasts for 2-4 hours or more (somewhat delayed and\\nprolonged leakage) .\\nThe example of this type of response exists in vitro\\nexperimental work only.\\niii)Direct injury to endothelial cells.  Direct injury to the\\nendothelium causes cell necrosis and appearance of physical\\ngaps at the sites of detached endothelial cells. Process ofthrombosis is initiated at the site of damaged endothelialcells. The change affects all levels of microvasculature(venules, capillaries and arterioles). The increasedpermeability may either appear immediately after injury andlast for several hours or days (immediate sustained leakage) , or\\nmay occur after a delay of 2-12 hours and last for hours ordays (delayed prolonged leakage).\\nThe examples of immediate sustained leakage are severe\\nbacterial infections while delayed prolonged leakage mayoccur following moderate thermal injury and radiationinjury.\\niv) Endothelial injury mediated by leucocytes.  Adherence\\nof leucocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation\\nmay result in activation of leucocytes. The activated\\nFigure 6.2 Fluid interchange between blood and extracellular fluid\\n(ECF). (HP = hydrostatic pressure, OP = osmotic pressure).\\nFigure 6.3 Schematic illustration of pathogenesis of increased vascular permeability in acute inflammation. The serial numbers in the figu re\\ncorrespond to five numbers in the text.\\n133CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\nleucocytes release proteolytic enzymes and toxic oxygen\\nspecies which may cause endothelial injury and increasedvascular leakiness. This form of increased vascular leakinessaffects mostly venules and is a late response .\\nThe examples are seen in sites where leucocytes adhere\\nto the vascular endothelium e.g. in pulmonary venules andcapillaries.\\nv) Leakiness in neovascularisation.  In addition, the newly\\nformed capillaries under the influence of vascular endothelial\\ngrowth factor (VEGF) during the process of repair and intumours are excessively leaky.\\nThese mechanisms are summarised in Table 6.1.\\nII. CELLULAR EVENTS\\nThe cellular phase of inflammation consists of 2 processes:1.exudation of leucocytes; and\\n2.\\nphagocytosis.Exudation of Leucocytes\\nThe escape of leucocytes from the lumen of microvasculature\\nto the interstitial tissue is the most important feature ofinflammatory response. In acute inflammation, polymorpho-nuclear neutrophils (PMNs) comprise the first line of bodydefense, followed later by monocytes and macrophages.\\nThe changes leading to migration of leucocytes are as\\nfollows (Fig. 6.4) :\\n1. CHANGES IN THE FORMED ELEMENTS OF BLOOD.\\nIn the early stage of inflammation, the rate of flow of bloodis increased due to vasodilatation. But subsequently, thereis slowing or stasis of bloodstream. With stasis, changes inthe normal axial flow of blood in the microcirculation takeplace. The normal axial flow consists of central stream ofcells comprised by leucocytes and RBCs and peripheral cell-free layer of plasma close to vessel wall. Due to slowing and\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 6.1: Mechanisms of Increased Vascular Permeability.\\nMechanism Microvasculature Response Type Pathogenesis Examples\\n1.

D, Emigration of neutrophils and diapedesis with damaged basement membrane.\\n134SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesstasis, the central stream of cells widens and peripheral\\nplasma zone becomes narrower because of loss of plasmaby exudation. This phenomenon is known as margination .\\nAs a result of this redistribution, the neutrophils of the centralcolumn come close to the vessel wall; this is known aspavementing .\\n2. ROLLING AND ADHESION.  Peripherally marginated\\nand pavemented neutrophils slowly roll over the endothelialcells lining the vessel wall (rolling phase) .  This is followed by\\nthe transient bond between the leucocytes and endothelialcells becoming firmer (adhesion phase). The following\\nmolecules bring about rolling and adhesion phases:\\ni)Selectins are expressed on the surface of activated\\nendothelial cells which recognise specific carbohydrate\\ngroups found on the surface of neutrophils, the most\\nimportant of which is s-Lewis X molecule. While P-selectin\\n(preformed and stored  in endothelial cells and platelets) is\\ninvolved in rolling, E-selectin  (synthesised by cytokine-\\nactivated endothelial cells) is associated with both rolling and\\nadhesion; L-selectin (expressed on the surface of lymphocytes\\nand neutrophils) is responsible for homing of circulatinglymphocytes to the endothelial cells in lymph nodes.\\nii)Integrins on the endothelial cell surface are activated\\nduring the process of loose and transient adhesions between\\nendothelial cells and leucocytes. At the same time thereceptors for integrins on the neutrophils are also stimulated.This process brings about firm adhesion between leucocyteand endothelium.\\niii)Immunoglobulin gene superfamily adhesion molecule\\nsuch as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and\\nvascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) allow a tighteradhesion and stabilise the interaction between leucocytes and\\nendothelial cells. Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-\\n1 (PECAM-1) or CD31 may also be involved in leucocytemigration from the endothelial surface.\\n3. EMIGRATION.  After sticking of neutrophils to endo-\\nthelium, the former move along the endothelial surface till a\\nsuitable site between the endothelial cells is found wherethe neutrophils throw out cytoplasmic pseudopods.Subsequently, the neutrophils lodged between the\\nendothelial cells and basement membrane cross the basement\\nmembrane by damaging it locally with secreted collagenasesand escape out into the extravascular space; this is known asemigration . The damaged basement membrane is repaired\\nalmost immediately. As already mentioned, neutrophils arethe dominant cells in acute inflammatory exudate in the first\\n24 hours, and monocyte-macrophages appear in the next\\n24-48 hours. However, neutrophils are short-lived (24-48hours) while monocyte-macrophages survive much longer.\\nSimultaneous to emigration of leucocytes, escape of red\\ncells through gaps between the endothelial cells, diapedesis ,\\ntakes place. It is a passive phenomenon—RBCs being forced\\nout either by raised hydrostatic pressure or may escape\\nthrough the endothelial defects left after emigration of\\nleucocytes. Diapedesis gives haemorrhagic appearance to theinflammatory exudate.4. CHEMOTAXIS.  The chemotactic factor-mediated\\ntransmigration of leucocytes after crossing several barriers(endothelium, basement membrane, perivascular myofibro-blasts and matrix) to reach the interstitial tissues is calledchemotaxis. The concept of chemotaxis is well illustrated byBoyden’s chamber experiment . In this, a millipore filter (3 μm\\npore size) separates the suspension of leucocytes from thetest solution in tissue culture chamber. If the test solutioncontains chemotactic agent, the leucocytes migrate throughthe pores of filter towards the chemotactic agent (Fig. 6.5) .\\nThe following agents act as potent chemotactic substances\\nor chemokines  for neutophils:\\ni) Leukotriene B\\n4 (LT-B4), a product of lipooxygenase\\npathway of arachidonic acid metabolites\\nii) Components of complement system (C5a and C3a in\\nparticular)\\niii) Cytokines (Interleukins, in particular IL-8)\\niv) Soluble bacterial products (such as formylated peptides).\\nIn addition to neutrophils, other inflammatory cells too\\nrespond and partake in inflammation and there are\\nchemokines for them, e.g. monocyte chemoattractant protein(MCP-1), eotaxin chemotactic for eosinophils, NK cells forrecognising virally infected cells etc.\\nPhagocytosis\\nPhagocytosis is defined as the process of engulfment of solid\\nparticulate material by the cells (cell-eating). The cellsperforming this function are called phagocytes . There are 2\\nmain types of phagocytic cells:\\ni)Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) which appear\\nearly in acute inflammatory response, sometimes called as\\nmicrophages .\\nii)Circulating monocytes and fixed tissue mononuclear\\nphagocytes, commonly called as macrophages .\\nNeutrophils and macrophages on reaching the tissue\\nspaces produce several proteolyitc enzymes—lysozyme,protease, collagenase, elastase, lipase, proteinase, gelatinase,and acid hydrolases. These enzymes degrade collagen andextracellular matrix. The microbe undergoes the process ofphagocytosis  by polymorphs and macrophages and involvesthe following 3 steps (Fig. 6.6) :Figure 6.5 The Boyden’s chamber with millipore filter, shown by\\ndotted line. A, Suspension of leucocytes above is separated from test\\nsolution below. B, Lower half of chamber shows migration of neutrophilstowards chemotactic agent.\\n135CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\n1. Recognition and attachment\\n2. Engulfment3. Killing and degradation\\n1. RECOGNITION AND ATTACHMENT\\nPhagocytosis is initiated by the expression of surfacereceptors on macrophages which recognise microorganisms:mannose receptor  and scavenger receptor . The process of\\nphagocytosis is further enhanced when the microorganismsare coated with specific proteins, opsonins , from the serum\\nor they get opsonised. Opsonins establish a bond betweenbacteria and the cell membrane of phagocytic cell. The mainopsonins present in the serum and their correspondingreceptors on the surface of phagocytic cells (PMNs ormacrophages) are as under:\\ni) IgG opsonin  is the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G; it is\\nthe naturally occurring antibody in the serum that coats the\\nbacteria while the PMNs possess receptors for the same.\\nii) C3b opsonin  is the fragment generated by activation of\\ncomplement pathway. It is strongly chemotactic for attracting\\nPMNs to bacteria.\\niii) Lectins  are carbohydrate-binding proteins in the plasma\\nwhich bind to bacterial cell wall.\\n2. ENGULFMENT\\nThe opsonised particle bound to the surface of phagocyte isready to be engulfed. This is accomplished by formation ofcytoplasmic pseudopods around the particle due toactivation of actin filaments beneath cell wall, enveloping itin a phagocytic vacuole. Eventually, the plasma membraneenclosing the particle breaks from the cell surface so thatmembrane lined phagocytic vacuole or phagosome liesinternalised and free in the cell cytoplasm. The phagosomefuses with one or more lysosomes of the cell and form biggervacuole called phagolysosome.\\n3. KILLING AND DEGRADATION\\nNext comes the stage of killing and degradation of micro-organism to dispose it off justifying the function ofphagocytes as scavanger cells. The microorganisms afterbeing killed by antibacterial substances are degraded byhydrolytic enzymes. However, this mechanism fails to killand degrade some bacteria like tubercle bacilli.Disposal of microorganisms can proceed by following\\nmechanisms:A.Intracellular mechanisms:\\ni) Oxidative bactericidal mechanism by oxygen free radicals\\na)MPO-dependent\\nb\\n) MPO-independent\\nii) Oxidative bactericidal mechanism by lysosomal granules\\niii) Non-oxidative bactericidal mechanism\\nB.Extracellular mechanisms:These mechanisms are discussed below.\\nA. INTRACELLULAR MECHANISMS.  There are\\nintracellular metabolic pathways which more commonly kill\\nmicrobes by oxidative mechanism and less often non-\\noxidative pathways.\\ni) Oxidative bactericidal mechanism by oxygen free\\nradicals.  An important mechanism of microbicidal killing is\\nby oxidative damage by the production of reactive oxygen\\nmetabolites (O’\\n2 H2O2, OH’, HOCl, HOI, HOBr).\\nA phase of increased oxygen consumption (‘respiratory\\nburst’) by activated phagocytic leucocytes requires theessential presence of NADPH oxidase.\\nNADPH-oxidase present in the cell membrane of\\nphagosome reduces oxygen to superoxide ion (O’\\n2):\\n2O2 2O’2\\nNADPH (Superoxide\\noxidase anion)\\n NADPH                      NADP + H+\\nSuperoxide is subsequently converted into H2O2 which\\nhas bactericidal properties:\\n2O’2 + 2H+H2O2\\n(Hydrogen peroxide)\\nThis type of bactericidal activity is carried out either via\\nenzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) present in the azurophilicgranules of neutrophils and monocytes, or independent ofenzyme MPO, as under:\\na)MPO-dependent killing.  In this mechanism, the enzyme\\nMPO acts on H\\n2O2 in the presence of halides (chloride, iodideFigure 6.6 Stages in phagocytosis of a foreign particle. A, Opsonisation of the particle.

D, Phagolysosome formation after fusion of lysosome of  the cell.\\n136SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesor bromide) to form hypohalous acid (HOCl, HOI, HOBr).\\nThis is called H2O2-MPO-halide system  and is more potent\\nantibacterial system in polymorphs than H2O2 alone:\\nMPO\\nH2O2HOCl + H2O\\nCl’, Br’, I’ (Hypochlorous acid)\\nb)MPO-independent killing.  Mature macrophages lack the\\nenzyme MPO and they carry out bactericidal activity byproducing OH\\n– ions and superoxide singlet oxygen (O’) from\\nH2O2 in the presence of O’2 (Haber-Weiss reaction) or in the\\npresence of Fe++ (Fenton reaction):\\nReactive oxygen metabolites are particularly useful in\\neliminating microbial organisms that grow withinphagocytes e.g. M. tuberculosis, Histoplasma capsulatum.\\nii) Oxidative bactericidal mechanism by lysosomalgranules.  In this mechanism, the preformed granule-stored\\nproducts of neutrophils and macrophages are discharged orsecreted into the phagosome and the extracellularenvironment. While the role of MPO is already highlightedabove, others liberated by degranulation of macrophages andneutrophils are protease, trypsinase, phospholipase, andalkaline phosphatase. Progressive degranulation ofneutrophils and macrophages along with oxygen free radicalsdegrades proteins i.e. induces proteolysis.\\niii)Non-oxidative bactericidal mechanism.  Some agents\\nreleased from the granules of phagocytic cells do not require\\noxygen for bactericidal activity. These include the following:\\na) Granules.  Some of liberated lysosomal granules do not kill\\nby oxidative damage but cause lysis of within phagosome.\\nThese are lysosomal hydrolases, permeability increasingfactors, cationic proteins (defensins), lipases, ptoteases,DNAases.\\nb) Nitric oxide.  Nitric oxide reactive free radicals similar to\\noxygen free radicals are formed by nitric oxide synthase and\\nis a potent mechanism of microbial killing. Nitric oxide isproduced by endothelial cells as well as by activatedmacrophages.\\nB. EXTRACELLULAR MECHANISMS. Following\\nmechanisms explain the bactericidal activity at extracellular\\nlevel:\\ni) Granules.  Degranulation of macrophages and neutrophils\\nexplained above continues to exert its effects of proteolysis\\noutside the cells as well.\\nii) Immune mechanisms.  As already discussed in Chapter\\n4, immune-mediated lysis of microbes takes place outside\\nthe cells by mechanisms of cytolysis, antibody-mediated lysisand by cell-mediated cytotoxicity.CHEMICAL MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION\\nAlso called as permeability factors or endogenous mediators\\nof increased vascular permeability, these are a large andincreasing number of endogenous compounds which canenhance vascular permeability. However, currently manychemical mediators have been identified which partake inother processes of acute inflammation as well e.g.vasodilatation, chemotaxis, fever, pain and cause tissuedamage.\\nThe substances acting as chemical mediators of\\ninflammation may be released from the cells, the plasma, or\\ndamaged tissue  itself. They are broadly classified into 2 groups:\\ni)mediators released by cells; and\\nii)mediators originating from plasma.Table 6.2  presents a list of chemical mediators of acute\\ninflammation.\\nChemical mediators derived from various sources and\\ntheir contribution in acute inflammation are shown inFig. 6.7 .\\nI.\\nCell-derived Mediators\\n1. VASOACTIVE AMINES.  Two important pharmaco-\\nlogically active amines that have role in the earlyinflammatory response (first one hour) are histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin; another recentlyadded group is of neuropeptides.\\ni) Histamine.  It is stored in the granules of mast cells,\\nbasophils and platelets. Histamine is released from these cells\\nby various agents as under:\\na)Stimuli or substances inducing acute inflammation e.g.\\nheat, cold, irradiation, trauma, irritant chemicals,\\nimmunologic reactions etc.\\nb\\n) Anaphylatoxins like fragments of complement C3a, and\\nC5a, which increase vascular permeability and causeoedema in tissues.\\nc) Histamine-releasing factors from neutrophils, monocytes\\nand platelets.\\nd) Interleukins.O’\\n2 OH’\\nH2O2\\nOH’\\n(Hydroxyl radical)Haber-Weiss reactionFe++\\nFenton reaction\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 6.2: Chemical Mediators of Acute Inflammation.\\nI.

The complement system137CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\nThe main actions of histamine are: vasodilatation,\\nincreased vascular (venular) permeability, itching and pain.\\nStimulation of mast cells and basophils also releases productsof arachidonic acid metabolism including the release of slow-\\nreacting substances of anaphylaxis (SRS-As) . The SRS-As consist\\nof various leukotrienes (LTC\\n4, LTD4 and LTE4).\\nii) 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin).  It is present\\nin tissues like chromaffin cells of GIT, spleen, nervous tissue,mast cells and platelets. The actions of 5-HT are similar tohistamine but it is a less potent mediator of increased vascularpermeability and vasodilatation than histamine. It may bementioned here that carcinoid tumour is a serotonin-secretingtumour (Chapter 20).\\niii) Neuropeptides.  Another class of vasoactive amines is\\ntachykinin neuropeptides, such as substance P, neurokinin\\nA, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and somatostatin.These small peptides are produced in the central andperipheral nervous systems.\\nThe major proinflammatory actions  of these neuropeptides\\nis as follows:a) Increased vascular permeability.b) Transmission of pain stimuli.c) Mast cell degranulation.\\n2. ARACHIDONIC ACID METABOLITES (EICO-\\nSANOIDS).  Arachidonic acid metabolites or eicosanoids are\\nthe most potent mediators of inflammation, much more thanoxygen free radicals.\\nArachidonic acid is a fatty acid, eicosatetraenoic acid;\\nGreek word ‘ eikosa ’ means ‘twenty’ because of 20 carbon atom\\ncomposition of this fatty acid.  Arachidonic acid is aconstituent of the phospholipid cell membrane, besides itspresence in some constituents of diet. Arachidonic acid isreleased from the cell membrane by phospholipases. It is thenactivated to form arachidonic acid metabolites or eicosanoidsby one of the following 2 pathways: via cyclo-oxygenasepathway and via lipo-oxygenase pathway:i) Metabolites via cyclo-oxygenase pathway: Prostaglan-\\ndins, thromboxane A\\n2, prostacyclin.  The name ‘prosta-\\nglandin’ was first given to a substance found in humanseminal fluid but now the same substance has been isolatedfrom a number of other body cells. Prostaglandins and relatedcompounds are also called autocoids because these substances\\nare mainly auto- and paracrine agents. The terminology usedfor prostaglandins is abbreviation as PG followed by suffixof an alphabet and a serial number e.g. PGG\\n2, PGE2 etc.\\nCyclo-oxygenase (COX), a fatty acid enzyme present as\\nCOX-1 and COX-2, acts on activated arachidonic acid to formprostaglandin endoperoxide (PGG\\n2). PGG2 is enzymatically\\ntransformed into PGH2 with generation of free radical of\\noxygen. PGH2 is further acted upon by enzymes and results\\nin formation of the following 3 metabolites (Fig. 6.8):\\na)Prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2-α). PGD2 and PGE2\\nact on blood vessels to cause increased venular permeability,vasodilatation and bronchodilatation and inhibitinflammatory cell function. PGF\\n2-α induces vasodilatation\\nand bronchoconstriction.\\nb)Thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Platelets contain the enzyme\\nthromboxane synthetase and hence the metabolite,\\nthromboxane  A2, formed is active in platelet aggregation,\\nbesides its role as a vasoconstrictor and broncho-constrictor.c)Prostacyclin (PGI\\n2). PGI2 induces vasodilatation, broncho-\\ndilatation and inhibits platelet aggregation.d) Resolvins  are a newly described derivative of COX\\npathway. These mediators act by inhibiting production of\\npro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, resolvins are actually\\nhelpful—drugs such as aspirin act by inhibiting COX activity\\nand stimulating production of resolvins.\\nIt may be mentioned here that some of the major anti-\\ninflammatory drugs act by inhibiting activity of the enzyme\\nCOX; e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),COX-2 inhibitors.\\nii) Metabolites via lipo-oxygenase pathway: 5-HETE,\\nleukotrienes, lipoxins.  The enzyme, lipo-oxygenase, aFigure 6.7 Chemical mediators of inflammation.\\n138SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\npredominant enzyme in neutrophils, acts on activated\\narachidonic acid to form hydroperoxy eicosatetraenoic acid(5-HPETE) which on further peroxidation forms following 2metabolites (Fig. 6.9):\\na)5-HETE  (hydroxy compound), an intermediate product,\\nis a potent chemotactic agent for neutrophils.b)Leukotrienes  (LT) are so named as they were first isolated\\nfrom leucocytes. Firstly, unstable leukotriene A\\n4 (LTA4) is\\nformed which is acted upon by enzymes to form LTB4\\n(chemotactic for phagocytic cells and stimulates phagocyticcell adherence) while LTC\\n4, LTD4 and LTE4 have common\\nactions by causing smooth muscle contraction and therebyinduce vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction and increasedvascular permeability; hence they are also called as slow-reacting substances of anaphylaxis (SRS-As).c)Lipoxins  (LX) are a recently described product of\\nlipooxygenase pathway. Lipooxygenase-12 present inplatelets acts on LTA\\n4 derived from neutrophils and forms\\nLXA4 and LXB4. Lipoxins act to regulate and counterbalance\\nactions of leukotrienes.\\n3. LYSOSOMAL COMPONENTS.  The inflammatory\\ncells—neutrophils and monocytes, contain lysosomal\\ngranules which on release elaborate a variety of mediatorsof inflammation. These are as under:i) Granules of neutrophils.  Neutrophils have 3 types of\\ngranules: primary or azurophil, secondary or specific, andtertiary.a)Primary or azurophil granules  are large azurophil granules\\nwhich contain functionally active enzymes. These aremyeloperoxidase, acid hydrolases, acid phosphatase,lysozyme, defensin (cationic protein), phospholipase,cathepsin G, elastase, and protease.b\\n) Secondary or specific granules  contain alkaline phosphatase,\\nlactoferrin, gelatinase, collagenase, lysozyme, vitamin-B12\\nbinding proteins, plasminogen activator.c) Tertiary granules or C particles contain gelatinase and acidhydrolases.\\nMyeloperoxidase causes oxidative lysis by generation of\\noxygen free radicals, acid hydrolases act within the cell tocause destruction of bacteria in phagolysosome while prote-ases attack on the extracellular constituents such as basementmembrane, collagen, elastin, cartilage etc.\\nHowever, degradation of extracellular components like\\ncollagen, basement membrane, fibrin and cartilage byproteases results in harmful tissue destruction which is keptin check by presence of antiproteases like α\\n1-antitrypsin and\\nα2-macroglobulin.\\nii) Granules of monocytes and tissue macrophages.  These\\ncells on degranulation also release mediators of inflammationlike acid proteases, collagenase, elastase and plasminogenactivator. However, they are more active in chronicinflammation than acting as mediators of acute inflammation.\\n4. PLATELET ACTIVATING FACTOR (PAF).  It is\\nreleased from IgE-sensitised basophils or mast cells, other\\nleucocytes, endothelium and platelets. Apart from its actionon platelet aggregation and release reaction, the actions ofPAF as mediator of inflammation are:\\nincreased vascular permeability;\\nvasodilatation in low concentration and vasoconstriction\\notherwise;\\nbronchoconstriction;\\nadhesion of leucocytes to endothelium; and\\nchemotaxis.\\n5. CYTOKINES.  Cytokines are polypeptide substances pro-\\nduced by activated lymphocytes (lymphokines)  and activated\\nmonocytes (monokines).  These agents may act on ‘self’ cellsFigure 6.8 Arachidonic acid metabolites via cyclooxygenase pathway.\\nFigure 6.9 Arachidonic acid metabolites via lipooxygenase pathway.\\n139CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healingproducing them or on other cells. Although over 200\\ncytokines have been described, major cytokines acting asmediators of inflammation are: interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumournecrosis factor (TNF)- α and β, interferon (IFN)- γ, and\\nchemokines (IL-8, PF-4).\\nIL-1 and TNF- α are formed by activated macrophages\\nwhile TNF- β and IFN- γ are produced by activated T cells.\\nThe chemokines include interleukin 8 (released fromactivated macrophages) and platelet factor-4 from activatedplatelets, both of which are potent chemoattractant forinflammatory cells and hence their name.\\nThe actions of various cytokines as mediator of\\ninflammation are as under:\\ni) IL-1 and TNF- α αα αα, TNF- β ββ ββ induce endothelial effects in the\\nform of increased leucocyte adherence, thrombogenicity,\\nelaboration of other cytokines, fibroblastic proliferation andacute phase reactions.\\nii) IFN- γ γγ γγ causes activation of macrophages and neutrophils\\nand is associated with synthesis of nitric acid synthase.\\niii)Chemokines  are a family of chemoattractants for\\ninflammatory cells (as discussed above) and include:\\nIL-8 chemotactic for neutrophils;\\nplatelet factor-4 chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes\\nand eosinophils;\\nMCP-1 chemotactic for monocytes; and\\neotaxin chemotactic for eosinophils.\\n6. FREE RADICALS: OXYGEN METABOLITES AND\\nNITRIC OXIDE.  Free radicals act as potent mediator of\\ninflammation:i) Oxygen-derived metabolites are released from activated\\nneutrophils and macrophages and include superoxideoxygen (O’\\n2), H2O2, OH’ and toxic NO products. These\\noxygen-derived free radicals have the following action ininflammation:\\nEndothelial cell damage and thereby increased vascular\\npermeability.\\nActivation of protease and inactivation of antiprotease\\ncausing tissue matrix damage.\\nDamage to other cells.The actions of free radicals are counteracted by\\nantioxidants present in tissues and serum which play aprotective role (page 33).\\nii) Nitric oxide (NO)  was originally described as vascular\\nrelaxation factor produced by endothelial cells. Now it is\\nknown that NO is formed by activated macrophages duringthe oxidation of arginine by the action of enzyme, NOsynthase. NO plays the following role in mediatinginflammation:\\nVasodilatation\\nAnti-platelet activating agent\\nPossibly microbicidal action.\\nII. Plasma-derived Mediators (Plasma Proteases)\\nThese include the various products derived from activation\\nand interaction of 4 interlinked systems: kinin, clotting,fibrinolytic and complement. Each of these systems has itsinhibitors and accelerators in plasma with negative andpositive feedback mechanisms respectively.Hageman factor (factor XII) of clotting system plays a key role\\nin interactions of the four systems.  Activation of factor XII in\\nvivo by contact with basement membrane and bacterial\\nendotoxins, and in vitro  with glass or kaolin, leads to\\nactivation of clotting, fibrinolytic and kinin systems. Ininflammation, activation of factor XII is brought about bycontact of the factor leaking through the endothelial gaps.The end-products of the activated clotting, fibrinolytic andkinin systems activate the complement system that generatepermeability factors. These permeability factors, in turn,further activate clotting system.\\nThe inter-relationship among 4 systems is summarised\\nin Fig. 6.10.\\n1.THE KININ SYSTEM.  This system on activation by\\nfactor Xlla generates bradykinin, so named because of theslow contraction of smooth muscle induced by it. First,kallikrein is formed from plasma prekallikrein by the actionof prekallikrein activator which is a fragment of factor Xlla.Kallikrein then acts on high molecular weight kininogen toform bradykinin (Fig. 6.11).\\nBradykinin acts in the early stage of inflammation and\\nits effects include:\\nsmooth muscle contraction;\\nvasodilatation;\\nincreased vascular permeability; and\\npain.\\n2. THE CLOTTING SYSTEM.  Factor Xlla initiates the\\ncascade of the clotting system resulting in formation offibrinogen which is acted upon by thrombin to form fibrinand fibrinopeptides (Fig. 6.12).\\nThe actions of fibrinopeptides in inflammation are:\\nincreased vascular permeability;\\nchemotaxis for leucocyte; and\\nanticoagulant activity.\\n3. THE FIBRINOLYTIC SYSTEM.  This system is activated\\nby plasminogen activator, the sources of which includekallikrein of the kinin system, endothelial cells andleucocytes. Plasminogen activator acts on plasminogenpresent as component of plasma proteins to form plasmin.Further breakdown of fibrin by plasmin forms fibrino-peptides or fibrin split products (Fig. 6.13).\\nThe actions of plasmin in inflammation are as follows:\\nactivation of factor XII to form prekallikrein activator that\\nstimulates the kinin system to generate bradykinin;\\nsplits off complement C3 to form C3a which is a\\npermeability factor; and\\ndegrades fibrin to form fibrin split products which\\nincrease vascular permeability and are chemotactic toleucocytes.\\n4. THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM.  The activation of\\ncomplement system can occur either:\\ni)by classic pathway  through antigen-antibody complexes;\\nor\\nii) b\\ny alternate pathway  via non-immunologic agents such as\\nbacterial toxins, cobra venoms and IgA.\\nComplement system on activation by either of these two\\npathways yields activated products which include140SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nanaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a and C5a),  and membrane attack\\ncomplex (MAC) i.e. C5b,C6,7,8,9.\\nThe actions of activated complement system in\\ninflammation are as under:\\nC3a, C5a, C4a (anaphylatoxins) activate mast cells and\\nbasophils to release of histamine, cause increased vascular\\npermeability causing oedema in tissues, augmentsphagocytosis.\\nC3b is an opsonin.\\nC5a is chemotactic for leucocytes.\\nMembrane attack complex (MAC) (C5b-C9) is a lipid\\ndissolving agent and causes holes in the phospholipidmembrane of the cell.\\nREGULATION OF INFLAMMATION\\nThe onset of inflammatory responses outlined above may\\nhave potentially damaging influence on the host tissues asevident in hypersensitivity conditions. Such self-damagingeffects are kept in check by the host mechanisms in order to\\nresolve inflammation. These mechanisms are as follows:\\ni) Acute phase reactants.  A variety of acute phase reactant\\n(APR) proteins are released in plasma in response to tissue\\ntrauma and infection. Their major role is to protect the normalcells from harmful effects of toxic molecules generated in\\ninflammation and to clear away the waste material. APRs\\ninclude the following:\\ni) Certain cellular protection factors  (e.g. α\\n1-antitrypsin, α1-\\nchymotrypsin, α2-antiplasmin, plasminogen activator\\ninhibitor): They protect the tissues from cytotoxic and\\nproteolytic damage.\\nii) Some coagulation proteins  (e.g. fibrinogen, plasminogen, von\\nWillebrand factor, factor VIII): They generate factors to\\nreplace those consumed in coagulation.\\niii) Transport proteins  (e.g. ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin): They\\ncarry generated factors.iv) Immune agents  (e.g. serum amyloid A and P component,\\nC-reactive protein): CRP is an opsonising agent for\\nphagocytosis and its levels are a useful indictor of\\ninflammation in the body.\\nv) Stress proteins  (e.g. heat shock proteins—HSP, ubiquitin):\\nThey are molecular chaperons who carry the toxic waste\\nwithin the cell to the lysosomes.\\nvi) Antioxidants  (e.g. ceruloplasmin are active in elimination\\nof excess of oxygen free radicals.\\nThe APR are synthesised mainly in the liver, and to some\\nextent in macrophages. APR along with systemic features of\\nfever and leucocytosis is termed ‘acute phase response’.Figure 6.10 Inter-relationship among clotting, fibrinolytic, kinin and complement systems.\\nFigure 6.11 Pathway of kinin system.\\n141CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\nDeficient synthesis of APR leads to severe form of disease in\\nthe form of chronic and repeated inflammatory responses.\\nii) Glucosteroids.  The endogenous glucocorticoids act as\\nanti-inflammatory agents. Their levels are raised in infection\\nand trauma by self-regulating mechanism.\\niii) Free cytokine receptors.  The presence of freely circulating\\nsoluble receptors for cytokines in the serum correlates directly\\nwith disease activity.\\niv) Anti-inflammatory chemical mediators.  As already\\ndescribed, PGE2 or prostacyclin have both pro-inflammatory\\nas well as anti-inflammatory actions.\\nTHE INFLAMMATORY CELLS\\nThe cells participating in acute and chronic inflammation are\\ncirculating leucocytes, plasma cells and tissue macrophages.\\nThe structure, function and production of these cells are dealtwith in detail in Chapter 14. Here, it is pertinent to describethe role of these ce lls in inflammation. Summary of their\\nmorphology, characteristics and functions is given in\\nTable 6.3.1.Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils (PMNs)\\nCommonly called as neutrophils or polymorphs, these cellsalong with basophils and eosinophils are known asgranulocytes due to the presence of granules in thecytoplasm. These granules contain many substances likeproteases, myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, esterase, arylsulfatase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and cationicproteins. The diameter of neutrophils ranges from 10 to15 μm and are actively motile (Table 6.3,A) . These cells\\ncomprise 40-75% of circulating leucocytes and their numberis increased in blood (neutrophilia) and tissues in acutebacterial infections. These cells arise in the bone marrow fromstem cells (Chapter 12).\\nThe functions of neutrophils in inflammation are as\\nfollows:\\ni) Initial phagocytosis  of microorganisms as they form the\\nfirst line of body defense in bacterial infection. The steps\\ninvolved are adhesion of neutrophils to vascular endo-thelium, emigration through the vessel wall, chemotaxis,engulfment, degranulation, killing and degradation of theforeign material.\\nii) \\nEngulfment  of antigen-antibody complexes and non-\\nmicrobial material.\\niii)Harmful effect  of neutrophils in causing basement\\nmembrane destruction of the glomeruli and small blood\\nvessels.\\n2. Eosinophils\\nThese are larger than neutrophils but are fewer in number,\\ncomprising 1 to 6% of total blood leucocytes (Table 6.3,E) .\\nEosinophils share many structural and functional similaritieswith neutrophils like their production in the bone marrow,locomotion, phagocytosis, lobed nucleus and presence ofgranules in the cytoplasm containing a variety of enzymes,of which major basic protein and eosinophil cationic proteinare the most important which have bactericidal and toxicaction against helminthic parasites. However, granules ofeosinophils are richer in myeloperoxidase than neutrophilsand lack lysozyme. High level of steroid hormones leads tofall in number of eosinophils and even disappearance fromblood.\\nThe absolute number of eosinophils is increased in the\\nfollowing conditions and, thus, they partake in inflammatoryresponses associated with these conditions:i)allergic conditions;\\nii)parasitic infestations;\\niii)\\nskin diseases; and\\niv) certain malignant lymphomas.\\n3. Basophils (Mast Cells)\\nThe basophils comprise about 1% of circulating leucocytes\\nand are morphologically and pharmacologically similar tomast cells of tissue. These cells contain coarse basophilicgranules in the cytoplasm and a polymorphonuclear nucleus(Table 6.3,F).  These granules are laden with heparin and\\nhistamine. Basophils and mast cells have receptors for IgEand degranulate when cross-linked with antigen.Figure 6.12 Pathway of the clotting system.\\nFigure 6.13 The activation of fibrinolytic system.\\n142SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nThe role of these cells in inflammation are:\\ni) in immediate and delayed type of hypersensitivity\\nreactions; andii) release of histamine by IgE-sensitised basophils.\\n4. Lymphocytes\\nNext to neutrophils, these cells are the most numerous of\\nthe circulating leucocytes (20-45%). Apart from blood,lymphocytes are present in large numbers in spleen, thymus,lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue(MALT). They have scanty cytoplasm and consist almostentirely of nucleus (Table 6.3,C).\\nTheir role in antibody formation (B lymphocytes) and in\\ncell-mediated immunity (T lymphocytes) has been discussedin Chapter 4; in addition these cells participate in thefollowing types of inflammatory responses:i)In tissues , they are dominant cells in chronic inflammation\\nand late stage of acute inflammation.\\nii)In blood , their number is increased (lymphocytosis) in\\nchronic infections like tuberculosis.\\n5. Plasma Cells\\nThese cells are larger than lymphocytes with more abundant\\ncytoplasm and an eccentric nucleus which has cart-wheelpattern of chromatin (Table 6.3,D) . Plasma cells are normally\\nnot seen in peripheral blood. They develop from Blymphocytes and are rich in RNA and γ-globulin in their\\ncytoplasm. There is an interrelationship between\\nplasmacytosis and hyperglobulinaemia. These cells are most\\nactive in antibody synthesis.\\nTheir number is increased in the following conditions:\\ni)prolonged infection with immunological responses e.g.\\nin syphilis, rheumatoid arthritis, tub erculosis;\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 6.3: Morphology and Functions of Inflammatory Cells.\\nMorphology Features Mediators\\ni.

Mononuclear-Phagocyte System\\n(Reticuloendothelial System)\\nThis cell system includes cells derived from 2 sources with\\ncommon morphology, function and origin (Table 6.3,B).\\nThese are as under:\\nBlood monocytes.  These comprise 4-8% of circulating\\nleucocytes.\\nTissue macrophages.  These include the following cells in\\ndifferent tissues:\\ni)Macrophages in inflammation.\\nii)\\nHistiocytes which are macrophages present in\\nconnective tissues.\\niii) Kupffer cells are macrophages of liver cells.iv) Alveolar macrophages (type II pneumocytes) in lungs.\\nv) Macrophages/histiocytes of the bone marrow.\\nvi) Tingible body cells of germinal centres of lymph nodes.\\nvii) Littoral cells of splenic sinusoids.\\nviii) Osteoclasts in the bones.\\nix) Microglial cells of the brain.\\nx) Langerhans’ cells/dendritic histiocytes of the skin.\\nxi) Hoffbauer cells of the placenta.\\nxii) Mesangial cells of glomerulus.\\nThe mononuclear phagocytes are the scavenger cells of\\nthe body as well as participate in immune system of the body(Chapter 4); their functions in inflammation are as under:\\nRole of macrophages in inflammation.  The functions of\\nmononuclear-phagocyte cells are as under:\\ni)Phagocytosis  (cell eating) and pinocytosis  (cell drinking).\\nii)Macrophages on activation  by lymphokines released by T\\nlymphocytes or by non-immunologic stimuli elaborate a\\nvariety of biologically active substances as under:\\na) Proteases like collagenase and elastase which degrade\\ncollagen and elastic tissue.\\nb) Plasminogen activator which activates the fibrinolytic\\nsystem.c) Products of complement.\\nd) Some coagulation factors (factor V and thromboplastin)\\nwhich convert fibrinogen to fibrin.\\ne) Chemotactic agents for other leucocytes.f) Metabolites of arachidonic acid.g) Growth promoting factors for fibroblasts, blood vessels\\nand granulocytes.\\nh) Cytokines like interleukin-1 and TNF- α.\\ni) Oxygen-derived free radicals.\\n7. Giant Cells\\nA few examples of multinucleate giant cells exist in normal\\ntissues (e.g. osteoclasts in the bones, trophoblasts in placenta,megakaryocytes in the bone marrow). However, in chronicinflammation when the macrophages fail to deal withparticles to be removed, they fuse together and formmultinucleated giant cells. Besides, morphologically distinctgiant cells appear in some tumours also. Some of the commontypes of giant cells are described below (Fig. 6.14):\\nA.Giant cells in inflammation:\\n i) Foreign body giant cells.  These contain numerous nuclei (up\\nto 100) which are uniform in size and shape and resemblethe nuclei of macrophages. These nuclei are scatteredthroughout the cytoplasm. These are seen in chronic infectivegranulomas, leprosy and tuberculosis.\\nii)Langhans’ giant cells.  These are seen in tuberculosis and\\nsarcoidosis. Their nuclei are like the nuclei of macrophages\\nand epithelioid cells. These nuclei are arranged either aroundthe periphery in the form of horseshoe or ring, or are clusteredat the two poles of the giant cell.\\niii)Touton giant cells.  These multinucleated cells have\\nvacuolated cytoplasm due to lipid content e.g. in xanthoma.\\niv) Aschoff giant cells.  These multinucleate giant cells are\\nderived from cardiac histiocytes and are seen in rheumatic\\nnodule (Chapter 16).\\nB\\n. Giant cells in tumours:\\ni) Anaplastic cancer giant cells. These are larger, have\\nnumerous nuclei which are hyperchromatic and vary in sizeFigure 6.14 Giant cells of various types. A, Foreign body giant cell with uniform nuclei dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. B, Langhans’ g iant\\ncells with uniform nuclei arranged peripherally or clustered at the two poles. C, Touton giant cell with circular pattern of nu clei and vacuolated\\ncytoplasm. D, Anaplastic tumour giant cell with nuclei of variable size and shape. E, Reed-Sternberg cell. F, Osteoclastic tumo ur giant cell.\\n144SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesand shape. These giant cells are not derived from\\nmacrophages but are formed from dividing nuclei of theneoplastic cells e.g. carcinoma of the liver, various soft tissuesarcomas etc.\\nii) Reed-Sternberg cells.  These are also malignant tumour\\ngiant cells which are generally binucleate and are seen in\\nvarious histologic types of Hodgkin’s lymphomas.\\niii) Giant cell tumour of bone . This tumour of the bones has\\nuniform distribution of osteoclastic giant cells spread in the\\nstroma.\\nFACTORS DETERMINING VARIATION IN\\nINFLAMMA TO\\nRY RESPONSE\\nAlthough acute inflammation is typically characterised byvascular and cellular events with emigration of neutrophilicleucocytes, not all examples of acute inflammation showinfiltration by neutrophils. On the other hand, some chronicinflammatory conditions are characterised by neutrophilicinfiltration. For example, typhoid fever  is an example of acute\\ninflammatory process but the cellular response in it islymphocytic; osteomyelitis  is an example of chronic\\ninflammation but the cellular response in this condition ismainly neutrophilic.\\nThe variation in inflammatory response depends upon a\\nnumber of factors and processes. These are discussed below:\\n1. Factors Involving the Organisms\\ni)Type of injury and infection.  For example, skin reacts\\nto herpes simplex infection by formation of vesicle and to\\nstreptococcal infection by formation of boil; lung reacts topneumococci by occurrence of lobar pneumonia while totubercle bacilli it reacts by granulomatous inflammation.\\ni\\ni) Virulence.  Many species and strains of organisms may\\nhave varying virulence e.g. the three strains of C. diphtheriae\\n(gravis, intermedius and mitis)  produce the same diphtherial\\nexotoxin but in different amount.iii)Dose.  The concentration of organism in small doses\\nproduces usually local lesions while larger dose results in\\nmore severe spreading infections.\\niv) Portal of entry.  Some organisms are infective only if\\nadministered by particular route e.g. Vibrio cholerae  is not\\npathogenic if injected subcutaneously but causes cholera if\\nswallowed.\\nv) Product of organisms.  Some organisms produce enzymes\\nthat help in spread of infections e.g. hyaluronidase by\\nClostridium welchii , streptokinase by streptococci,\\nstaphylokinase and coagulase by staphylococci.\\n2. Factors Involving the Host\\ni)Systemic diseases.  Certain acquired systemic diseases\\nin the host are associated with impaired inflammatory\\nresponse e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, cirrhosisof the liver, chronic alcoholism, bone marrow suppressionfrom various causes (drugs, radiation, idiopathic). Theseconditions render the host more susceptible to infections.i\\ni) Immune status of host.  Patients who are immuno-\\nsuppressed from congenital or acquired immunodeficiencyhave lowered inflammatory response and spread ofinfections occurs rapidly e.g. in AIDS, congenital immuno-deficiency diseases, protein calorie malnutrition, starvation.\\niii)Congenital neutrophil defects. Congenital defects in\\nneutrophil structure and functions result in reduced\\ninflammatory response.\\niv) Leukopenia.  Patients with low WBC count with\\nneutropenia or agranulocytosis develop spreading infection.\\nv) Site or type of tissue involved.  For example, the lung\\nhas loose texture as compared to bone and, thus, both tissues\\nreact differently to acute inflammation.\\nvi) Local host factors.  For instance, ischaemia, presence of\\nforeign bodies and chemicals cause necrosis and are thus\\ncause more harm.\\n3. Type of Exudation\\nThe appearance of escaped plasma determines the morpho-\\nlogic type of inflammation as under:\\ni) Serous , when the fluid exudate resembles serum or is\\nwatery e.g. pleural effusion in tuberculosis, blister formation\\nin burns.\\nii) Fibrinous , when the fibrin content of the fluid exudate is\\nhigh e.g. in pneumococcal and rheumatic pericarditis.iii)Purulent or suppurative exudate  is formation of creamy\\npus as seen in infection with pyogenic bacteria e.g. abscess,\\nacute appendicitis.\\niv) Haemorrhagic , when there is vascular damage e.g. acute\\nhaemorrhagic pneumonia in influenza.\\nv) Catarrhal , when the surface inflammation of epithelium\\nproduces increased secretion of mucous e.g. common cold.\\nMORPHOLOGY OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION\\nInflammation of an organ is usually named by adding the\\nsuffix- itis to its Latin name e.g. appendicitis, hepatitis,\\ncholecystitis, meningitis etc. A few morphologic varieties ofacute inflammation are described below:\\n1. PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS INFLAMMATION.  It is\\ninflammatory response of mucous surface (oral, respiratory,\\nbowel) to toxins of diphtheria or irritant gases. As a result ofdenudation of epithelium, plasma exudes on the surfacewhere it coagulates, and together with necrosed epithelium,forms false membrane that gives this type of inflammationits name.\\n2. ULCER.  Ulcers are local defects on the surface of an organ\\nproduced by inflammation. Common sites for ulcerations are\\nthe stomach, duodenum, intestinal ulcers in typhoid fever,intestinal tuberculosis, bacillary and amoebic dysentery,ulcers of legs due to varicose veins etc. In the acute stage,there is infiltration by polymorphs with vasodilatation whilelong-standing ulcers develop infiltration by lymphocytes,plasma cells and macrophages with associated fibroblasticproliferation and scarring.145CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing3. SUPPURATION (ABSCESS FORMATION).  When\\nacute bacterial infection is accompanied by intense\\nneutrophilic infiltrate in the inflamed tissue, it results in tissuenecrosis. A cavity is formed which is called an abscess andcontains purulent exudate or pus and the process of abscessformation is known as suppuration. The bacteria which causesuppuration are called pyogenic.\\nMicroscopically,  pus is creamy or opaque in appearance\\nand is composed of numerous dead as well as livingneutrophils, some red cells, fragments of tissue debris andfibrin. In old pus, macrophages and cholesterol crystalsare also present  (Fig. 6.15).\\nAn abscess may be discharged to the surface due to\\nincreased pressure inside or may require drainage by thesurgeon. Due to tissue destruction, resolution does not occurbut instead healing by fibrous scarring takes place.\\nSome of the common examples of abscess formation are\\nas under:\\ni)Boil or furruncle  which is an acute inflammation via hair\\nfollicles in the dermal tissues.\\nii)Carbuncle  is seen in untreated diabetics and occurs as a\\nloculated abscess in the dermis and soft tissues of the neck.\\n4. CELLULITIS.  It is a diffuse inflammation of soft tissues\\nresulting from spreading effects of substances like\\nhyaluronidase released by some bacteria.\\n5. BACTERIAL INFECTION OF THE BLOOD.  This\\nincludes the following 3 conditions:\\ni) Bacteraemia  is defined as presence of small number of\\nbacteria in the blood which do not multiply significantly.\\nThey are commonly not detected by direct microscopy. Bloodculture is done for their detection e.g. infection withSalmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus viridans .\\nii)\\nSepticaemia  means presence of rapidly multiplying,\\nhighly pathogenic bacteria in the blood e.g. pyogenic cocci,bacilli of plague etc. Septicaemia is generally accompaniedby systemic effects like toxaemia, multiple smallhaemorrhages, neutrophilic leucocytosis and disseminatedintravascular coagulation (DIC).\\niii)Pyaemia  is the dissemination of small septic thrombi in\\nthe blood which cause their effects at the site where they are\\nlodged. This can result in pyaemic abscesses or septic infarcts.\\na)Pyaemic abscesses  are multiple small abscesses in various\\norgans such as in cerebral cortex, myocardium, lungs and\\nrenal cortex, resulting from very small emboli fragmentedfrom septic thrombus. Microscopy of pyaemic abscessshows a central zone of necrosis containing numerousbacteria, surrounded by a zone of suppuration and anouter zone of acute inflammatory cells (Fig. 6.16,A).\\nb)Septic infarcts  result from lodgement of larger fragments\\nof septic thrombi in the arteries with relatively larger fociof necrosis, suppuration and acute inflammation e.g.septic infarcts of the lungs, liver, brain, and kidneys fromseptic thrombi of leg veins or from acute bacterialendocarditis (Fig. 6.16,B).\\nSYSTEMIC EFFECTS OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION\\nThe account of acute inflammation given up to now above isbased on local tissue responses. However, acuteinflammation is associated with systemic effects as well.These include fever, leucocytosis and lymphangitis-lymphadenitis.\\n1.Fever\\n occurs due to bacteraemia. It is thought to be\\nmediated through release of factors like prostaglandins,\\ninterleukin-1 and TNF- α in response to infection.\\n2. Leucocytosis  commonly accompanies the acute\\ninflammatory reactions, usually in the range of 15,000-20,000/ μl. When the counts are higher than this with ‘shift\\nto left’ of myeloid cells, the blood picture is described asleukaemoid reaction. Usually, in bacterial infections there is\\nFigure 6.15 An abscess in the skin. It contains pus composed of necrotic tissue, debris, fibrin, RBCs and dead and living neutrophils. Some\\nmacrophages are seen at the periphery.\\n146SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nneutrophilia; in viral infections lymphocytosis; and in\\nparasitic infestations, eosinophilia. Typhoid fever, anexample of acute inflammation, however, induces leucopeniawith relative lymphocytosis.\\n3. Lymphangitis-lymphadenitis  is one of the important\\nmanifestations of localised inflammatory injury. The\\nlymphatics and lymph nodes that drain the inflamedtissue show reactive inflammatory changes in the formof lymphangitis and lymphadenitis. This responserepresents either a nonspecific reaction to mediatorsreleased from inflamed tissue or is an immunologicresponse to a foreign antigen. The affected lymph nodesmay show hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles (follicularhyperplasia) and proliferation of mononuclear phago-cytic cells in the sinuses of lymph node (sinus histio-cytosis) (Chapter 14).\\n4. Shock may occur in severe cases. Massive release of\\ncytokine TNF- α, a mediator of inflammation, in response\\nto severe tissue injury or infection results in profuse\\nsystemic vasodilatation, increased vascular permeabilityand intravascular volume loss. The net effect of these\\nchanges is hypotension and shock. Systemic activation of\\ncoagulation pathway may occur leading to microthrombithroughout the body and result in disseminatedintravascular coagulation (DIC), bleeding and death.FATE OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION\\nThe acute inflammatory process can culminate in one of the\\nfollowing outcomes (Fig. 6.17):\\n1.Resolution.  It means complete return to normal tissue\\nfollowing acute inflammation. This occurs when tissuechanges are slight and the cellular changes are reversible e.g.resolution in lobar pneumonia.\\n2. Healing.  Healing by fibrosis takes place when the tissue\\ndestruction in acute inflammation is extensive so that there\\nis no tissue regeneration. But when tissue loss is superficial,it is restored by regeneration.\\n3.Suppuration.  When the pyogenic bacteria causing acute\\ninflammation result in severe tissue necrosis, the process\\nprogresses to suppuration. Initially, there is intense neutro-philic infiltration. Subsequently, mixture of neutrophils,\\nbacteria, fragments of necrotic tissue, cell debris and fibrin\\ncomprise pus which is contained in a cavity to form anabscess. The abscess, if not drained, may get organised bydense fibrous tissue, and in time, get calcified.\\n4\\n. Chronic inflammation.  Persisting or recurrent acute\\ninflammation may progress to chronic inflammation in which\\nthe processes of inflammation and healing proceed side by\\nside.Figure 6.16 Sequelae of pyaemia.\\n147CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\nCHRONIC INFLAMMATION\\nDEFINITION AND CAUSES.  Chronic inflammation is\\ndefined as prolonged process in which tissue destruction and\\ninflammation occur at the same time.\\nChronic inflammation can be caused by one of the\\nfollowing 3 ways:\\n1. Chronic inflammation following acute inflammation.\\nWhen the tissue destruction is extensive, or the bacteriasurvive and persist in small numbers at the site of acuteinflammation e.g. in osteomyelitis, pneumonia terminatingin lung abscess.\\n2.Recurrent attacks of acute inflammation.  When\\nrepeated bouts of acute inflammation culminate in\\nchronicity of the process e.g. in recurrent urinary tractinfection leading to chronic pyelonephritis, repeated acuteinfection of gallbladder leading to chronic cholecystitis.\\n3.\\nChronic inflammation starting de novo.  When the infec-\\ntion with organisms of low pathogenicity is chronic from the\\nbeginning e.g. infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis .\\nGENERAL FEATURES OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION\\nThough there may be differences in chronic inflammatory\\nresponse depending upon the tissue involved and causativeorganisms, there are some basic similarities amongst varioustypes of chronic inflammation. Following general featurescharacterise any chronic inflammation:\\n1. MONONUCLEAR CELL INFILTRATION.  Chronic\\ninflammatory lesions are infiltrated by mononuclear\\ninflammatory cells like phagocytes and lymphoid cells.Phagocytes are represented by circulating monocytes, tissuemacrophages, epithelioid cells and sometimes,multinucleated giant cells. The macrophages comprise themost important cells in chronic inflammation. These mayappear at the site of chronic inflammation from:\\ni) chemotactic factors and adhesion molecules for continued\\ninfiltration of macrophages;\\nii\\n) local proliferation of macrophages; and\\niii)longer survival of macrophages at the site of inflam-\\nmation.\\nThe blood monocytes on reaching the extravascular space\\ntransform into tissue macrophages. Besides the role of\\nmacrophages in phagocytosis, they may get activated inresponse to stimuli such as cytokines (lymphokines) andbacterial endotoxins. On activation, macrophages releaseseveral biologically active substances e.g. acid and neutralproteases, oxygen-derived reactive metabolites andcytokines. These products bring about tissue destruction,neovascularisation and fibrosis.\\nOther chronic inflammatory cells include lymphocytes,\\nplasma cells, eosinophils and mast cells. In chronic inflam-mation, lymphocytes and macrophages influence each otherand release mediators of inflammation.\\n2. TISSUE DESTRUCTION OR NECROSIS.  Tissue\\ndestruction and necrosis are central features of most forms\\nof chronic inflammatory lesions. This is brought about byactivated macrophages which release a variety of biologi-cally active substances e.g. protease, elastase, collagenase,lipase, reactive oxygen radicals, cytokines (IL-1, IL-8,TNF- α), nitric oxide, angiogenesis growth factor etc.\\n3. PROLIFERATIVE CHANGES.  As a result of necrosis,\\nproliferation of small blood vessels and fibroblasts isstimulated resulting in formation of inflammatorygranulation tissue. Eventually, healing by fibrosis andcollagen laying takes place.\\nSYSTEMIC EFFECTS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION\\nChronic inflammation is associated with following systemic\\nfeatures:\\n1. Fever.  Invariably there is mild fever, often with loss of\\nweight and weakness.2. Anaemia.  As discussed in Chapter 12, chronic inflam-\\nmation is accompanied by anaemia of varying degree.3. Leucocytosis.  As in acute inflammation, chronic\\ninflammation also has leucocytosis but generally there is\\nrelative lymphocytosis in these cases.\\n4. ESR.  ESR is elevated in all cases of chronic inflammation.\\n5. Amyloidosis.  Long-term cases of chronic suppurative\\ninflammation may develop secondary systemic (AA)\\namyloidosis.\\nTYPES OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION\\nConventionally, chronic inflammation is subdivided into 2\\ntypes:Figure 6.17 Fate of acute inflammation.\\n148SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques1. Non-specific,  when the irritant substance produces a non-\\nspecific chronic inflammatory reaction with formation of\\ngranulation tissue and healing by fibrosis e.g. chronic\\nosteomyelitis, chronic ulcer.\\n2. Specific,  when the injurious agent causes a characteri-\\nstic histologic tissue response e.g. tuberculosis, leprosy,\\nsyphilis.\\nHowever, for a more descriptive classification, histo-\\nlogical features are used for classifying chronic inflammationinto 2 corresponding types:\\n1.Chronic non-specific inflammation.  It is characterised\\nby non-specific inflammatory cell infiltration e.g. chronic\\nosteomyelitis, lung abscess. A variant of this type of chronicinflammatory response is chronic suppurative inflammation\\nin which infiltration by polymorphs and abscess formation\\nare additional features e.g. actinomycosis.\\n2.Chronic granulomatous inflammation.  It is characterised\\nby formation of granulomas e.g. tuberculosis, leprosy,\\nsyphilis, actinomycosis, sarcoidosis etc.\\nGRANULOMA\\nTOUS INFLAMMATION\\nGranuloma  is defined as a circumscribed, tiny lesion, about\\n1 mm in diameter, composed predominantly of collection of\\nmodified macrophages called epithelioid cells, and rimmedat the periphery by lymphoid cells. The word ‘granuloma’  is\\nderived from granule  meaning circumscribed granule-like\\nlesion, and -oma  which is a suffix commonly used for true\\ntumours but here it indicates a localised inflammatory massor collection of macrophages.\\nPATHOGENESIS OF GRANULOMA.  Formation of\\ngranuloma is a type IV granulomatous hypersensitivity\\nreaction (page 77). It is a protective defense reaction by the\\nhost but eventually causes tissue destruction because ofpersistence of the poorly digestible antigen e.g. Mycobacterium\\ntuberculosis,  M. leprae , suture material, particles of talc etc.\\nThe sequence in evolution of granuloma is schematically\\nshown in Fig. 6.18  and is briefly outlined below:\\n1. Engulfment by macrophages.  Macrophages and\\nmonocytes engulf the antigen and try to destroy it. But sincethe antigen is poorly degradable, these cells fail to digest\\nand degrade the antigen, and instead undergo morphologic\\nchanges to epithelioid cells.\\n2. CD4+ T cells . Macrophages, being antigen-presenting\\ncells, having failed to deal with the antigen, present it to CD4+\\nT lymphocytes. These lymphocytes get activated andelaborate lymphokines (IL-1, IL-2, interferon- γ, TNF- α).\\n3. Cytokines.  Various cytokines formed by activated CD4+\\nT cells and also by activated macrophages perform thefollowing roles:\\ni) IL-1 and IL-2  stimulate proliferation of more T cells.\\nii) Interferon- γ activates macrophages.\\niii) TNF- α promotes fibroblast proliferation and activates\\nendothelium to secrete prostaglandins which have role in\\nvascular response in inflammation.iv) Growth factors  (transforming growth factor- β, platelet-\\nderived growth factor) elaborated by activated macrophages\\nstimulate fibroblast growth.\\nThus, a granuloma is formed of macrophages modified\\nas epithelioid cells in the centre, with some interspersedmultinucleate giant cells, surrounded peripherally bylymphocytes (mainly T cells), and  healing by fibroblasts orcollagen depending upon the age of granuloma.\\nCOMPOSITION OF GRANULOMA.  In general, a\\ngranuloma has the following structural composition:\\n1.Epithelioid cells.  These are so called because of their\\nepithelial cell-like appearance, are modified macrophages/\\nhistiocytes which are somewhat elongated, having vesicularand lightly-staining slipper-shaped nucleus, and pale-Figure 6.18 Mechanism of evolution of a granuloma (IL=interleukin;\\nIFN= interferon; TNF = tumour necrosis factor).\\n149CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healingstaining abundant cytoplasm with hazy outlines so that the\\ncell membrane of adjacent epithelioid cells is closely apposed.Epithelioid cells are weakly phagocytic.\\n2. Multinucleate giant cells.  Multinucleate giant cells are\\nformed by fusion of adjacent epithelioid cells and may have\\n20 or more nuclei. These nuclei may be arranged at theperiphery like horseshoe or ring, or are clustered at the twopoles (Langhans’ giant cells), or they may be present centrally(foreign body giant cells). The former are commonly seen intuberculosis while the latter are common in foreign bodytissue reactions. Like epithelioid cells, these giant cells areweakly phagocytic but produce secretory products whichhelp in removing the invading agents.\\n3. Lymphoid cells. As a cell mediated immune reaction to\\nantigen, the host response by lymphocytes is integral to\\ncomposition of a granuloma. Plasma cells indicative ofaccelerated humoral immune response are present in sometypes of granulomas.\\n4. Necrosis.  Necrosis may be a feature of some granulo-\\nmatous conditions e.g. central caseation necrosis of\\ntuberculosis, so called because of cheese-like appearance andconsistency of necrosis.\\n5. Fibrosis.  Fibrosis is a feature of healing by proliferating\\nfibroblasts at the periphery of granuloma.\\nThe classical example of granulomatous inflammation is\\nthe tissue response to tubercle bacilli which is called tubercle\\nseen in tuberculosis (described below). A fully-developed\\ntubercle is about 1 mm in diameter with central area ofcaseation necrosis, surrounded by epithelioid cells and oneto several multinucleated giant cells (commonly Langhans’type), surrounded at the periphery by lymphocytes andbounded by fibroblasts and fibrous tissue (Fig. 6.19).EXAMPLES OF GRANULOMATOUS\\nINFLAMMATION\\nGranulomatous inflammation is typical of reaction to poorlydigestible agents elicited by tuberculosis, leprosy, fungalinfections, schistosomiasis, foreign particles etc. Acomprehensive list of important examples of granulomatousconditions, their etiologic agents and salient features is givenin Table 6.4 . The principal examples (marked with asterisk\\nin the table) are discussed below while a few others appearin relevant Chapters later.\\nTUBERCULOSIS\\nTissue response in tuberculosis represents classical example\\nof chronic granulomatous inflammation in humans.\\nCAUSATIVE ORGANISM.  Tubercle bacillus or Koch’s\\nbacillus (named after discovery of the organism by Robert\\nKoch in 1882) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis  causes\\ntuberculosis in the lungs and other tissues of the human body.The organism is a strict aerobe and thrives best in tissues withhigh oxygen tension such as in the apex of the lung.\\nOut of various pathogenic strains for human disease\\nincluded in Mycobacterium tuberculosis  complex, currently\\nmost common is M. tuberculosis hominis (human strain), while\\nM. tuberculosis bovis  (bovine strain) used to be common\\npathogen to human beings during the era of consumption ofunpasteurised milk but presently constitutes a small numberof human cases. Other less common strains included in thecomplex are M. africanum  (isolated from patients from parts\\nof Africa), M. microti , M. pinnipedii  and M. canettii.  A non-\\npathogenic strain, M. smegmatis , is found in the smegma and\\nas contaminant in the urine of both men and women.\\nM. tuberculosis hominis  is a slender rod-like bacillus,\\n0.5 μm by 3 μm, is neutral on Gram staining, and can be\\ndemonstrated by the following methods:\\n1.Acid fast (Ziehl-Neelsen) staining.  The acid fastness of the\\ntubercle bacilli is due to mycolic acids, cross-linked fatty acids\\nand other lipids in the cell wall of the organism making itimpermeable to the usual stains. It takes up stain by heatedcarbol fuchsin and resists decolourisation by acids andalcohols (acid fast and alcohol fast) and can be decolourisedby 20% sulphuric acid (compared to 5% sulphuric acid fordeclourisation for M. leprae  which are less acid fast) (Fig. 6.20) .\\nFalse positive AFB staining is seen due to Nocardia ,\\nRhodococcus , Legionella , and some protozoa such as Isospora\\nand Cryptosporidium .\\n2.Fluorescent dye methods.\\n3.Culture  of the organism from sputum in Lowenstein-\\nJensen (L.J.) medium for 6 weeks.\\n4.Guinea pig inoculation  method by subcutaneous injection\\nof the organisms.5.Molecular methods  such as PCR are the most recent\\nmethods.\\nATYPICAL MYCOBACTERIA (NON-TUBERCULOUS\\nMYCOBACTERIA).  The term atypical mycobacteria or non-\\ntuberculous mycobacteria is used for mycobacterial species\\nFigure 6.19 Morphology of a tubercle.

Non-\\ntuberculous mycobacteria are widely distributed in the\\nenvironment and are, therefore, also called as environmental\\nmycobacteria . They too are acid fast. Occasionally, human\\ntuberculosis may be caused by atypical mycobacteria whichare non-pathogenic to guinea pigs and resistant to usual anti-tubercular drugs.Conventionally, atypical mycobacteria are classified on\\nthe basis of colour of colony produced in culture and thespeed of growth in media:\\nRapid growers.  These organisms grow fast on solid media\\n(within 7 days) but are less pathogenic than others. Examples\\ninclude M. abscessus , M.fortuitum, M. chelonae.151CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\nSlow growers. These species grow mycobacteria on solid\\nmedia (in 2-3 weeks). Based on the colour of colony formed,\\nthey are further divided into following:\\nPhotochromogens:  These organisms produce yellow pigment\\nin the culture grown in light.\\nScotochromogens:  Pigment is produced, whether the growth\\nis in light or in dark.\\nNon-chromogens:  No pigment is produced by the bacilli and\\nthe organism is closely related to avium bacillus.\\nThe examples of slow growers are M. avium-intracellulare,\\nM. kansasii, M. ulcerans and M. fortuitum.\\nThe infection by atypical mycobacteria is acquired\\ndirectly from the environment, unlike person-to-person\\ntransmission of classical tuberculosis. They produce humandisease,  atypical mycobacteriosis,  similar to tuberculosis but\\nare much less virulent. The lesions produced may begranulomas, nodular collection of foamy cells, or acuteinflammation.\\nFive patterns of the disease are recognised:\\ni) Pulmonary disease produced by M. kansasii or M. avium-\\nintracellulare .\\nii) Lymphadenitis caused by M. avium-intracellulare or M.\\nscrofulaceum.\\niii) U lcerated skin lesions produced by M. ulcerans or M.\\nmarinum.\\niv) Abscesses caused by M.fortuitum or M. chelonae.\\nv) Bacteraemias by M. avium-intracellulare as seen in\\nimmunosuppressed patients of AIDS.\\nINCIDENCE.  In spite of great advances in chemotherapy\\nand immunology, tuberculosis still continues to be\\nworldwide in distribution, more common in developingcountries of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Other factorscontributing to higher incidence of tuberculosis aremalnutrition, inadequate medical care, poverty, crowding,chronic debilitating conditions like uncontrolled diabetes,alcoholism and immunocompromised states like AIDS.However, the exact incidence of disease cannot bedetermined as all patients infected with M. tuberculosis  may\\nnot develop the clinical disease and many cases remainreactive to tuberculin without developing symptomaticdisease.\\nHIV-ASSOCIATED TUBERCULOSIS.  HIV-infected\\nindividuals have very high incidence of tuberculosis all over\\nthe world. Vice-versa, rate of HIV infection in patients oftuberculosis is very high.  Moreover, HIV-infected individualon acquiring infection with tubercle bacilli develops activedisease rapidly (within few weeks) rather than after monthsor years. Pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV presents in typicalmanner. However, it is more often sputum smear negativebut often culture positive. Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis ismore common in HIV disease and manifests commonly byinvolving lymph nodes, pleura, pericardium, andtuberculous meningitis. Infection with M. avium-intracellulare\\n(avian or bird strain) is common in patients with HIV/AIDS.\\nMODE OF TRANSMISSION.  Human beings acquire\\ninfection with tubercle bacilli by one of the following routes:\\n1.Inhalation  of organisms present in fresh cough droplets\\nor in dried sputum from an open case of pulmonary\\ntuberculosis.\\n2.Ingestion  of the organisms leads to development of tonsi-\\nllar or intestinal tuberculosis. This mode of infection of\\nhuman tubercle bacilli is from self-swallowing of infectedsputum of an open case of pulmonary tuberculosis, oringestion of bovine tubercle bacilli from milk of diseasedcows.\\n3.Inoculation  of the organisms into the skin may rarely occur\\nfrom infected postmortem tissue.\\n4.Transplacental route  results in development of congenital\\ntuberculosis in foetus from infected mother and is a rare mode\\nof transmission.\\nSPREAD OF TUBERCULOSIS.  The disease spreads in the\\nbody by various routes:\\n1.Local spread.  This takes place by macrophages carrying\\nthe bacilli into the surrounding tissues.\\n2. Lymphatic spread.  Tuberculosis is primarily an infection\\nof lymphoid tissues. The bacilli may pass into lymphoid\\nfollicles of pharynx, bronchi, intestines or regional lymphnodes resulting in regional tuberculous lymphadenitis whichis typical of childhood infections. Primary complex is primaryfocus with lymphangitis and lymphadenitis.\\n3.\\nHaematogenous spread.  This occurs either as a result of\\ntuberculous bacillaemia because of the drainage of\\nlymphatics into the venous system or due to caseous mate-rial escaping through ulcerated wall of a vein. This producesmillet seed-sized lesions in different organs of the body likelungs, liver, kidneys, bones and other tissues and is knownas miliary tuberculosis.\\n4. By the natural passages.  Infection may spread from:\\ni) lung lesions into pleura (tuberculous pleurisy);\\nii) transbronchial spread into the adjacent lung segments;Figure 6.20 Tuberculosis of the lymph nodes showing presence of\\nacid-fast bacilli in Ziehl-Neelsen staining.\\n152SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesiii)tuberculous salpingitis into peritoneal cavity (tuberculous\\nperitonitis);\\niv) infected sputum into larynx (tuberculous laryngitis);\\nv) swallowing of infected sputum (ileocaecal tuberculosis);\\nand\\nvi) renal lesions into ureter and down to trigone of bladder.\\nHYPERSENSITIVITY AND IMMUNITY IN TUBER-\\nCULOSIS.  Hypersensitivity or allergy, and immunity or\\nresistance, play a major role in the development of lesions intuberculosis. Tubercle bacilli as such do not produce anytoxins. Tissue changes seen in tuberculosis are not the resultof any exotoxin or endotoxin but are instead the result ofhost response to the organism which is in the form ofdevelopment of cell-mediated hypersensitivity (or type IVhypersensitivity) and immunity. Both these host responsesdevelop as a consequence of several lipids present in themicroorganism which include the following:\\n1.mycosides such as ‘cord factor’ which are essential for\\ngrowth and virulence of the organism in the animals; and\\n2. glycolipids  present in the mycobacterial cell wall like\\n‘Wax-D’  which acts as an adjuvant acting along with\\ntuberculoprotein.\\nIt has been known since the time of Robert Koch that the\\ntissue reaction to tubercle bacilli is different in healthy animal\\nnot previously infected (primary infection) from an animalwho is previously infected (secondary infection).\\n1.\\nIn the primary infection,  intradermal injection of tubercle\\nbacilli into the skin of a healthy guinea pig evokes no visible\\nreaction for 10-14 days. After this period, a nodule developsat the inoculation site which subsequently ulcerates and healspoorly as the guinea pig, unlike human beings, does notpossess any natural resistance. The regional lymph nodesalso develop tubercles. This process is a manifestation ofdelayed type of hypersensitivity (type IV reaction) and iscomparable to primary tuberculosis in children althoughhealing invariably occurs in children.\\n2. In the secondary infection,  the sequence of changes is\\ndifferent. The tubercle bacilli are injected into the skin of the\\nguinea pig who has been infected with tuberculosis 4-6 weeksearlier. In 1-2 days, the site of inoculation is indurated anddark, attaining a diameter of about 1 cm. The skin lesionulcerates which heals quickly and the regional lymph nodesare not affected. This is called Koch’s phenomenon  and is\\nindicative of hypersensitivity and immunity in the host.\\nSimilar type of changes can be produced if injection of\\nlive tubercle bacilli is replaced with old tuberculin (OT).\\nHypersensitivity and immunity are closely related and\\nare initiated through CD4+ T lymphocytes sensitised againstspecific antigens in tuberculin. As a result of this sensitisation,lymphokines are released from T cells which induceincreased microbicidal activity of the macrophages.\\nTuberculin (Mantoux) skin test.  This test is done by\\nintradermal injection of 0.1 ml of tuberculoprotein, purified\\nprotein derivative (PPD). Delayed type of hypersensitivitydevelops in individuals who are having or have beenpreviously infected with tuberculous infection which isidentified as an indurated area of more than 15 mm in 72hours. However, patients having disseminated tuberculosismay show negative test due to release of large amount oftuberculoproteins from the endogenous lesions masking thehypersensitivity test. A positive test is indicative of cell-mediated hypersensitivity to tubercular antigens but doesnot distinguish between infection and disease. The test maybe false positive in atypical mycobacterial infection and falsenegative in sarcoidosis, some viral infections, Hodgkin’sdisease and fulminant tuberculosis.\\nImmunisation against tuberculosis.  Protective immuni-\\nsation against tuberculosis is induced by injection of\\nattenuated strains of bovine type of tubercle bacilli, Bacille\\nCalmette-Guérin (BCG). Cell-mediated immunity with\\nconsequent delayed hypersensitivity reaction develops withhealing of the lesion, but the cell-mediated immunity persists,rendering the host tuberculin-positive and hence immune.\\nEVOLUTION OF TUBERCLE.  The sequence of events which\\ntake place when tubercle bacilli are introduced into the tissue\\nare as under (Fig. 6.21):\\n1. When the tubercle bacilli are injected intravenouslyinto the guinea pig, the bacilli are lodged in pulmonary\\nFigure 6.21 Schematic evolution of tubercle. In fully formed\\ngranuloma, the centre is composed of granular caseation necrosis,\\nsurrounded by epithelioid cells and Langhans’ giant cells and peripheralrim of lymphocytes bounded by fibroblasts.\\n153CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healingcapillaries where an initial response of neutrophils  is evoked\\nwhich are rapidly destroyed by the organisms.\\n2. After about 12 hours, there is progressive infiltration by\\nmacrophages.  This is due to coating of tubercle bacilli with\\nserum complement factors C2a and C3b which act as\\nopsonins and attract the macrophages. Macrophagesdominate the picture throughout the remaining life of thelesions. If the tubercle bacilli are, however, inhaled into thelung alveoli, macrophages predominate the picture from thebeginning.\\n3. The macrophages start phagocytosing  the tubercle bacilli\\nand either kill the bacteria or die away themselves. In the\\nlatter case, they further proliferate locally as well as there isincreased recruitment of macrophages from bloodmonocytes.\\n4. As a part of body’s immune response, T and B cells are\\nactivated.  Activated CD4+T cells develop the cell-mediateddelayed type hypersensitivity reaction , while B cells result in\\nformation of antibodies which play no role in body’s defenceagainst tubercle bacilli.\\n5. In 2-3 days, the macrophages undergo structural changes\\nas a result of immune mechanisms—the cytoplasm becomespale and eosinophilic and their nuclei become elongated andvesicular. These modified macrophages resemble epithelialcells and are called epithelioid cells .\\n6. The epithelioid cells in time aggregate into tight clustersor granulomas . Release of cytokines in response to sensitised\\nCD4+T cells and some constituents of mycobacterial cell wallplay a role in formation of granuloma.\\n7. Some of the macrophages form multinucleated giant cells\\nby fusion of adjacent cells. The giant cells may be Langhans’\\ntype having peripherally arranged nuclei in the form ofhorseshoe or ring, or clustered at the two poles of the giantcell; or they may be foreign body type having centrally-placednuclei.\\n8. Around the mass of epithelioid cells and giant cells is a\\nzone of lymphocytes, plasma cells and fibroblasts. The lesionat this stage is called hard tubercle  due to absence of central\\nnecrosis.\\n9. Within 10-14 days, the centre of the cellular mass begins\\nto undergo caseation necrosis, characterised by cheesyappearance and high lipid content. This stage is called soft\\ntubercle  which is the hallmark of tuberculous lesions. The\\ndevelopment of caseation necrosis is possibly due tointeraction of mycobacteria with activated T cells (CD4+helper T cells via IFN- γ and CD8+ suppressor T cells directly)\\nas well as by direct toxicity of mycobacteria on macrophages.Microscopically , caseation necrosis is structureless,\\neosinophilic and granular material with nuclear debris.\\n10. The soft tubercle which is a fully-developed granuloma\\nwith caseous centre does not favour rapid proliferation oftubercle bacilli. Acid-fast  bacilli  are difficult to find in these\\nlesions and may be demonstrated at the margins of recentnecrotic foci and in the walls of the cavities.\\nThe fate of a granuloma  is variable:\\ni) The caseous material may undergo liquefaction andextend into surrounding soft tissues, discharging the contentson the surface. This is called cold abscess  although there are\\nno pus cells in it.\\nii) In tuberculosis of tissues like bones, joints, lymph nodes\\nand epididymis, sinuses are formed and the sinus tracts  are\\nlined by tuberculous granulation tissue.\\niii) The adjacent granulomas may coalesce  together enlarging\\nthe lesion which is surrounded by progressive fibrosis.iv) In the granuloma enclosed by fibrous tissue, calcium salts\\nmay get deposited in the caseous material (dystrophic\\ncalcification)  and sometimes the lesion may even get ossified\\nover the years.\\nTYPES OF TUBERCULOSIS\\nLung is the main organ affected in tuberculosis. Depending\\nupon the type of tissue response and age, the infection withtubercle bacilli is of 2 main types:A.Primary tuberculosis; and\\nB.Secondary tuberculosis.\\nA\\n. Primary Tuberculosis\\nThe infection of an individual who has not been previouslyinfected or immunised is called primary tuberculosis  or Ghon’s\\ncomplex  or childhood tuberculosis .\\nPrimary complex or Ghon’s complex is the lesion\\nproduced in the tissue of portal of entry with foci in thedraining lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. The mostcommonly involved tissues for primary complex are lungsand hilar lymph nodes. Other tissues which may showprimary complex are tonsils and cervical lymph nodes, andin the case of ingested bacilli the lesions may be found insmall intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes.\\nThe incidence of disseminated form of progressive\\nprimary tuberculosis is particularly high in immunocompro-mised host e.g. in patients of AIDS.\\nPrimary complex or Ghon’s complex  in lungs consists of 3\\ncomponents (Fig. 6.22):\\n1. Pulmonary component.  Lesion in the lung is the primary\\nfocus or Ghon’s focus. It is 1-2 cm solitary area of tuberculous\\nFigure 6.22 The primary complex composed of 3 components:\\nGhon’s focus, draining lymphatics, and hilar lymph nodes.\\n154SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\npneumonia located peripherally under a patch of pleurisy,\\nin any part of the lung but more often in subpleural focus inthe upper part of lower lobe.\\nMicroscopically , the lung lesion consists of tuberculous\\ngranulomas with caseation necrosis.\\n2. Lymphatic vessel component.  The lymphatics draining\\nthe lung lesion contain phagocytes containing bacilli and maydevelop beaded, miliary tubercles along the path of hilarlymph nodes.\\n3. Lymph node component.  This consists of enlarged hilar\\nand tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes in the area drained. The\\naffected lymph nodes are matted and show caseation necrosis(Fig. 6.23, A).\\nMicroscopically,  the lesions are characterised by extensive\\ncaseation, tuberculous granulomas and fibrosis.Nodal lesions are potential source of re-infection later(Fig. 6.23, B).\\nIn the case of primary tuberculosis of the alimentary tract\\ndue to ingestion of tubercle bacilli, a small primary focus isseen in the intestine with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodesproducing tabes mesenterica . The enlarged and caseous\\nmesenteric lymph nodes may rupture into peritoneal cavityand cause tuberculous peritonitis.\\nFATE OF PRIMARY TUBERCULOSIS.  Primary complex\\nmay have one of the following sequelae (Fig. 6.24):\\n1. The lesions of primary tuberculosis of lung commonly\\ndo not progress but instead heal by fibrosis,  and in time\\nundergo calcification  and even ossification .\\n2.In some cases, the primary focus in the lung continues to\\ngrow and the caseous material is disseminated throughFigure 6.23 Caseating granulomatous lymphadenitis. A, Cut section of matted mass of lymph nodes shows merging capsules and large areas\\nof caseation necrosis (arrow).

B, Progressive primary tuberculosis spreading to the oth er\\nareas of the same lung or opposite lung. C, Miliary spread to lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and brain. D, Progressive secondary pulmonary tuberculosis\\nfrom reactivation of dormant primary complex.\\n155CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healingbronchi to the other parts of the same lung or the opposite\\nlung. This is called progressive primary tuberculosis .\\n3. At times, bacilli may enter the circulation through erosionin a blood vessel and spread to various tissues and organs.This is called primary  miliary tuberculosis  and the lesions are\\nseen in organs like the liver, spleen, kidney, brain and bonemarrow.\\n4. In certain circumstances like in lowered resistance and\\nincreased hypersensitivity of the host, the healed lesions ofprimary tuberculosis may get reactivated. The bacilli lyingdormant in acellular caseous material are activated and causeprogressive secondary tuberculosis . It affects children more\\ncommonly but adults may also develop this kind ofprogression.\\nB. Secondary Tuberculosis\\nThe infection of an individual who has been previously\\ninfected or sensitised is called secondary , or post-primary  or\\nreinfection , or chronic tuberculosis .\\nThe infection may be acquired from  (Fig. 6.25):\\nendogenous source  such as reactivation of dormant primary\\ncomplex; or\\nexogenous source  such as fresh dose of reinfection by the\\ntubercle bacilli.\\nSecondary tuberculosis occurs most commonly in lungs\\nin the region of apex. Other sites and tissues which can beinvolved are tonsils, pharynx, larynx, small intestine andskin. Secondary tuberculosis of other organs and tissues isdescribed in relevant chapters later while that of lungs isdiscussed here.\\nSecondary Pulmonary Tuberculosis\\nThe lesions in secondary pulmonary tuberculosis usually\\nbegin as 1-2 cm apical area of consolidation of the lung, whichmay in time develop a small area of central caseation necrosisand peripheral fibrosis. It occurs by haematogenous spreadof infection from primary complex to the apex of the affectedlung where the oxygen tension is high and favourable forgrowth of aerobic tubercle bacilli. Microscopically,  the appear-ance is typical of tuberculous granulomas with caseationnecrosis.\\nPatients with HIV infection previously exposed to\\ntuberculous infection have particularly high incidence ofreactivation of primary tuberculosis and the pattern of lesionsin such cases is similar to that of primary tuberculosis i.e.with involvement of hilar lymph nodes rather than cavitaryand apical lesions in the lung. In addition, infection with M.\\navium-intracellulare  occurs more frequently in cases of AIDS.\\nFATE OF SECONDARY PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS.The subapical lesions in lungs can have the following courses:\\n1. The lesions may heal  with fibrous scarring and\\ncalcification.\\n2.The lesions may coalesce  together to form larger area of\\ntuberculous pneumonia and produce progressive secondary\\npulmonary tuberculosis with the following pulmonary andextrapulmonary involvements:i)\\nFibrocaseous tuberculosis\\nii) Tuberculous caseous pneumoniaiii) Miliary tuberculosis.\\nI. FIBROCASEOUS TUBERCULOSIS.  The original area\\nof tuberculous pneumonia undergoes massive central\\ncaseation necrosis which may:\\neither break into a bronchus from a cavity (cavitary or open\\nfibrocaseous tuberculosis) ; or\\nremain, as a soft caseous lesion without drainage into a\\nbronchus or bronchiole to produce a non-cavitary lesion(chronic fibrocaseous tuberculosis) .\\nThe cavity provides favourable environment for\\nproliferation of tubercle bacilli due to high oxygen tension.The cavity may communicate with bronchial tree andbecomes the source of spread of infection (‘open tuberculosis’).\\nThe open case of secondary tuberculosis may implanttuberculous lesion on the mucosal lining of air passagesproducing endobronchial and endotracheal tuberculosis .\\nIngestion of sputum containing tubercle bacilli fromendogenous pulmonary lesions may produce laryngeal and\\nintestinal tuberculosis .\\nGrossly,  tuberculous cavity is spherical with thick fibrous\\nwall, lined by yellowish, caseous, necrotic material andthe lumen is traversed by thrombosed blood vessels.Around the wall of cavity are seen foci of consolidation.The overlying pleura may also be thickened (Fig. 6.26).\\nMicroscopically,  the wall of cavity shows eosinophilic,\\ngranular, caseous material which may show foci ofdystrophic calcification. Widespread coalescedtuberculous granulomas composed of epithelioid cells,Langhans’ giant cells and peripheral mantle oflymphocytes and having central caseation necrosis areseen. The outer wall of cavity shows fibrosis (Fig. 6.27).\\nComplications  of cavitary secondary tuberculosis are as\\nfollows:a) Aneurysms of patent arteries crossing the cavity\\nproducing haemoptysis.b)\\nExtension to pleura producing bronchopleural fistula.Figure 6.25 Progressive secondary tuberculosis.

MILIARY TUBERCULOSIS.  This is lymphohaemato-\\ngenous spread of tuberculous infection from primary focus\\nor later stages of tuberculosis. The spread may occur to\\nsystemic organs or isolated organ. The spread is either by\\nentry of infection into pulmonary vein producing dissemi-nated or isolated organ lesion in different extra-pulmonarysites (e.g. liver, spleen, kidney, brain and bone marrow) or\\n157CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\ncases of tuberculosis may develop systemic secondary\\namyloidosis.\\nThe diagnosis  is made by the following tests:\\ni) Positive Mantoux skin test.\\nii) Positive sputum for AFB (on smear or culture).\\niii) Complete haemogram  (lymphocytosis and raised ERR).iv) Chest X-ray (characteristic hilar nodules and other\\nparenchymal changes).\\nv) Fine needle aspiration cytology of an enlarged peripheral\\nlymph node is quite helpful for confirmation of diagnosis(page 282).\\nCauses of death  in pulmonary tuberculosis are usually\\npulmonary insufficiency, pulmonary haemorrhage, sepsisdue to disseminated miliary tuberculosis, cor pulmonale orsecondary amyloidosis.Figure 6.28 A, Bilateral tuberculous caseous pneumonia.

The sectioned surface of the\\nlung parenchyma shows presence of minute millet-seed sized tubercles.LEPROSY\\nLeprosy or Hansen’s disease (after discovery of the causa-\\ntive organism by Hansen in 1874), was first described inancient Indian text going back to 6th Century BC, is a\\nchronic non-fatal infectious disease affecting mainly thecooler parts of the body such as the skin, mouth, respiratorytract, eyes, peripheral nerves, superficial lymph nodes andtestis. Though the earliest and main involvement in leprosyis of the skin and nerves but in bacteraemia from endothelialcolonisation or by bacilli filtered from blood by reticulo-\\nendothelial system, other organs such as the liver, spleen,\\nbone marrow and regional lymph nodes are also involved.Advanced cases may develop secondary amyloidosis andrenal disease, both of which are of immunologic origin.\\nCausative Organism\\nThe disease is caused by Mycobacterium leprae  which closely\\nresembles Mycobacterium tuberculosis  but is less acid-fast. The\\norganisms in tissues appear as compact rounded masses\\n(globi)  or are arranged in parallel fashion like cigarettes-in-\\npack.\\nM. leprae  can be demonstrated in tissue sections, in split\\nskin smears by splitting the skin, scrapings from cut edgesof dermis, and in nasal smears by the following techniques:1.Acid-fast (Ziehl-Neelsen) staining.  The staining procedure\\nis similar as for demonstration of M. tuberculosis  but can be\\ndecolourised by lower concentration (5%) of sulphuric acid(less acid-fast) (Fig. 6.31).\\n2.Fite-Faraco staining  procedure is a modification of Z.N.\\nprocedure and is considered better for more adequatestaining of tissue sections.3.Gomori methenamine silver (GMS)  staining can also be\\nemployed.4. Molecular methods  by PCR.\\n5. IgM antibodies to PGL-1 antigen  seen in 95% cases of\\nlepromatous leprosy but only in 60% cases of tuberculoid\\nleprosy.\\n158SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nThe slit smear technique gives a reasonable quantitative\\nmeasure of M. leprae  when stained with Ziehl-Neelsen\\nmethod and examined under 100x oil objective for\\ndetermining the density of bacteria in the lesion (bacterial\\nindex, BI) . B.I. is scored from 1+ to 6+ (range from 1 to 10\\nbacilli per 100 fields to > 1000 per field) as multibacillary\\nleprosy while B.I. of 0+ is termed paucibacillary .\\nAlthough lepra bacilli were the first bacteria identified\\nfor causing human disease, M. leprae  remains one of the few\\nbacterial species which is yet to be cultured on artificialmedium. Nine-banded armadillo, a rodent, acts as an experi-mental animal model as it develops leprosy which ishistopathologically and immunologically similar to humanleprosy.\\nIncidence\\nThe disease is endemic in areas with hot and moist climates\\nand in poor tropical countries. According to the WHO,8 countries—India, China, Nepal, Brazil, Indonesia,Myanmar (Burma), Madagascar and Nigeria, togetherconstitute about 80% of leprosy cases, of which Indiaaccounts for one-third of all registered leprosy cases globally.In India, the disease is seen more commonly in regions likeTamil Nadu, Bihar, Pondicherry, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa,West Bengal and Assam. Very few cases are now seen inEurope and the United States.\\nMode of Transmission\\nLeprosy is a slow communicable disease and the incubation\\nperiod between first exposure and appearance of signs ofdisease varies from 2 to 20 years (average about 3 years).The infectivity may be from the following sources:\\n1.Direct contact  with untreated leprosy patients who shed\\nnumerous bacilli from damaged skin, nasal secretions,\\nmucous membrane of mouth and hair follicles.\\n2.Materno-foetal transmission  across the placenta.\\n3.Transmission from milk of leprosy patient to infant.\\nImmunology of Leprosy\\nLike in tuberculosis, the immune response in leprosy is also\\nT cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity (type IV reaction)but the two diseases are quite dissimilar as regards immunereactions and lesions. M. leprae  do not produce any toxins\\nbut instead the damage to tissues is immune-mediated. Thisis due to following peculiar aspects in immunology ofleprosy:\\n1. Antigens of leprosy bacilli.  Lepra bacilli have several\\nantigens. The bacterial cell wall contains large amount of M.\\nleprae -specific phenolic glycolipid (PGL-1) and another\\nsurface antigen, lipo-arabinomannan (LAMN). These\\nantigens of the bacilli determine the immune reaction of hostlymphocytes and macrophages. Another unique feature ofleprosy bacilli is invasion in peripheral nerves which is dueto binding of trisaccharide of M. leprae  to basal lamina of\\nSchwann cells.\\n2. Genotype of the host.  Genetic composition of the host as\\nknown by MHC class (or HLA type) determines which\\nFigure 6.31 Lepra bacilli in LL seen in Fite-Faraco stain as globi\\nand cigarettes-in-a-pack appearance inside the foam macrophages.Figure 6.30 Miliary tubercles in lung  having minute central caseation necrosis.\\n159CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healingantigen of leprosy bacilli shall interact with host immune\\ncells. Accordingly, the host response to the leprosy bacilli indifferent individuals is variable.\\n3. T cell response . There is variation in T cell response in\\ndifferent individuals infected with leprosy bacilli:\\ni) Unlike tubercle bacilli, there is not only activation  of CD4+\\nT cells but also of CD8+ T cells.ii) CD4+ T cells in lepra bacilli infected persons act not onlyas helper and promoter cells but also assume the role ofcytotoxicity .\\niii) The two subpopulations of CD4+ T cells (or T helpercells)—T\\nH 1 cells and TH 2 cells, elaborate different types of\\ncytokines  in response to stimuli from the lepra bacilli and\\nmacrophages.iv) In tuberculoid leprosy, the response is largely by CD4+ Tcells, while in lepromatous leprosy although there is excessof CD8+ T cells (suppressor T) but the macrophages andsuppressor T cells fail to destroy the bacilli due to CD8+ T\\ncell defect .\\n4. Humoral response . Though the patients of lepromatous\\nleprosy have humoral components like high levels ofimmunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) and antibodies tomycobacterial antigens but these antibodies do not have anyprotective role against  lepra bacilli.\\nBased  on above unique immunologic features in leprosy,\\nlesions in leprosy are classified into 5 distinct clinico-pathologic types and three forms of reactional leprosy whichare described below), and an intradermal immunologic test,lepromin test.\\nLEPROMIN TEST. It is not a diagnostic test but is used for\\nclassifying leprosy on the basis of immune response. Intra-\\ndermal injection of lepromin, an antigenic extract of M. leprae,\\nreveals delayed hypersensitivity reaction in patients oftuberculoid leprosy:\\nAn early positive reaction appearing as an indurated area\\nin 24-48 hours is called Fernandez reaction.\\nA delayed granulomatous lesion appearing after 3-4\\nweeks is called Mitsuda reaction .\\nPatients of lepromatous leprosy are negative by the\\nlepromin test.The test indicates that cell-mediated immunity is greatly\\nsuppressed in lepromatous leprosy while patients oftuberculoid leprosy show good immune response. Delayedtype of hypersensitivity is conferred by T helper cells. Thegranulomas of tuberculoid leprosy have sufficient T helpercells and fewer T suppressor cells at the periphery while thecellular infiltrates of lepromatous leprosy lack T helper cells.\\nClassification\\nLeprosy is broadly classified into 2 main types:\\nLepromatous type representing low resistance ; and\\nTuberculoid type representing high resistance .\\nSalient differences between the two main forms of lep-\\nrosy are summarised in Table 6.5 .\\nSince both these types of leprosy represent two opposite\\npoles of host immune response, these are also called polar\\nforms  of leprosy. Cases not falling into either of the two poles\\nare classified as borderline  and indeterminate types .\\nLeprosy is classified into 5 clinico-pathologic groups\\n(modified Ridley and Jopling’s classification) as under:\\nTT—Tuberculoid Polar (High resistance)\\nBT—Borderline Tuberculoid\\nBB—Mid Borderline (dimorphic)BL—Borderline LepromatousLL—Lepromatous Polar (Low resistance)\\nIn addition, not included in Ridley-Jopling’s classifica-\\ntion are cases of indeterminate leprosy, pure neural leprosy,and histoid leprosy resembling a nodule of dermatofibromaand positive for lepra bacilli.\\nReactional Leprosy\\nThere may be two types of lepra reactions: type I (reversal\\nreactions), and type II (erythema nodosum leprosum).\\nTYPE I: REVERSAL REACTIONS.  The polar forms of\\nleprosy do not undergo any change in clinical and histo-\\npathological picture. The borderline groups are unstable andmay move across the spectrum in either direction withupgrading or downgrading of patient’s immune state.Accordingly, there may be two types of borderline reaction:\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 6.5: Differences between Lepromatous and Tuberculoid Leprosy.\\nFeature Lepromatous Leprosy Tuberculoid Leprosy\\n1.

Upgrading reaction  is characterised by increased cell-\\nmediated immunity and occurs in patients of borderline\\nlepromatous (BL) type on treatment who upgrade or shifttowards tuberculoid type.\\nHistologically,  the upgrading reaction shows an increase\\nof lymphocytes, oedema of the lesions, necrosis in thecentre and reduced B.I.\\n2. Downgrading reaction  is characterised by lowering of\\ncellular immunity and is seen in borderline tuberculoid (BT)type who downgrade or shift towards lepromatous type.\\nHistologically,  the lesions show dispersal and spread of\\nthe granulomas and increased presence of lepra bacilli.\\nTYPE II: ERYTHEMA NODOSUM LEPROSUM (ENL).ENL occurs in lepromatous patients after treatment. It ischaracterised by tender cutaneous nodules, fever,iridocyclitis, synovitis and lymph node involvement.\\nHistologically,  the lesions in ENL show infiltration by\\nneutrophils and eosinophils and prominence of vasculitis.Inflammation often extends deep into the subcutaneousfat causing panniculitis. Bacillary load is increased.Secondary amyloidosis may follow repeated attacks ofENL in leprosy.\\nHistopathology of Leprosy\\nUsually, skin biopsy from the margin of lesions is submitted\\nfor diagnosis and for classification of leprosy. Thehistopathologic diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy like LLand BL offers no problem while the indeterminate leprosyand tuberculoid lesions are paucibacillary and their diagnosisis made together with clinical evidence.\\nIn general, for histopathologic evaluation in all suspectedcases of leprosy the following broad guidelines  should be\\nfollowed:\\ncell type of granuloma;\\nnerve involvement; and\\nbacterial load.The main features in various groups are given below.\\n1. Lepromatous leprosy:\\nThe following features characterise lepromatous polar\\nleprosy (Fig. 6.32):\\ni) In the dermis, there is proliferation of macrophages\\nwith foamy change, particularly around the blood vessels,nerves and dermal appendages. The foamy macrophages\\nare called ‘lepra cells’ or Virchow cells .\\nii) The lepra cells are heavily laden with acid-fast bacilli\\ndemonstrated with AFB staining. The AFB may be seen\\nas compact globular masses (globi)  or arranged in parallel\\nfashion like ‘cigarettes-in-pack’  (see Fig. 6.31).\\niii) The dermal infiltrate of lepra cells characteristicallydoes not encroach upon the basal layer of epidermis and\\nis separated from epidermis by a subepidermal\\nuninvolved clear zone .\\niv\\n) The epidermis  overlying the lesions is thinned out, flat\\nand may even ulcerate.\\n2. Tuberculoid leprosy:\\nThe polar tuberculoid form presents the following\\nhistological features (Fig. 6.33):\\ni) The dermal lesions show granulomas resembling hard\\ntubercles  composed of epithelioid cells, Langhans’ giant\\ncells and peripheral mantle of lymphocytes.\\nii) Lesions of tuberculoid leprosy have predilection for\\ndermal nerves  which may be destroyed and infiltrated by\\nepithelioid cells and lymphocytes.\\niii) The granulomatous infiltrate erodes the basal layer of\\nepidermis i.e. there is no clear zone .\\niv)The lepra bacilli  are few and seen in destroyed nerves.\\n3.\\nBorderline leprosy:\\nThe histopathologic features of the three forms ofborderline leprosy are as under:\\ni)Borderline tuberculoid (BT)  form shows epithelioid cells\\nand plentiful lymphocytes. There is a narrow clear\\nsubepidermal zone. Lepra bacilli are scanty and found innerves.\\nFigure 6.32 Lepromatous leprosy (LL). There is collection of proliferating foam macrophages (lepra cells) in the dermis with a clear subepi dermal\\nzone.\\n161CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\nii)Borderline lepromatous (BL)  form shows predominance\\nof histiocytes, a few epithelioid cells and some irregularly\\ndispersed lymphocytes. Numerous lepra bacilli are seen.\\niii)Mid-borderline (BB)  or dimorphic form shows sheets\\nof epithelioid cells with no giant cells. Some lymphocytes\\nare seen in the peri-neurium. Lepra bacilli are present,mostly in nerves.\\n4. Indeterminate leprosy:\\nThe histopathologic features are non-specific so that thediagnosis of non-specific chronic dermatitis may be made.However, a few features help in suspecting leprosy asunder:\\ni) Lymphocytic or mononuclear cell infiltrate, focalised\\nparticularly around skin adnexal structures like hairfollicles and sweat glands or around blood vessels.\\nii) Nerve involvement, if present, is strongly supportive\\nof diagnosis.\\niii) Confirmation of diagnosis is made by finding of lepra\\nbacilli.\\nClinical Features\\nThe two main forms of leprosy show distinctive clinical\\nfeatures:\\n1. Lepromatous leprosy:\\ni) The skin lesions in LL are generally symmetrical,\\nmultiple, slightly hypopigmented and erythematousmacules, papules, nodules or diffuse infiltrates. The nodularlesions may coalesce to give leonine facies  appearance.\\nii) The lesions are hypoaesthetic or anaesthetic but the\\nsensory disturbance is not as distinct as in TT.\\n2. Tuberculoid leprosy:\\ni)The skin lesions in TT occur as either single or as a few\\nasymmetrical lesions which are hypopigmented and\\nerythematous macules.\\nii\\n) There is a distinct sensory impairment.Anti-leprosy vaccines have been developed and are\\nundergoing human trials but since the incubation period of\\nleprosy is quite long, the efficacy of such vaccines will beknown after a number of years.\\nSYPHILIS\\nSyphilis is a venereal (sexually-transmitted) disease caused\\nby spirochaetes, Treponema pallidum . Other treponemal\\ndiseases are yaws, pinta and bejel. The word ‘syphilis’ isderived from the name of the mythological handsome boy,Syphilus, who was cursed by Greek god Apollo with thedisease.\\nCausative Organism\\nT. pallidum  is a coiled spiral filament 10 μm long that moves\\nactively in fresh preparations. The organism cannot be\\nstained by the usual methods and can be demonstrated inthe exudates and tissues by:1.dark ground illumination (DGI)  in fresh preparation;\\n2.fluorescent antibody technique ;\\n3.silver impregnation techniques ; and\\n4. PCR  as a research method.\\nThe organism has not been cultivated in any culture\\nmedia but experimental infection can be produced in rabbitsand chimpanzees. The organism is rapidly destroyed by cold,heat, and antiseptics.\\nImmunology\\nT. pallidum  does not produce any endotoxin or exotoxin. The\\npathogenesis of the lesions appears to be due to host immune\\nresponse.\\nThere are two types of serological tests for syphilis:\\ntreponemal and non-treponemal.\\nA. Treponemal serological tests:  These tests measure\\nantibody to T. pallidum  antigen and are as under:\\ni)Fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorbed (FTA-ABS) test.Figure 6.33 Tuberculoid leprosy (TT). Granuloma eroding the basal layer of the epidermis. The granuloma is composed of epithelioid cells wi th\\nsparse Langhans’ giant cells and lymphocytes.\\n162SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nii) Agglutinin assays  e.g. microhaemagglutination assay for\\nT. pallidum (MHA-TP), and Serodia TP-PA which is more\\nsensitive.\\niii) T. pallidum passive haemagglutination (TPHA) test .\\nB. Non-treponemal serological tests.  These tests measure\\nnon-specific reaginic antibodies IgM and IgG immuno-\\nglobulins directed against cardiolipin-lecithin-cholesterolcomplex and are more commonly used. These tests are asunder:\\ni) Reiter protein complement fixation (RPCF) test : test of choice\\nfor rapid diagnosis.\\nii)Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test :\\nWassermann described a complement fixing antibodyagainst antigen of human syphilitic tissue. This antigen isused in the Standard Test for Syphilis (STS) in Wassermanncomplement fixing test and Venereal Disease ResearchLaboratory (VDRL) test.\\nMode of Transmission\\nSyphilitic infection can be transmitted by the following\\nroutes:\\n1.Sexual intercourse  resulting in lesions on glans penis,\\nvulva, vagina and cervix.2.Intimate person-to-person contact  with lesions on lips,\\ntongue or fingers.\\n3.Transfusion  of infected blood.\\n4.Materno-foetal transmission  in congenital syphilis if the\\nmother is infected.\\nStages of Acquired Syphilis\\nAcquired syphilis is divided into 3 stages depending upon\\nthe period after which the lesions appear and the type oflesions. These are: primary, secondary and tertiary syphilis.1. PRIMARY SYPHILIS.  Typical lesion of primary syphilis\\nis chancre  which appears on genitals or at extra-genital sites\\nin 2-4 weeks  after exposure to infection (Fig. 6.34,A).  Initially,\\nthe lesion is a painless papule which ulcerates in the centreso that the fully-developed chancre is an indurated lesionwith central ulceration accompanied by regionallymphadenitis. The chancre heals without scarring, even inthe absence of treatment.\\nHistologically,  the chancre has following features:\\ni) Dense infiltrate of mainly plasma cells, some\\nlymphocytes and a few macrophages.ii) Perivascular aggregation of mononuclear cells, parti-\\ncularly plasma cells (periarteritis and endarteritis).iii)  Proliferation of vascular endothelium.\\nAntibody  tests are positive in 1-3 weeks after the appear-\\nance of chancre. Spirochaetes can be demonstrated in theexudates by DGI.\\n2.\\nSECONDARY SYPHILIS.  Inadequately treated patients\\nof primary syphilis develop mucocutaneous lesions  and\\npainless lymphadenopathy in 2-3 months  after the exposure\\n(Fig. 6.34,B). Mucocutaneous lesions may be in the form of\\nthe mucous patches on mouth, pharynx and vagina; and\\ngeneralised skin eruptions and condyloma lata in anogenitalregion.\\nAntibody tests are always positive at this stage.\\nSecondary syphilis is highly infective stage  and spirochaetes\\ncan be easily demonstrated in the mucocutaneous lesions.\\n3. TERTIARY SYPHILIS.  After a latent period of appear-\\nance of secondary lesions and about 2-3 years  following first\\nexposure, tertiary lesions of syphilis appear. Lesions of\\ntertiary syphilis are much less infective than the other twostages and spirochaetes can be demonstrated with greatdifficulty. These lesions are of 2 main types (Fig. 6.34,C):Figure 6.34 Organ involvement in various stages of acquired syphilis.\\nA, Primary syphilis : Primary lesion is ‘chancre’ on glans penis. B, Secondary syphilis:  Mucocutaneous lesions—mucous patches on oral and vaginal\\nmucosa and generalised skin eruptions. C, Tertiary syphilis:  Localised lesion as gumma of liver with scarring (hepar lobatum); diffuse lesions (right)\\nin aorta (aneurysm, narrowing of mouths of coronary ostia and incompetence of aortic valve ring) and nervous system.\\n163CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\ni) Syphilitic gumma.  It is a solitary, localised, rubbery\\nlesion with central necrosis, seen in organs like liver, testis,\\nbone and brain. In liver, the gumma is associated withscarring of hepatic parenchyma (hepar lobatum) .\\nHistologically, the structure of gumma shows thefollowing features  (Fig. 6.35):\\na) Central coagulative necrosis resembling caseation butis less destructive so that outlines of necrosed cells canstill be faintly seen.b) Surrounding zone of palisaded macrophages with\\nmany plasma cells, some lymphocytes, giant cells andfibroblasts.\\nii)\\nDiffuse lesions of tertiary syphilis.  The lesions appear\\nfollowing widespread dissemination of spirochaetes in thebody. The diffuse lesions are predominantly seen incardiovascular and nervous systems which are described indetail later in the relevant chapters. Briefly, these lesions areas under:\\na)Cardiovascular syphilis mainly involves thoracic aorta. The\\nwall of aorta is weakened and dilated due to syphilitic aortitis\\nand results in aortic aneurysm, incompetence of aortic valveand narrowing of mouths of coronary ostia (Chapter 15).\\nb)Neurosyphilis  may manifest as:\\nmeningovascular syphilis affecting chiefly the meninges;\\ntabes dorsalis affecting the spinal cord; and\\ngeneral paresis affecting the brain.\\nCONGENITAL SYPHILIS.  Congenital syphilis may develop\\nin a foetus of more than 16 weeks gestation who is exposed\\nto maternal spirochaetaemia. The major morphologic featuresas under:i)Saddle-shaped nose deformity due to destruction of bridge\\nof the nose.ii) The characteristic ‘Hutchinson’s teeth’ which are small,widely spaced, peg-shaped permanent teeth.iii)Mucocutaneous lesions of acquired secondary syphilis.\\niv) Bony lesions like epiphysitis and periostitis.v)\\nInterstitial keratitis with corneal opacity.\\nvi) Diffuse fibrosis in the liver.vii)Interstitial fibrosis of lungs.viii) If the foetus with congenital syphilis is born dead, it ispremature, with macerated skin, enlarged spleen and liver,and with syphilitic epiphysitis.\\nHistologically,  the basic morphology of lesions in syphilis\\nis seen in all the affected organs: perivascular plasma cellrich inflammatory infiltrate and endothelial cellproliferation. Many spirochaetes can be demonstrated ininvolved tissues.\\nACTINOMYCOSIS\\nActinomycosis is a chronic suppurative disease caused by\\nanaerobic bacteria, Actinomycetes israelii . The disease is\\nconventionally included in mycology though the causativeorganism is filamentous bacteria and not true fungus. Thedisease is worldwide in distribution. The organisms arecommensals in the oral cavity, alimentary tract and vagina.The infection is always endogeneous in origin and not byperson-to-person contact. The organisms invade, proliferateand disseminate in favourable conditions like break inmucocutaneous continuity, some underlying disease etc.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Depending upon the\\nanatomic location of lesions, actinomycosis is of 4 types:cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic (Fig. 6.36).\\n1. Cervicofacial actinomycosis.  This is the commonest\\nform (60%) and has the best prognosis. The infection entersfrom tonsils, carious teeth, periodontal disease or traumafollowing tooth extraction. Initially, a firm swellingdevelops in the lower jaw (‘lumpy jaw’). In time, the massbreaks down and abscesses and sinuses are formed. Thedischarging pus contains typical tiny yellow sulphurFigure 6.35 Typical microscopic appearance in the case of syphilitic\\ngumma of the liver. Central coagulative necrosis is surrounded by\\npalisades of macrophages and plasma cells marginated peripherally byfibroblasts.\\nFigure 6.36\\nActinomycosis, sites and routes of infection.\\n164SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\ngranules. The infection may extend into adjoining soft\\ntissues as well as may destroy the bone.\\n2. Thoracic actinomycosis.  The infection in the lungs is\\ndue to aspiration of the organism from oral cavity or\\nextension of infection from abdominal or hepatic lesions.Initially, the disease resembles pneumonia but\\nsubsequently the infection spreads to the whole of lung,\\npleura, ribs and vertebrae.\\n3. Abdominal actinomycosis.  This type is common in\\nappendix, caecum and liver. The abdominal infection\\nresults from swallowing of organisms from oral cavity or\\nextension from thoracic cavity.\\n4. Pelvic actinomycosis.  Infection in the pelvis occurs\\nas a complication of intrauterine contraceptive devices\\n(IUCD’s).\\nMicroscopically,  irrespective of the location of actino-\\nmycosis, the following features are seen (Fig. 6.37):\\ni) The inflammatory reaction is a granuloma with central\\nsuppuration. There is formation of abscesses in the centre\\nof lesions and at the periphery chronic inflammatory cells,\\ngiant cells and fibroblasts are seen.\\nii) The centre of each abscess contains the bacterial\\ncolony, ‘sulphur granule’, characterised by radiatingfilaments (hence previously known as ray fungus ) with\\nhyaline, eosinophilic, club-like ends representative ofsecreted immunoglobulins.\\niii)Bacterial stains reveal the organisms as gram-positive\\nfilaments, nonacid-fast, which stain positively with\\nGomori’s methen\\namine silver (GMS) staining.\\nSARCOIDOSIS (BOECK’S SARCOID)\\nSarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology. It is\\nworldwide in distribution and affects adults from 20-40 yearsof age. The disease is characterised by the presence of non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas (‘sarcoid granuloma’)in the affected tissues and organs, notably lymph nodes andlungs. Other sites are the skin, spleen, uvea of the eyes,salivary glands, liver and bones of hands and feet. Thehistologic diagnosis is generally made by exclusion.ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS.  The cause of\\nsarcoidosis remains unknown. Currently, possible etiology\\nis an infectious or noninfectious environmental agent in a\\ngenetically susceptible individual. Likely infectious agents\\ninclude Propionibacter acnes , atypical mycobacteria and\\nmycobacterial protein of M. tuberculosis . Since the disease is\\ncharacterised by granulomatous tissue reaction, possibility\\nof cell-mediated immune mechanisms has been suggested.\\nThe following observations point towards a possible immuneorigin of sarcoidosis:\\n1. Just as in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis is characterised by\\ndistinctive granulomatous response against poorly degradable\\nantigen , but quite unlike tuberculosis, the antigen in\\nsarcoidosis has eluded workers so far. PCR studies onaffected pulmonary tissue have given equivocal result asregards presence of mycobacterial antigen.\\n2. There are immunologic abnormalities in sarcoidosis is\\nsubstantiated by high levels of  CD4+T cells lavaged from lung\\nlesions. There is also elevation in levels of IL-2 receptors inserum and in lavaged fluid from lungs.\\n3. There is presence of activated alveolar macrophages which\\nelaborate cytokines that initiate the formation of non-\\ncaseating granulomas.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The lesions in sarcoidosis\\nare generalised and may affect various organs and tissuesat sometime in the course of disease, but brunt of thedisease is borne by the lungs and lymph nodes  (Fig. 6.38).\\nMicroscopically,  the following features are present\\n(Fig. 6.39):1.The diagnostic feature in sarcoidosis of any organ or\\ntissue is the non-caseating sarcoid granuloma, composed of\\nepithelioid cells, Langhans’ and foreign body giant cellsand surrounded peripherally by fibroblasts.2.Typically, granulomas of sarcoidosis are ‘naked’  i.e.\\neither devoid of peripheral rim of lymphocytes or there ispaucity of lymphocytes.3\\n. In late stage, the granuloma is either enclosed by\\nhyalinised fibrous tissue or is replaced by hyalinised fibrous\\nmass.Figure 6.37 Actinomycosis. Microscopic appearance of sulphur granule lying inside an abscess. The margin of the colony shows hyaline\\nfilaments highlighted by Masson’s trichrome stain (right photomicrograph).\\n165CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and HealingHEALING\\nHealing  is the body response to injury in an attempt to restore\\nnormal structure and function. Healing involves 2 distinct\\nprocesses:\\nRegeneration  when healing takes place by proliferation of\\nparenchymal cells and usually results in complete restorationof the original tissues.\\nRepair  when healing takes place by proliferation of\\nconnective tissue elements resulting in fibrosis and scarring.\\nAt times, both the processes take place simultaneously.\\nREGENERATION\\nSome parenchymal cells are short-lived while others have a\\nlonger lifespan. In order to maintain proper structure oftissues, these cells are under the constant regulatory controlof their cell cycle. These include growth factors such as:epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, endothelial growth factor,transforming growth factor- β.\\nCell cycle  (page 26) is defined as the period between two\\nsuccessive cell divisions and is divided into 4 unequal phases(Fig. 6.40):\\nM (mitosis) phase:  Phase of mitosis.\\nG1 (gap 1) phase:  The daughter cell enters G1 phase after\\nmitosis.\\nS (synthesis) phase:  During this phase, the synthesis of\\nnuclear DNA takes place.\\nG2 (gap 2) phase:  After completion of nuclear DNA\\nduplication, the cell enters G2 phase.\\nG0 (gap 0) phase:  This is the quiescent or resting phase of\\nthe cell after an M phase.\\nNot all cells of the body divide at the same pace. Some\\nmature cells do not divide at all while others complete a cellcycle every 16-24 hours. The main difference between slowly-dividing and rapidly-dividing cells is the duration of G\\n1\\nphase.Figure 6.38 Common location of lesions in sarcoidosis. The lesions\\nare predominantly seen in lymph nodes and throughout lung parenchyma.\\nFigure 6.39 Sarcoidosis in lymph node. Characteristically, there are non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas which have paucity of lympho -\\ncytes. A giant cell with inclusions is also seen in the photomicrograph (arrow).4. The giant cells in sarcoid granulomas contain certain\\ncytoplasmic inclusions as follows:\\ni)Asteroid bodies  which are eosinophilic and stellate-\\nshaped structures.\\nii)Schaumann’s bodies or conchoid (conch like) bodies  which\\nare concentric laminations of calcium and of iron salts,complexed with proteins.\\niii)Birefringent cytoplasmic crystals  which are colourless.\\nSimilar types of inclusions are also observed in chronicberylliosis (Chapter 17).\\nKVIEM’S TEST.  It is a useful intradermal diagnostic test.\\nThe antigen prepared from involved lymph node or spleenis injected intradermally. In a positive test, nodular lesionappears in 3-6 weeks at the inoculation site which onmicroscopic examination shows presence of non-caseatinggranulomas.\\n166SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nDepending upon their capacity to divide, the cells of the\\nbody can be divided into 3 groups: labile cells, stable cells,\\nand permanent cells.\\n1. Labile cells.  These cells continue to multiply throughout\\nlife under normal physiologic conditions. These include:\\nsurface epithelial cells of the epidermis, alimentary tract,respiratory tract, urinary tract, vagina, cervix, uterineendometrium, haematopoietic cells of bone marrow and cellsof lymph nodes and spleen.\\n2. Stable cells.  These cells decrease or lose their ability to\\nproliferate after adolescence but retain the capacity to\\nmultiply in response to stimuli throughout adult life. Theseinclude: parenchymal cells of organs like liver, pancreas,kidneys, adrenal and thyroid; mesenchymal cells like smoothmuscle cells, fibroblasts, vascular endothelium, bone andcartilage cells.\\n3. Permanent cells.  These cells lose their ability to proli-\\nferate around the time of birth. These include: neurons of\\nnervous system, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle cells.\\nRELATIONSHIP OF PARENCHYMAL CELLS WITH\\nCELL CYCLE.  If the three types of parenchymal cells des-\\ncribed above are correlated with the phase of cell cycle,following inferences can be derived:\\n1.Labile cells which are continuously dividing cells remain\\nin the cell cycle from one mitosis to the next.\\n2. Stable cells are in the resting phase (G\\n0) but can be stimu-\\nlated to enter the cell cycle.\\n3. Permanent cells are non-dividing cells which have left\\nthe cell cycle and die after injury.\\nRegeneration of any type of parenchymal cells involves\\nthe following 2 processes:i) Proliferation of original cells from the margin of injury\\nwith migration so as to cover the gap.ii) Proliferation of migrated cells with subsequentdifferentiation and maturation so as to reconstitute the\\noriginal tissue.\\nREPAIR\\nRepair is the replacement of injured tissue by fibrous tissue.\\nTwo processes are involved in repair:\\n1. Granulation tissue formation; and2. Contraction of wounds.\\nRepair response takes place by participation of\\nmesenchymal cells (consisting of connective tissue stem cells,fibrocytes and histiocytes), endothelial cells, macrophages,platelets, and the parenchymal cells of the injured organ.\\nGranulation Tissue Formation\\nThe term granulation tissue derives its name from slightly\\ngranular and pink appearance of the tissue. Each granulecorresponds histologically to proliferation of new small blood\\nvessels which are slightly lifted on the surface by thin\\ncovering of fibroblasts and young collagen.\\nThe following 3 phases are observed in the formation of\\ngranulation tissue  (Fig. 6.41):\\n1. PHASE OF INFLAMMATION.  Following trauma, blood\\nclots at the site of injury. There is acute inflammatoryresponse with exudation of plasma, neutrophils and some\\nmonocytes within 24 hours.\\n2.PHASE OF CLEARANCE.  Combination of proteolytic\\nenzymes liberated from neutrophils, autolytic enzymes from\\ndead tissues\\n cells, and phagocytic activity of macrophages\\nclear off the necrotic tissue, debris and red blood cells.Figure 6.40 Parenchymal cells in relation to cell cycle (G0–Resting phase; G1, G2–Gaps; S–Synthesis phase; M–Mitosis phase). The inner\\ncircle shown with green line represents cell cycle for labile cells; circle shown with yellow-orange line represents cell cycle for stable cells; and the\\ncircle shown with red line represents cell cycle for permanent cells. Compare them with traffic signals—green stands for ‘go’ applies here to dividing\\nlabile cells; yellow-orange signal for ‘ready to go’  applies here to stable cells which can be stimulated to enter cell cycle; and red signal for ‘stop’ here\\nmeans non-dividing permanent cells.\\n167CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\n3. PHASE OF INGROWTH OF GRANULATION\\nTISSUE.  This phase consists of 2 main processes: angio-\\ngenesis or neovascularisation, and fibrogenesis.\\ni) Angiogenesis (neovascularisation).  Formation of new\\nblood vessels at the site of injury takes place by proliferation\\nof endothelial cells from the margins of severed blood vessels.Initially, the proliferated endothelial cells are solid buds butwithin a few hours develop a lumen and start carrying blood.The newly formed blood vessels are more leaky, accountingfor the oedematous appearance of new granulation tissue.Soon, these blood vessels differentiate into musculararterioles, thin-walled venules and true capillaries.\\nThe process of angiogenesis is stimulated with proteolytic\\ndestruction of basement membrane. Angiogenesis takes placeunder the influence of following factors:\\na) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) elaborated by\\nmesenchymal cells while its receptors are present in\\nendothelial cells only.\\nb)\\nPlatelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming\\ngrowth factor- β (TGF- β), basic fibroblast growth factor\\n(bFGF) and surface integrins are all associated withcellular proliferation.\\nii) Fibrogenesis.  The newly formed blood vessels are\\npresent in an amorphous ground substance or matrix. Thenew fibroblasts originate from fibrocytes as well as by mitoticdivision of fibroblasts. Some of these fibroblasts havecombination of morphologic and functional characteristicsof smooth muscle cells ( myofibroblasts ). Collagen fibrils begin\\nto appear by about 6th day. As maturation proceeds, moreand more of collagen is formed while the number of activefibroblasts and new blood vessels decreases. This results information of inactive looking scar known as cicatrisation .\\nContraction of Wounds\\nThe wound starts contracting after 2-3 days and the process\\nis completed by the 14th day. During this period, the woundis reduced by approximately 80% of its original size.Contracted wound results in rapid healing since lessersurface area of the injured tissue has to be replaced.In order to explain the mechanism of wound contraction,\\na number of factors have been proposed. These are as under:\\n1.Dehydration  as a result of removal of fluid by drying of\\nwound was first suggested but without being substantiated.\\n2.Contraction of collagen  was thought to be responsible for\\ncontraction but wound contraction proceeds at a stage when\\nthe collagen content of granulation tissue is very small.\\n3. Discovery of myofibroblasts  appearing in active\\ngranulation tissue has resolved the controversy surrounding\\nthe mechanism of wound contraction. These cells have\\nfeatures intermediate between those of fibroblasts andsmooth muscle cells. Their migration into the wound areaand their active contraction decreases the size of the defect.The evidences in support of this concept are bothmorphological as well as functional characteristics ofmodified fibroblasts or myofibroblasts as under:\\ni) Fibrils present in the cytoplasm of these cells resemble\\nthose seen in smooth muscle cells.\\nii\\n) These cells contain actin-myosin similar to that found in\\nnon-striated muscle cells.iii)Cytoplasm of these modified cells demonstrates\\nimmunofluorescent labelling with anti-smooth muscle\\nantibodies.\\niv) Nuclei of these cells have infoldings of nuclear membrane\\nlike in smooth muscle cells.\\nv) These cells have basement membrane and desmosomes\\nwhich are not seen in ordinary fibroblasts.\\nvi) Drug response of granulation tissue is similar to that of\\nsmooth muscle.\\nWOUND HEALING\\nHealing of skin wounds provides a classical example of\\ncombination of regeneration and repair described above.Wound healing can be accomplished in one of the followingtwo ways:\\nHealing by first intention (primary union)\\nHealing by second intention (secondary union) .Figure 6.41 Active granulation tissue has inflammatory cell infiltrate, newly formed blood vessels and young fibrous tissue in loose matrix .\\n168SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nHealing by First Intention (Primary Union)\\nThis is defined as healing of a wound which has the following\\ncharacteristics:i) clean and uninfected;ii)\\nsurgically incised;\\niii) without much loss of cells and tissue; andiv) edges of wound are approximated by surgical sutures.\\nThe sequence of events in primary union is illustrated in\\nFig. 6.42  and described below:\\n1. Initial haemorrhage.  Immediately after injury, the space\\nbetween the approximated surfaces of incised wound is filledwith blood which then clots and seals the wound againstdehydration and infection.\\n2. Acute inflammatory response.  This occurs within 24\\nhours with appearance of polymorphs from the margins of\\nincision. By 3rd day, polymorphs are replaced bymacrophages.\\n3. Epithelial changes.  The basal cells of epidermis from both\\nthe cut margins start proliferating and migrating towards\\nincisional space in the form of epithelial spurs. A well-approximated wound is covered by a layer of epithelium in48 hours. The migrated epidermal cells separate theunderlying viable dermis from the overlying necroticmaterial and clot, forming scab which is cast off. The basal\\ncells from the margins continue to divide. By 5th day, amultilayered new epidermis is formed which is differentiatedinto superficial and deeper layers.\\n4. Organisation.  By 3rd day, fibroblasts also invade the\\nwound area. By 5th day, new collagen fibrils start forming\\nwhich dominate till healing is completed. In 4 weeks, thescar tissue with scanty cellular and vascular elements, a fewinflammatory cells and epithelialised surface is formed.\\n5. Suture tracks.  Each suture track is a separate wound and\\nincites the same phenomena as in healing of the primarywound  i.e. filling the space with haemorrhage, some\\ninflammatory cell reaction, epithelial cell proliferation along\\nthe suture track from both margins, fibroblastic proliferation\\nand formation of young collagen. When sutures are removed\\naround 7th day, much of epithelialised suture track is avulsedand the remaining epithelial tissue in the track is absorbed.However, sometimes the suture track gets infected (stitch\\nabscess) , or the epithelial cells may persist in the track (implan-\\ntation or epidermal cysts) .\\nThus, the scar formed in a sutured wound is neat due to\\nclose apposition of the margins of wound; the use of adhesivetapes avoids removal of stitches and its complications.\\nHealing by Second Intention (Secondary Union)\\nThis is defined as healing of a wound having the following\\ncharacteristics:\\ni) open with a large tissue defect, at times infected;\\nii)\\nhaving extensive loss of cells and tissues; and\\niii) the wound is not approximated by surgical sutures butis left open.\\nThe basic events in secondary union are similar to\\nprimary union but differ in having a larger tissue defect\\nwhich has to be bridged. Hence healing takes place from the\\nbase upwards as well as from the margins inwards. Thehealing by second intention is slow and results in a large, attimes ugly, scar as compared to rapid healing and neat scarof primary union.\\nThe sequence of events in secondary union is illustrated\\nin Fig. 6.43 and described below:\\n1. Initial haemorrhage.  As a result of injury, the wound\\nspace is filled with blood and fibrin clot which dries.\\n2. Inflammatory phase.  There is an initial acute inflam-\\nmatory response followed by appearance of macrophages\\nwhich clear off the debris as in primary union.\\n3. Epithelial changes.  As in primary healing, the epidermal\\ncells from both the margins of wound proliferate and migrateFigure 6.42 Primary union of skin wounds. A, The incised wound as well as suture track on either side are filled with blood clot and there is\\ninflammatory response from the margins. B, Spurs of epidermal cells migrate along the incised margin on either side as well as around the suture\\ntrack. Formation of granulation tissue also begins from below. C, Removal of suture at around 7th day results in scar tissue at the sites of incision\\nand suture track.\\n169CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing\\nFigure 6.43 Secondary union of skin wounds. A, The open wound is filled with blood clot and there is inflammatory response at the junction of\\nviable tissue. B, Epithelial spurs from the margins of wound meet in the middle to cover the gap and separate the underlying vi able tissue from\\nnecrotic tissue at the surface forming scab. C, After contraction of the wound, a scar smaller than the original wound is left.\\ninto the wound in the form of epithelial spurs till they meet\\nin the middle and re-epithelialise the gap completely.However, the proliferating epithelial cells do not cover thesurface fully until granulation tissue from base has startedfilling the wound space. In this way, pre-existing viableconnective tissue is separated from necrotic material and cloton the surface, forming scab which is cast off. In time, the\\nregenerated epidermis becomes stratified and keratinised.\\n4. Granulation tissue.  Main bulk of secondary healing is\\nby granulations. Granulation tissue is formed by proliferation\\nof fibroblasts and neovascularisation from the adjoiningviable elements. The newly-formed granulation tissue is deepred, granular and very fragile. With time, the scar onmaturation becomes pale and white due to increase incollagen and decrease in vascularity. Specialised structuresof the skin like hair follicles and sweat glands are not replacedunless their viable residues remain which may regenerate.\\n5. Wound contraction.  Contraction of wound is an\\nimportant feature of secondary healing, not seen in primary\\nhealing. Due to the action of myofibroblasts present ingranulation tissue, the wound contracts to one-third to one-fourth of its original size. Wound contraction occurs at a timewhen active granulation tissue is being formed.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 6.6: Differences between Primary and Secondary Union of Wounds.\\nFeature Primary Union Secondary Union\\n1. Cleanliness of wound Clean Unclean\\n2. Infection Generally \\nuninfected May be infected\\n3. Margins Surgical clean Irregular\\n4. Sutures Used Not used\\n5. Healing Scanty granulation tissue at the incised Exuberant granulation tissue\\ngap and along suture tracks to fill the gap\\n6. Outcome Neat linear scar Contracted irregular wound\\n7. Complications Infrequent, epidermal inclusion cyst formation Suppuration, may require debridement6. Presence of infection.  Bacterial contamination of an open\\nwound delays the process of healing due to release of\\nbacterial toxins that provoke necrosis, suppuration andthrombosis. Surgical removal of dead and necrosed tissue,debridement,  helps in preventing the bacterial infection of open\\nwounds.\\nDifferences between primary and secondary union of\\nwounds are given in Table 6.6.\\nComplications of W ound Healing\\nDuring the course of healing, following complications mayoccur:\\n1.Infection  of wound due to entry of bacteria delays the\\nhealing.\\n2.Implantation (epidermal) cyst  formation may occur due to\\npersistence of epithelial cells in the wound after healing.\\n3.Pigmentation.  Healed wounds may at times have rust-like\\ncolour due to staining with haemosiderin. Some coloured\\nparticulate material left in the wound may persist and impartcolour to the healed wound.\\n4.Deficient scar formation.  This may occur due to inadequate\\nformation of granulation tissue.\\n170SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques5.Incisional hernia.  A weak scar, especially after a\\nlaparotomy, may be the site of bursting open of a wound\\n(wound dehiscence) or an incisional hernia.\\n6.Hypertrophied scars and keloid formation.  At times the scar\\nformed is excessive, ugly and painful. Excessive formation\\nof collagen in healing may result in keloid (claw-like)\\nformation, seen more commonly in Blacks. Hypertrophiedscars differ from keloid in that they are confined to theborders of the initial wound while keloids have tumour-likeprojection of connective tissue.\\n7.Excessive contraction.  An exaggeration of wound\\ncontraction may result in formation of contractures or\\ncicatrisation e.g. Dupuytren’s (palmar) contracture, plantarcontracture and Peyronie’s disease (contraction of thecavernous tissues of penis).\\n8.Neoplasia.  Rarely, scar may be the site for development\\nof carcinoma later e.g. squamous cell carcinoma in Marjolin’s\\nulcer i.e. a scar following burns on the skin.\\nExtracellular Matrix— Wound Strength\\nThe wound is strengthened by proliferation of fibroblasts\\nand myofibroblasts which get structural support from theextracellular matrix (ECM). In addition to providingstructural support, ECM can direct cell migration,attachment, differentiation and organisation.\\nECM has five main components: collagen, adhesive\\nglycoproteins, basement membrane, elastic fibres, andproteoglycans.\\n1. COLLAGEN.  The collagens are a family of proteins\\nwhich provide structural support to the multicellular\\norganism. It is the main component of tissues such as fibroustissue, bone, cartilage, valves of heart, cornea, basementmembrane etc.\\nCollagen is synthesised and secreted by a complex\\nbiochemical mechanism on ribosomes. The collagen synthesisis stimulated by various growth factors and is degraded bycollagenase. Regulation of collagen synthesis anddegradation take place by various local and systemic factorsso that the collagen content of normal organs remainsconstant. On the other hand, defective regulation of collagensynthesis leads to hypertrophied scar, fibrosis, and organdysfunction.\\nDepending upon the biochemical composition, 18 types\\nof collagen have been identified called collagen type I to XVIII,\\nmany of which are unique for specific tissues. Type I collagenis normally present in the skin, bone and tendons andaccounts for 90% of collagen in the body:\\nType I, III and V are true fibrillar  collagen  which form the\\nmain portion of the connective tissue during healing ofwounds in scars.\\nOther types of collagen are non-fibrillar  and amorphous\\nmaterial seen as component of the basement membranes.\\nMorphologically, the smallest units of collagen are\\ncollagen fibrils , which align together in parallel bundles to\\nform collagen fibres , and then collagen bundles .\\n2. ADHESIVE GLYCOPROTEINS.  Various adhesive\\nglycoproteins acting as glue for the ECM and the cells consistof fibronectin, tenascin (cytotactin) and thrombospondin.i) Fibronectin  (nectere  = to bind) is the best characterised\\nglycoprotein in ECM and has binding properties to other cellsand ECM. It is of two types—plasma and tissue fibronectin.\\nPlasma fibronectin is synthesised by the liver cells and is\\ntrapped in basement membrane such as in filtration throughthe renal glomerulus.\\n Tissue fibronectin  is formed by fibroblasts, endothelial\\ncells and other mesenchymal cells. It is responsible for theprimitive matrix such as in the foetus, and in wound healing.\\nii) Tenascin or cytotactin  is the glycoprotein associated with\\nfibroblasts and appears in wound about 48 hours after injury.\\nIt disappears from mature scar tissue.\\niii) Thrombospondin  is mainly synthesised by granules of\\nplatelets. It functions as adhesive protein for keratinocytes\\nand platelets but is inhibitory to attachment of fibroblastsand endothelial cells.\\n3. BASEMENT MEMBRANE.  Basement membranes are\\nperiodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive amorphous structures\\nthat lie underneath epithelia of different organs andendothelial cells. They consist of collagen type IV andlaminin.\\n4. ELASTIC FIBRES.  While the tensile strength in tissue\\ncomes from collagen, the ability to recoil is provided by elastic\\nfibres. Elastic fibres consist of 2 components—elastinglycoprotein and elastic microfibril. Elastases degrade theelastic tissue e.g. in inflammation, emphysema etc.\\n5. PROTEOGLYCANS.  These are a group of molecules\\nhaving 2 components—an essential carbohydrate polymer\\n(called polysaccharide or glycosaminoglycan), and a proteinbound to it, and hence the name proteo-glycan. Variousproteoglycans are distributed in different tissues as under:i)Chondroitin sulphate —abundant in cartilage, dermis\\nii)Heparan sulphate —in basement membranes\\niii)Dermatan sulphate —in dermis\\niv)Keratan sulphate —in cartilage\\nv)Hyaluronic acid —in cartilage, dermis.\\nIn wound healing, the deposition of proteoglycans\\nprecedes collagen laying.\\nThe strength of wound also depends upon factors like\\nthe site of injury, depth of incision and area of wound. Afterremoval of stitches on around 7th day, the wound strengthis approximately 10% which reaches 80% in about 3 months.\\nTURNOVER OF ECM. ECM is not a static structure but\\nthe matrix proteins comprising it undergo marked\\nremodeling during foetal life which slows down in adulttissues. These matrix proteins are degraded by a family ofmetalloproteinases which act under regulatory control ofinhibitors of metalloproteinases.\\nFactors Influencing Healing\\nTwo types of factors influence the wound healing: those\\nacting locally, and those acting in general.\\nA. LOCAL FACTORS:\\n1.Infection  is the most important factor acting locally which\\ndelays the process of healing.171CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and Healing2.Poor blood supply  to wound slows healing e.g. injuries to\\nface heal quickly due to rich blood supply while injury to\\nleg with varicose ulcers having poor blood supply healsslowly.\\n3.Foreign bodies  including sutures interfere with healing and\\ncause intense inflammatory reaction and infection.\\n4.Movement  delays wound healing.\\n5. Exposure to ionising radiation  delays granulation tissue\\nformation.\\n6. Exposure to ultraviolet light  facilitates healing.\\n7.Type, size and location  of injury determines whether\\nhealing takes place by resolution or organisation.\\nB. SYSTEMIC FACTORS:\\n1.Age. Wound healing is rapid in young and somewhat\\nslow in aged and debilitated people due to poor blood supplyto the injured area in the latter.\\n2.Nutrition.  Deficiency of constituents like protein, vitamin\\nC (scurvy) and zinc delays the wound healing.3.Systemic infection  delays wound healing.\\n4.Administration of glucocorticoids  has anti-inflammatory\\neffect.5.Uncontrolled  diabetics  are more prone to develop infections\\nand hence delay in healing.6.Haematologic abnormalities  like defect of neutrophil func-\\ntions (chemotaxis and phagocytosis), and neutropenia and\\nbleeding disorders slow the process of wound healing.\\nHEALING IN SPECIALISED TISSUES\\nHealing of the skin wound provides an example of general\\nprocess of healing by regeneration and repair. However, incertain specialised tissues, either regeneration or repair maypredominate. Some of these examples are described below.Fracture Healing\\nHealing of fracture by callus formation depends upon some\\nclinical considerations whether the fracture is:\\ntraumatic  (in previously normal bone), or pathological  (in\\npreviously diseased bone);\\ncomplete or incomplete  like green-stick fracture; and\\nsimple  (closed), comminuted (splintering of bone), or\\ncompound  (communicating to skin surface).\\nHowever, basic events in healing of any type of fracture\\nare similar and resemble healing of skin wound to someextent.\\nPrimary union of fractures  occurs in a few special\\nsituations when the ends of fracture are approximated as is\\ndone by application of compression clamps. In these cases,\\nbony union takes place with formation of medullary calluswithout periosteal callus formation. The patient can be madeambulatory early but there is more extensive bone necrosis\\nand slow healing.\\nSecondary union  is the more common process of fracture\\nhealing. Though it is a continuous process, secondary bone\\nunion is described under the following 3 headings:i) Procallus formation\\nii) Osseous callus formation\\niii) Remodelling\\nThese processes are illustrated in Fig. 6.44 and described\\nbelow:\\nI. PROCALLUS FORMATION.  Steps involved in the\\nformation of procallus are as follows:\\n1. Haematoma  forms due to bleeding from torn blood\\nvessels, filling the area surrounding the fracture. Loose\\nmeshwork is formed by blood and fibrin clot which acts asframework for subsequent granulation tissue formation.\\n2. Local inflam\\nmatory response  occurs at the site of injury\\nwith exudation of fibrin, polymorphs and macrophages. The\\nFigure 6.44 Fracture healing. A, Haematoma formation and local inflammatory response at the fracture site. B, Ingrowth of granulation tissu e\\nwith formation of soft tissue callus. C, Formation of procallus composed of woven bone and cartilage with its characteristic fu siform appearance and\\nhaving 3 arbitrary components—external, intermediate and internal callus. D, Formation of osseous callus composed of lamellar b one following\\nclearance of woven bone and cartilage. E, Remodelled bone ends; the external callus cleared away. Intermediate callus converted  into lamellar\\nbone and internal callus developing bone marrow cavity.\\n172SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nmacrophages clear away the fibrin, red blood cells,\\ninflammatory exudate and debris. Fragments of necrosedbone are scavenged by macrophages and osteoclasts.\\n3. Ingrowth of granulation tissue  begins with neovascula-\\nrisation and proliferation of mesenchymal cells from\\nperiosteum and endosteum. A soft tissue callus is thusformed which joins the ends of fractured bone without muchstrength.\\n4. Callus composed of woven bone and cartilage  starts\\nwithin the first few days. The cells of inner layer of the\\nperiosteum have osteogenic potential and lay down collagenas well as osteoid matrix in the granulation tissue (Fig. 6.45) .\\nThe osteoid undergoes calcification and is called woven bone\\ncallus . A much wider zone over the cortex on either side of\\nfractured ends is covered by the woven bone callus andunited to bridge the gap between the ends, giving spindle-shaped or fusiform appearance to the union. In poorlyimmobilised fractures (e.g. fracture ribs), the subperiostealosteoblasts may form cartilage at the fracture site. At times,callus is composed of woven bone as well as cartilage, tempo-rarily immobilising the bone ends.\\nThis stage is called provisional callus or procallus\\nformation and is arbitrarily divided into external, intermediate\\nand internal procallus .\\nII. OSSEOUS CALLUS FORMATION.  The procallus acts\\nas scaffolding on which osseous callus composed of lamellarbone is formed. The woven bone is cleared away by incomingosteoclasts and the calcified cartilage disintegrates. In theirplace, newly-formed blood vessels and osteoblasts invade,laying down osteoid which is calcified and lamellar bone isformed by developing Haversian system concentricallyaround the blood vessels.\\nIII.  REMODELLING.  During the formation of lamellar\\nbone, osteoblastic laying and osteoclastic removal are taking\\nplace remodelling the united bone ends, which aftersometime, is indistinguishable from normal bone. Theexternal callus is cleared away, compact bone (cortex) isformed in place of intermediate callus and the bone marrowcavity develops in internal callus.\\nCOMPLICATIONS OF FRACTURE HEALING.  These are\\nas under:\\n1.Fibrous union  may result instead of osseous union if the\\nimmobilisation of fractured bone is not done. Occasionally,\\na false joint may develop at the fracture site (pseudo-arthrosis).\\n2. Non-union  may result if some soft tissue is interposed\\nbetween the fractured ends.\\n3.\\nDelayed union  may occur from causes of delayed wound\\nhealing in general such as infection, inadequate blood supply,\\npoor nutrition, movement and old age.\\nHealing of Nervous Tissue\\nCENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.  The nerve cells of the\\nbrain, spinal cord and ganglia once destroyed are not\\nreplaced. Axons of CNS also do not show any significantregeneration. The damaged neuroglial cells, however, mayshow proliferation of astrocytes called gliosis.\\nPERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.  In contrast to the cells\\nof CNS, the peripheral nerves show regeneration, mainly\\nfrom proliferation of Schwann cells and fibrils from distalend. The process is discussed in Chapter 30. Briefly, it consistsof the following:\\nMyelin sheath and axon of the intact distal nerve undergo\\nWallerian degeneration up to the next node of Ranviertowards the proximal end.\\nDegenerated debris are cleared away by macrophages.\\nRegeneration in the form of sprouting of fibrils takes place\\nfrom the viable end of axon. These fibrils grow along thetrack of degenerated nerve so that in about 6-7 weeks, theperipheral stump consists of tube filled with elongatedSchwann cells.\\nOne of the fibrils from the proximal stump enters the old\\nneural tube and develops into new functional axon.\\nHealing of Muscle\\nAll three types of muscle fibres have limited capacity to\\nregenerate.\\nSKELETAL MUSCLE. The regeneration of striated muscle\\nis similar to peripheral nerves. On injury, the cut ends of\\nmuscle fibres retract but are held together by stromalconnective tissue. The injured site is filled with fibrinousmaterial, polymorphs and macrophages. After clearance ofdamaged fibres by macrophages, one of the following twotypes of regeneration of muscle fibres can occur:\\nIf the muscle sheath is intact, sarcolemmal tubes\\ncontaining histiocytes appear along the endomysial tubewhich, in about 3 months time, restores properly orientedmuscle fibres e.g. in Zenker’s degeneration of muscle intyphoid fever.\\nIf the muscle sheath is damaged, it forms a disorganised\\nmultinucleate mass and scar composed of fibrovasculartissue e.g. in Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture.Figure 6.45 Callus formation in fracture healing.\\n173CHAPTER 6 Inflammation and HealingSMOOTH MUSCLE.  Non-striated muscle has limited\\nregenerative capacity e.g. appearance of smooth muscle in\\nthe arterioles in granulation tissue. However, in largedestructive lesions, the smooth muscle is replaced bypermanent scar tissue.\\nCARDIAC MUSCLE.  Destruction of heart muscle is replaced\\nby fibrous tissue. However, in situations where the\\nendomysium of individual cardiac fibre is intact (e.g. indiphtheria and coxsackie virus infections), regeneration ofcardiac fibres may occur in young patients.\\nHealing of Mucosal Surfaces\\nThe cells of mucosal surfaces have very good regeneration\\nand are normally being lost and replaced continuously e.g.mucosa of alimentary tract, respiratory tract, urinary tract,uterine endometrium etc. This occurs by proliferation frommargins, migration, multilayering and differentiation ofepithelial cells in the same way as in the epidermal cells inhealing of skin wounds.\\nHealing of Solid Epithelial Organs\\nFollowing gross tissue damage to organs like the kidney, liver\\nand thyroid, the replacement is by fibrous scar e.g. in chronicpyelonephritis and cirrhosis of liver. However, inparenchymal cell damage with intact basement membraneor intact supporting stromal tissue, regeneration may occur.For example:\\nIn tubular necrosis  of kidney with intact basement\\nmembrane, proliferation and slow migration of tubularepithelial cells may occur to form renal tubules.\\nIn viral hepatitis,  if part of the liver lobule is damaged with\\nintact stromal network, proliferation of hepatocytes mayresult in restoration of liver lobule.\\n❑174SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nChapter 7Infectious and\\nParasitic DiseasesChapter 7\\nINTRODUCTION\\nMicroorganisms, namely bacteria, viruses, fungi and\\nparasites, are present everywhere—in the soil, water, atmos-phere and on the body surfaces, and are responsible for alarge number of infectious diseases in human beings. Somemicroorganisms are distributed throughout the world whileothers are limited to certain geographic regions only. Ingeneral, tropical and developing countries are speciallyaffected by infectious diseases than the developed countries.There are several examples of certain infectious diseases  which\\nare not so common in the developed world now but theycontinue to be major health problems in the developingcountries e.g. tuberculosis, leprosy, typhoid fever, cholera,measles, pertussis, malaria, amoebiasis, pneumonia etc.Vaccines  have, however, been successful in controlling or\\neliminating some diseases all over the world e.g. smallpox,poliomyelitis, measles, pertussis etc. Similarly, insecticideshave helped in controlling malaria to an extent. However,infections still rank very high as a cause of death  in the world.\\nReasons for this trend are not difficult to seek:\\nDevelopment of newer and antibiotic-resistant strains of\\nmicroorganisms; classic example is that of methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus  (MRSA).\\nAdministration of immunosuppressive therapy to\\npatients with malignant tumours and transplanted organsmaking them susceptible to opportunistic infections\\nIncreasing number of patients reporting to hospital for\\ndifferent illnesses but instead many developing hospital-acquired infections.\\nLastly, discovery in 1981 of previously unknown deadly\\ndisease i.e. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\\nWhile talking of microbial infective diseases, let us not\\nforget the fact that many microorganisms may actually\\nbenefit mankind. Following is the range of host-organism inter-\\nrelationship,  which may vary quite widely:\\n1.Symbiosis i.e. cooperative association between two\\ndissimilar organisms beneficial to both.\\n2.Commensalism i.e. two dissimilar organisms living\\ntogether benefitting one without harming the other.3.True parasitism  i.e. two dissimilar organisms living\\ntogether benefitting the parasite but harming the host.4.Saprophytism  i.e. organisms living on dead tissues.\\nBesides microorganisms, more recently a modified host\\nprotein present in the mammalian CNS has been identified\\ncalled prion protein . Prions are transmissible agents similar\\nto infectious particles but lack nucleic acid. These agents are\\nimplicated in the etiology of spongiform encephalopathy,(including kuru), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (or madcow disease) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (associated withcorneal transplantation). (Dr. Prusiner who discovered prion\\nprotein was awarded Nobel Prize in medicine in 1997).\\nTransmission of infectious diseases requires a chain of\\nevents and is the consequence of inter-relationship between\\ndisease-producing properties of microorganisms and host-\\ndefense capability against the invading organisms. Briefly,\\nchain in transmission of infections and factors determiningthis host-microorganism relationship are given below:\\nChain in Transmission of Infectious Diseases\\nTransmission of infections occurs following a chain of events\\npertaining to various parameters as under:\\ni) Reservoir of pathogen.  Infection occurs from the source\\nof reservoir of pathogen. It may be a human being (e.g. in\\ninfluenza virus), animal (e.g. dog for rabies), insect (e.g.mosquito for malaria), or soil (e.g. enterobiasis).\\nii) Route of infection.  Infection is transmitted from the\\nreservoir to the human being by different routes, usually from\\nbreach in the mucosa or the skin at both— the portal of exitfrom the reservoir and the portal of entry in the susceptiblehost.  In general, the organism is transmitted to the site wherethe organism would normally flourish e.g. N. gonorrhoeae\\nusually inhabits the male and female urethra and, therefore,the route of transmission would be sexual contact.\\niii) Mode of transmission.  The organism may be transmitted\\ndirectly by physical contact or by faecal contamination (e.g.\\nspread of eggs in hookworm infestation), or indirectly byfomites (e.g. insect bite).\\niv) Susceptible host.  The organism would colonise the host\\nif the host has good immunity but such a host can pass on\\ninfection to others. However, if the host is old, debilitated,malnourished, or immunosuppressed due any etiology, heis susceptible to have manifestations of infection.\\nKey to management of infection lies in breaking or\\nblocking this chain for transmission and spread of infection.\\nFactors Relating to Infectious Agents\\nThese are as under:\\ni) Mode of entry.  Microorganisms causing infectious\\ndiseases may gain entry into the body by various routes e.g.\\nthrough ingestion (external route);\\ninoculation (parenteral method);\\ninhalation (respiration);\\nperinatally (vertical transmission);\\nby direct contact (contagious infection); and175CHAPTER 7 Infectious and Parasitic Diseasesby contaminated water, food, soil, environment or from\\nan animal host (zoonotic infections).\\nii) Spread of infection.  Microorganisms after entering the\\nbody may spread further through the phagocytic cells, blood\\nvessels and lymphatics.\\niii)Production of toxins.  Bacteria liberate toxins which have\\neffects on cell metabolism. Endotoxins  are liberated on lysis\\nof the bacterial cell while exotoxins  are secreted by bacteria\\nand have effects at distant sites too.iv) Virulence of organisms.  Many species and strains of\\norganisms may have varying virulence e.g. the three strains\\nof C. diphtheriae  (gravis, intermedius and mitis)  produce the\\nsame diphtherial exotoxin but in different amounts.\\nv) Product of organisms.  Some organisms produce enzy-\\nmes that help in spread of infections e.g. hyaluronidase by\\nCl. welchii , streptokinase by streptococci, staphylokinase and\\ncoagulase by staphylococci.\\nFactors Relating to Host\\nMicroorganisms invade human body when defenses are not\\nadequate. These factors include the following:\\ni) Physical barrier.  A break in the continuity of the skin\\nand mucous membranes allows the microorganisms to enter\\nthe body.\\nii) Chemical barrier.  Mucus secretions of the oral cavity and\\nthe alimentary tract and gastric acidity prevent bacterial\\ncolonisation.\\niii) Effective drainage.  Natural passages of the hollow organs\\nlike respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary and genital system\\nprovide a way to drain the excretions effectively. Similarly,ducts of various glands are the conduits of drainage ofsecretions. Obstruction in any of these passages promotesinfection.\\niv) Immune defense mechanisms.  These include the phago-\\ncytic leucocytes of blood (polymorphs and monocytes),\\nphagocytes of tissues (mononuclear-phagocyte system) andthe immune system as discussed in Chapter 4.\\nSome of the common diseases produced by pathogenic\\nmicroorganisms are discussed below. Each group ofmicroorganisms discussed here is accompanied by a Tablelisting diseases produced by them. These lists of diseasesare in no way complete but include only important andcommon examples. No attempts will be made to give detailsof organisms as that would mean repeating what is given inthe textbooks of Microbiology. Instead, salient clinico-pathologic aspects of these diseases are highlighted.\\nMethods of Identification\\nThe organisms causing infections and parasitic diseases may\\nbe identified by routine H & E stained sections in manyinstances. However, confirmation in most cases requireseither application of special staining techniques  or is\\nconfirmed by molecular biologic methods (Table 7.1) . In\\naddition, culture of lesional  tissue should be carried out forspecies identification and drug sensitivity. Generally, theorganism is looked for at the advancing edge of the lesion inthe section rather than in the necrotic centre (Fig. 7.1) .\\nDISEASES CAUSED BY BACTERIA,\\nSPIROCHAETES AND MYCOBACTERIA\\nIn order to gain an upper hand in human host, bacteria mustresist early engulfment by neutrophils. They survive anddamage the host in a variety of ways such as by generation\\nof toxins (e.g. gas-forming anaerobes), by forming a slippery\\ncapsule that resists attachment to macrophages (e.g.pneumococci), by inhibition of fusion of phagocytic vacuoleswith lysosomes (e.g. tubercle bacilli) etc.\\nTable 7.2  provides an abbreviated classification of\\nbacterial diseases and their etiologic agents. A few common\\nand important examples amongst these are discussed below.\\nPLAGUE\\nPlague is caused by Yersinia (Pasteurella) pestis  which is a\\nsmall Gram-negative coccobacillus that grows rapidly on\\nmost culture media. Direct identification of the organism intissues is possible by fluorescence antisera methods.\\nPlague has been a great killer since 14th century and is\\nknown to have wiped out populations of cities. However,the modern Europe is plague free, possibly due towidespread use of arsenic as rat poison. Currently, the worldover, Vietnam and Tanzania have most cases of plague.However, an outbreak in Surat in the state of Gujarat inWestern part of India in 1994 alarmed the world once againthat we are not totally free of this dreaded ‘black death’.\\nPlague is a zoonotic disease and spreads by rodents,\\nprimarily by rats, both wild and domestic; others beingsquirrels and rabbits. Humans are incidental hosts other thanrodents.\\nInfection to humans occurs by rat-flea or by inhalation.\\nAfter the organisms enter the bloodstream, they reach thedraining lymph nodes where, rather than being phago-cytosed by phagocytic cells, they proliferate rapidly giving\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 7.1: Methods of Identification of Microorganisms.\\n1.

This occurs within 24-48\\nhours of infection and is accompanied by chills, fever,myalgia, nausea, vomiting and marked prostration. Ifuntreated, death occurs from disseminated intravascularcoagulation (DIC) within 1 to 2 days with development ofwidespread petechiae and ecchymoses leading to gangrene,and hence the name black death.  In other cases, death results\\nfrom multi-organ failure due to profound toxaemia. Thepatient and his fluids are highly infectious and can be trans-mitted by arthropods as well as person-to-person contact,giving rise to secondary cases.\\nVirulence of the organism Y. pestis  is attributed to the\\nelaboration of plague toxins: pesticin and lipopolysaccharideendotoxin.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Following forms of plague\\nare recognised (Fig. 7.2):\\n1. Bubonic plague, the most common2.Pneumonic plague\\n3. Typhoidal plague4.Septicaemic plague\\nBUBONIC PLAGUE.  This form is characterised by rapid\\nappearance of tender, fluctuant and enlarged regionallymph nodes, several centimeters in diameter, and mayhave discharging sinuses on the skin.\\nMicroscopically,  the features are as under:\\nEffaced architecture of lymph nodes due to necrosis\\nin and around the affected nodes.\\nMultiple necrotising granulomas.\\nCharacteristic mononuclear inflammatory response.\\nMasses of proliferating bacilli in sinusoids of lymph\\nnodes.\\nCellulitis in the vicinity.\\nPNEUMONIC PLAGUE.  This is the most dreaded form\\nof plague that occurs by inhalation of bacilli from air-borne\\nparticles of carcasses of animals or from affected patient’s\\ncough. It is characterised by occurrence of broncho-\\npneumonia, with the following conspicuous microscopic\\nfeatures:\\nNecrosis of alveolar walls.\\nIntense hyperaemia and haemorrhages.\\nNumerous bacilli in the alveolar lumina.\\nCharacteristic mononuclear inflammatory response\\nwith very scanty neutrophils.\\nTYPHOIDAL PLAGUE.  This form of plague is\\nunassociated with regional lymphadenopathy. The lesions\\nin typhoidal plague are as follows:\\nNecrotic foci in visceral lymphoid tissue.\\nNecrotic areas in parenchymal visceral organs.\\nG.I. manifestations with diarrhoea and pain abdomen.\\nSEPTICAEMIC PLAGUE.   This is a form of progressive,\\nfulminant bacterial infection associated with profoundsepticaemia in the absence of apparent regional\\nlymphadenitis.Figure 7.2 Forms of plague.\\n178SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesANTHRAX\\nAnthrax is a bacterial disease of antiquity caused by Bacillus\\nanthracis  that spreads from animals to man. The disease is\\nwidely prevalent in cattle and sheep but human infection is\\nrare. However, much of knowledge on human anthrax hasbeen gained owing to fear of use of these bacteria for militarypurpose by rogue countries or for “bio-terrorism” (othermicrobial diseases in this list include: botulism, pneumonicplague, smallpox). A few years back, the human form ofdisease attracted a lot of attention of the media and thecivilised world due to its use in the form of anthrax-lacedletters sent by possible terrorist groups as a retaliatorybiological weapon against the US interest subsequent topunitive attacks by the US on Afghanistan as an aftermathof September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US. In India,anthrax in animals is endemic in South due to largeunprotected and uncontrolled live-stock population.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The causative organism, Bacillus\\nanthracis, is a gram-positive, aerobic bacillus, 4.5 μm long. It\\nis a spore-forming bacillus and the spores so formed outside\\nthe body are quite resistant. The disease occurs as anexogenous infection by contact with soil or animal productscontaminated with spores.\\nDepending upon the portal of entry, three types of human\\nanthrax is known to occur:\\ni)Cutaneous form  by direct contact with skin and is most\\ncommon.ii)Pulmonary form by inhalation, also called as “wool-\\nsorters’ disease” and is most fatal.\\niii)Gastrointestinal form  by ingestion and is rare.\\nThe mechanism of infection includes spread of bacilli\\nfrom the portal of entry to the regional lymph nodes through\\nlymphatics where the bacteria proliferate. There is delayedaccumulation of polymorphs and macrophages.\\nMacrophages also play a role in expression of bacterial\\ntoxicity; bacterial toxin is quite lethal to macrophages.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES . The characteristic lesions\\nof anthrax are haemorrhage, oedema and necrosis at theportal of entry.\\n1.Cutaneous anthrax  \\nis the most common and occurs in\\ntwo forms: one type is characterised by necrotic lesion due\\nto vascular thrombosis, haemorrhage and acellular\\nnecrosis, while the other form begins as a pimple at the\\npoint of entry of B. anthracis  into the abraded exposed skin,\\nmore often in the region of hands and the head and neck.\\nThe initial lesion develops into a vesicle or blister\\ncontaining clear serous or blood-stained fluid swarming\\nwith anthrax bacilli which can be identified readily by\\nsmear examination. The bursting of the blister is followed\\nby extensive oedema and black tissue necrosis resultingin formation of severe ‘malignant pustule’. Regional\\nlymph nodes are invariably involved along with profound\\nsepticaemia.\\n2. Pulmonary anthrax (wool-sorters’ disease)  occurring\\nfrom inhalation of spores of B. anthracis  in infectiousaerosols results in rapid development of malignant\\npustule in the bronchus. This is followed by development\\nof primary extensive necrotising pneumonia and\\nhaemorrhagic mediastinitis which is invariably fatal.\\n3. Intestinal anthrax  is rare in human beings and is quite\\nsimilar to that seen in cattle. Septicaemia and death often\\nresults in this type too. The lesions consist of mucosal\\noedema, small necrotic ulcers, massive fluid loss and\\nhaemorrhagic mesenteric lymphadenitis.\\nBesides, anthrax septicaemia results in spread of\\ninfection to all other organs.\\nLABORATORY DIAGNOSIS.  Anthrax can be diagnosed by\\na few simple techniques:i) Smear examination:  Gram stained smear shows rod-shaped,\\nspore-forming, gram-positive bacilli. Endospores aredetectable by presence of unstained defects or holes within\\nthe cell.\\nii) Culture:  Anthrax bacteria grow on sheep blood agar as\\nflat colonies with an irregular margin (medusa head).\\nAnthrax contaminated work surfaces, materials and\\nequipment must be decontaminated with 5% hypochlorite\\nor 5% phenol.\\nWHOOPING COUGH (PERTUSSIS)\\nWhooping cough is a highly communicable acute bacterial\\ndisease of childhood caused by Bordetella  pertussis.  The use\\nof DPT vaccine has reduced the prevalence of whooping\\ncough in different populations.\\nThe causative organism, B. pertussis,  has strong tropism\\nfor the brush border of the bronchial epithelium. Theorganisms proliferate here and stimulate the bronchial\\nepithelium to produce abundant tenacious mucus. Within\\n7-10 days after exposure, catarrhal stage begins which is themost infectious stage. There is low grade fever, rhinorrhoea,conjunctivitis and excess tear production. Paroxysms ofcough occur with characteristic ‘whoop’. The condition is self-limiting but may cause death due to asphyxia in infants. B.\\npertussis  produces a heat-labile toxin, a heat-stable endotoxin,\\nand a lymphocytosis-producing factor called histamine-sensitising factor.\\nMicroscopically,  the lesions in the respiratory tract consist\\nof necrotic bronchial epithelium covered by thickmucopurulent exudate. In severe cases, there is mucosal\\nerosion and hyperaemia. The peripheral blood shows\\nmarked lymphocytosis upto 90% (Fig. 7.3) and\\nenlargement of lymphoid follicles in the bronchial mucosaand peribronchial lymph nodes.\\nGRANULOMA INGUINALE\\nGranuloma inguinale is a sexually-transmitted disease\\naffecting the genitalia and inguinal and perianal regions\\ncaused by Calymmatobacterium donovani . The disease is\\ncommon in tropical and subtropical countries such as NewGuinea, Australia and India. The organism inhabits theintestinal tract. The infection is transmitted through vaginal179CHAPTER 7 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases\\nor anal intercourse and by autoinoculation. The incubation\\nperiod varies from 2 to 4 weeks. Initially, the lesion is in the\\nform of a papule, a subcutaneous nodule or an ulcer. Within\\na few weeks, it develops into a raised, soft, painless, reddishulcer with exuberant granulation tissue. Depending uponwhether the individual is heterosexual or homosexual, thelesions are located on the penis, scrotum, genito-crural foldsand inguinal folds, or in the perianal and anal area respecti-\\nvely. Regional lymphadenopathy generally does not occur.\\nMicroscopically,  the margin of the ulcer shows epithelial\\nhyperplasia. The ulcer bed shows neutrophilic abscesses.The dermis and subcutaneous tissues are infiltrated by\\nnumerous histiocytes containing many bacteria calledDonovan bodies, and lymphocytes, plasma cells and\\nneutrophils. These organisms are best demonstrated bysilver impregnation techniques.\\nSTAPHYLOCOCCAL INFECTIONS\\nStaphylococci are gram-positive cocci which are present\\neverywhere—in the skin, umbilicus, nasal vestibule, stooletc. Three species are pathogenic to human beings: Staph.\\naureus, Staph. epidermidis and Staph. saprophyticus.  Most\\nstaphylococcal infections are caused by Staph. aureus.\\nStaphylococcal infections are among the commonestantibiotic-resistant hospital-acquired infection in surgicalwounds.\\nA wide variety of suppurative diseases are caused by\\nStaph. aureus  which includes the following (Fig. 7.4):\\n1.Infections of skin.  Staphylococcal infections of the skin\\nare quite common. The infection begins from lodgement ofcocci in the hair root due to poor hygiene and results inobstruction of sweat or sebaceous gland duct. This is termedfolliculitis.  Involvement of adjacent follicles results in larger\\nlesions called furuncle.  Further spread of infection\\nhorizontally under the skin and subcutaneous tissue causescarbuncle  or cellulitis.  Styes  are staphylococcal infection of the\\nsebaceous glands of Zeis, the glands of Moll and eyelashfollicles. Impetigo  is yet another staphylococcal skin infection\\ncommon in school children in which there are multiplepustular lesions on face forming honey-yellow crusts. Breast\\nabscess  may occur following delivery when staphylococci are\\ntransmitted from infant having neonatal sepsis or due tostasis of milk.\\n2. Infections of burns and surgical wounds.  These are quite\\ncommon due to contamination from the patient’s own nasal\\nsecretions or from hospital staff. Elderly, malnourished, obesepatients and neonates have increased susceptibility.\\n3.Infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract.\\nSmall children under 2 years of age get staphylococcal\\ninfections of the respiratory tract commonly. These includepharyngitis, bronchopneumonia, staphylococcalpneumonia and its complications.\\n4.\\nBacterial arthritis.  Septic arthritis in the elderly is caused\\nby Staph. aureus.\\n5. Infection of bone (Osteomyelitis).  Young boys having\\nhistory of trauma or infection may develop acute\\nstaphylococcal osteomyelitis (Chapter 28).\\n6. Bacterial endocarditis.  Acute and subacute bacterial\\nendocarditis are complications of infection with Staph. aureus\\nand Staph. epidermidis  (Chapter 16).\\n7. Bacterial meningitis.  Surgical procedures on central\\nnervous system may lead to staphylococcal meningitis\\n(Chapter 30).Figure 7.3 Marked peripheral blood lymphocytosis in whooping\\ncough.\\nFigure 7.4 Suppurative diseases caused by Staphylococcus aureus.\\n180SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\n8. Septicaemia.  Staphylococcal septicaemia may occur in\\npatients with lowered resistance or in patients having\\nunderlying staphylococcal infections. Patients present with\\nfeatures of bacteraemia such as shaking chills and fever\\n(Chapter 6).\\n9. Toxic shock syndrome.  Toxic shock syndrome is a serious\\ncomplication of staphylococcal infection characterised by\\nfever, hypotension and exfoliative skin rash. The conditionaffects young menstruating women who use tampons ofsome brands which when kept inside the vagina causeabsorption of staphylococcal toxins from the vagina.\\nSTREPTOCOCCAL INFECTIONS\\nStreptococci are also gram-positive cocci but unlike\\nstaphylococci, they are more known for their non-suppurative autoimmune complications than suppurativeinflammatory responses. Streptococcal infections occurthroughout the world but their problems are greater inunderprivileged populations where antibiotics are notinstituted readily.\\nThe following groups and subtypes of streptococci have\\nbeen identified and implicated in different streptococcaldiseases (Fig. 7.5):\\n1.Group A or Streptococcus pyogenes,  also called β-haemo-\\nlytic streptococci, are involved in causing upper respiratorytract infection and cutaneous infections (erysipelas). Inaddition, beta haemolytic streptococci are involved inautoimmune reactions in the form of rheumatic heart disease(RHD).\\n2.Group B or Streptococcus agalactiae  produces infections in\\nthe newborn and is involved in non-suppurative post-streptococcal complications such as RHD and acute\\nglomerulonephritis.\\n3.Group C and G streptococci  are responsible for respiratory\\ninfections.\\n4.Group D or Streptococcus faecalis,  also called enterococci\\nare important in causation of urinary tract infection, bacterial\\nendocarditis, septicaemia etc.\\n5.Untypable \\nα-haemolytic streptococci  such as Streptococcus\\nviridans  constitute the normal flora of the mouth and may\\ncause bacterial endocarditis.6.Pneumococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae  are etiologic\\nagents for bacterial pneumonias, meningitis and septicaemia.\\nCLOSTRIDIAL DISEASES\\nClostridia are gram-positive spore-forming anaerobic\\nmicroorganisms found in the gastrointestinal tract ofherbivorous animals and man. These organisms mayundergo vegetative division under anaerobic conditions, andsporulation under aerobic conditions. These spores arepassed in faeces and can survive in unfavourable conditions.On degeneration of these microorganisms, the plasmids areliberated which produce many toxins responsible for thefollowing clostridial diseases depending upon the species(Fig. 7.6):1. Gas gangrene by C. perfringens\\n2.Tetanus by C. tetani\\n3. Botulism by C. botulinum\\n4.Clostridial food poisoning by C. perfringens\\n5.\\nNecrotising enterocolitis by C. perfringens.\\nGAS GANGRENE.  Gas gangrene is a rapidly progressive\\nand fatal illness in which there is myonecrosis of previouslyhealthy skeletal muscle due to elaboration of myotoxins bysome species of clostridia. In majority of cases (80-90%), thesource of myotoxins is C. perfringens  Type A; others are C.\\nnovyi  and C. septicum.  Generally, traumatic wounds and\\nsurgical procedures are followed by contamination withclostridia and become the site of myonecrosis. The incuba-tion period is 2 to 4 days. The most common myotoxinproduced by C. perfringens  Type A is the alpha toxin which\\nis a lecithinase. The prevention of gas gangrene lies indebridement of damaged tissue in which the clostridia thrive.The lesion has serosanguineous discharge with odour andcontains gas bubbles. There is very scanty inflammatoryreaction at the site of gas gangrene.\\nTETANUS.  Tetanus or ‘lock jaw’ is a severe acute neuro-\\nlogic syndrome caused by tetanus toxin, tetanospasmin,\\nwhich is a neurotoxic exotoxin elaborated by C. tetani.  The\\nspores of the microorganism present in the soil enter the bodythrough a penetrating wound. In underdeveloped countries,tetanus in neonates is seen due to application of soil or dungon the umbilical stump. The degenerated microorganismsliberate the tetanus neurotoxin which causes neuronalstimulation and spasm of muscles. The incubation period ofthe disease is 1-3 weeks. The earliest manifestation is lock-jaw or trismus. Rigidity of muscles of the back causesbackward arching or opisthotonos. Death occurs due tospasm of respiratory and laryngeal muscles.Figure 7.5 Diseases caused by streptococci.\\n181CHAPTER 7 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases\\nBOTULISM.  Botulism is characterised by symmetric\\nparalysis of cranial nerves, limbs and trunk. The condition\\noccurs following ingestion of food contaminated withneurotoxins of C. botulinum  and less often by contamination\\nof a penetrating wound. The spores of C. botulinum  are\\ncapable of surviving in unfavourable conditions andcontaminate vegetables and other foods, especially ifimproperly stored or canned. The symptoms of botulismbegin to appear within 12 to 36 hours of ingestion of foodcontaining the neurotoxins (type A to type G). The toxinsresist gastric digestion and are absorbed from the upperportion of small intestine and enter the blood. On reachingthe cholinergic nerve endings, the toxin binds to membranereceptors and inhibits release of acetylcholine resulting inparalysis and respiratory failure.\\nCLOSTRIDIAL FOOD POISONING.  Clostridial food\\npoisoning is caused by enterotoxin elaborated by C.\\nperfringens.  Out of five serotypes of C. perfringens,  type A\\nand C produce alpha-enterotoxin that causes food poisoning.\\nThese serotypes of organism are omnipresent in theenvironment and thus clostridial poisoning occursthroughout the world. Food poisoning from C. perfringens  is\\nmostly from ingestion of meat and its products which havebeen allowed to dry resulting in dehydration and anaerobicconditions suitable for growth of C. perfringens.  The\\ncontaminated meat contains vegetative form of the organismand no preformed enterotoxin (unlike botulism where pre-formed neurotoxin of C. botulinum  is ingested). On ingestion\\nof the contaminated meat, alpha-enterotoxin is produced inthe intestine. Symptoms of the food poisoning appear within12 hours of ingestion of contaminated meat and recoveryoccurs within 2 days.NECROTISING ENTEROCOLITIS.  Necrotising entero-\\ncolitis or ‘pig bel’ is caused by beta-enterotoxin produced by\\nC. perfringens  Type C. The condition occurs especially in\\nundernourished children who suddenly indulge in\\novereating such as was first reported participation in pigfeasts by poor children in New Guinea and hence the name\\n‘pig bel’. Adults do not develop the condition due to good\\nantibody response.\\nIngestion of contaminated pork by malnourished children\\nwho normally take protein-deficient vegetarian diet causes\\nelaboration of beta-enterotoxin. The symptoms appear within\\n48 hours after ingestion of contaminated meat. These include:severe abdominal pain, distension, vomiting and passage ofbloody stools. Milder form of disease runs a course similar\\nto other forms of gastroenteritis while fulminant ‘pig bel’\\nmay result in death of the child.\\nGrossly,  the disease affects small intestine segmentally.\\nThe affected segment of bowel shows green, necroticpseudomembrane covering the necrotic mucosa and thereis associated peritonitis. Advanced cases may show\\nperforation of the bowel wall.\\nMicroscopically,  there is transmural infiltration by acute\\ninflammatory cell infiltrate with changes of mucosal\\ninfarction, oedema and haemorrhage (Chapter 20). Thepseudomembrane consists of necrotic epithelium withentangled bacilli.\\nDISEASES CAUSED BY FUNGI\\nOf the large number of known fungi, only a few are infectiveto human beings. Many of the human fungal infections are\\nopportunistic i.e. they occur in conditions with impaired host\\nimmune mechanisms. Such conditions include defectiveneutrophil function, administration of corticosteroids,immunosuppressive therapy and immunodeficiency states\\n(congenital and acquired). A list of common fungal infections\\nof human beings is given in Table 7.3 . A few important\\nrepresentative e xamples are discussed below.Figure 7.6 Diseases caused by clostridia.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 7.3: Diseases Caused by Fungi.\\nDisease Etiologic Agent\\n1.

The material discharged from the sinusesis in the form of grains consisting of colonies of fungi orbacteria. Mycetomas are of 2 main types:\\nMycetomas  caused by actinomyces (higher bacteria)\\ncomprising about 60% of cases (page 163).\\nEumycetomas  caused by true fungi comprising the\\nremaining 40% of the cases.\\nMost common fungi causative for eumycetoma are\\nMadurella mycetomatis  or Madurella grisea,  both causing black\\ngranules from discharging sinuses. Eumycetomas areparticularly common in Northern and tropical Africa,Southern Asia and tropical America. The organisms areinoculated directly from soil into barefeet, from carrying ofcontaminated sacks on the shoulders, and into the hands frominfected vegetation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  After several months of\\ninfection, the affected site, most commonly foot, is swollenand hence the name ‘madura foot’. The lesions extenddeeply into the subcutaneous tissues, along the fascia andeventually invade the bones. They drain through sinustracts which discharge purulent material and grains. Thesurrounding tissue shows granulomatous reaction(Fig. 7.7) .\\nCANDIDIASIS\\nCandidiasis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused most\\ncommonly by  Candida albicans  and occasionally by Candida\\ntropicalis.  In human beings, Candida species are present as\\nnormal flora of the skin and mucocutaneous areas, intestinesand vagina. The organism becomes pathogenic when thebalance between the host and the organism is disturbed.Various predisposing factors are: impaired immunity,prolonged use of oral contraceptives, long-term antibiotictherapy, corticosteroid therapy, diabetes mellitus, obesity,pregnancy etc.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Candida produces super-\\nficial infections of the skin and mucous membranes, or\\nmay invade deeper tissues as described under:\\n1.Oral thrush.  This is the commonest form of muco-\\ncutaneous candidiasis seen especially in early life. Full-\\nfledged lesions consist of creamy white pseudomembrane\\ncomposed of fungi covering the tongue, soft palate, andbuccal mucosa. In severe cases, ulceration may be seen.\\n2. Candidal vaginitis.  Vaginal candidiasis or monilial\\nvaginitis is characterised clinically by thick, yellow, curdy\\ndischarge. The lesions form pseudomembrane of fungi on\\nthe vaginal mucosa. They are quite pruritic and may\\nextend to involve the vulva (vulvovaginitis) and the\\nperineum.\\n3. Cutaneous candidiasis.  Candidal involvement of nail\\nfolds producing change in the shape of nail plate\\n(paronychia) and colonisation in the intertriginous areas\\nof the skin, axilla, groin, infra- and inter-mammary,\\nintergluteal folds and interdigital spaces are some of the\\ncommon forms of cutaneous lesions caused by  Candida\\nalbicans (Fig. 7.8) .\\n4. Systemic candidiasis.  Invasive candidiasis is rare and\\nis usually a terminal event of an underlying disorderassociated with impaired immune system. The organisms\\ngain entry into the body through an ulcerative lesion on\\nthe skin and mucosa or may be introduced by iatrogenicmeans such as via intravenous infusion, peritoneal dialysisor urinary catheterisation. The lesions of systemic\\ncandidiasis are most commonly encountered in kidneys\\nas ascending pyelonephritis and in heart as candidalendocarditis.\\nFigure 7.7 Madura foot. Brown granule lying in necrotic tissue in\\nthe discharging sinus.Figure 7.8 Candidiasis of the ulcer in the skin.\\n183CHAPTER 7 Infectious and Parasitic DiseasesSUPERFICIAL MYCOSIS\\nDermatophytes are the most important example of cutaneous\\nmycosis caused by Microsporum, Trichophyton  and\\nEpidermophyton.  These superficial fungi are spread by direct\\ncontact or by fomites and infect tissues such as the skin, hairand nails. Examples of diseases pertaining to these tissuesare as under:\\nTinea capitis  characterised by patchy alopecia affecting\\nthe scalp and eyebrows.\\nTinea barbae  is acute folliculitis of the beard.\\nTinea corporis  is dermatitis with formation of\\nerythematous papules.\\nThe diagnosis of dermatophytosis is made by light\\nmicroscopic examination of skin scrapings after addition ofsodium or potassium hydroxide solution. Other methodsinclude fungal culture and demonstration of fungus in tissuesections.\\nDISEASES CAUSED BY VIRUSES\\nViral diseases are the most common cause of human illness.However, many of the viral infections remain asymptomaticwhile others produce viral disease. Another peculiar featureof viral infection is that a single etiologic agent may producedifferent diseases in the same host depending upon hostimmune response and age at infection e.g. varicella-zostervirus is causative for chickenpox as well as herpes zoster.Viruses are essentially intracellular parasites. Dependingupon their nucleic acid genomic composition, they may besingle-stranded or double-stranded, RNA or DNA viruses.A list of common viruses and diseases caused by them isgiven in  Table 7.4.  Oncogenic viruses and their role inneoplasms are discussed in Chapter 8. A few common andimportant viral diseases are described below.\\nVIRAL HAEMORRHAGIC FEVERS\\nViral haemorrhagic fevers are a group of acute viral infections\\nwhich have common features of causing haemorrhage s,\\nshock and sometimes death. Viruses causing haemorrhagicfevers were earlier called ar\\nthropod- borne (or arbo)  viruses\\nsince their transmission was considered to be fromarthropods to humans. However, now it is known that allsuch viruses are not transmitted by arthropod vectors aloneand hence now such haemorrhagic fevers are classifiedaccording to the routes of transmission and otherepidemiologic features into 4 groups:\\nMosquito-borne (e.g. yellow fever, dengue fever, Rift\\nValley fever)\\nTick-borne (e.g. Crimean haemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur\\nForest disease)\\nZoonotic (e.g. Korean haemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever)\\nMarburg virus disease and Ebola virus disease by\\nunknown route.\\nOf these, mosquito-borne viral haemorrhagic fevers in\\nwhich Aedes aegypti  mosquitoes are vectors, are the most\\ncommon problem the world over, especially in developing\\ncountries. Two important examples of Aedes mosquito-borne\\nviral haemorrhagic fevers are yellow fever and dengue fever,\\nwhich are discussed below.\\nYellow Fever\\nYellow fever is the oldest known viral haemorrhagic fever\\nrestricted to some regions of Africa and South America.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 7.4: Diseases Caused by Viruses.\\nDisease Etiologic Agent\\n1.

Major pathologic changes\\nare seen in the liver and kidneys.\\nLiver.  The characteristic changes include:\\ni) midzonal necrosis;\\nii) Councilman bodies; andiii) microvesicular fat.\\nKidneys.  The kidneys show the following changes:\\ni) coagulative necrosis of proximal tubules;\\nii) accumulation of fat in the tubular epithelium; andiii) haemorrhages.\\nPatients tend to recover without sequelae and death\\nrate is less than 5%, death resulting from hepatic or renalfailure, and petechial haemorrhages in the brain.\\nDengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)\\nThe word dengue is derived from African word ‘denga’\\nmeaning fever with haemorrhages. Dengue is caused by virus\\ntransmitted by bites of mosquito Aedes aegypti;  the\\ntransmission being highest during and after rainy seasonwhen mosquitos are numerous. DHF was first described in\\n1953 when it struck Philippines. An outbreak of DHF\\noccurred in Delhi and neighbouring cities in 1996 claimingseveral lives. Since then, some cases of DHF have beenreported in post-monsoon period every year in North India.\\nDengue occurs in two forms:\\n1.Dengue fever or break-bone fever  in an uncomplicated way\\nis a self-limited febrile illness affecting muscles and jointswith severe back pain due to myalgia (and hence the name\\n‘break-bone’ fever).\\n2.Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF),  on the other hand, is a\\nsevere and potentially fatal form of acute febrile illness\\ncharacterised by cutaneous and intestinal haemorrhages due\\nto thrombocytopenia, haemoconcentration, hypovolaemicshock and neurologic disturbances. DHF is most common in\\nchildren under 15 years of age.\\nDengue virus infects blood monocytes, lymphocytes and\\nendothelial cells. This initiates complement activation and\\nconsumptive coagulopathy including thrombocytopenia. Theentire process takes place rapidly and may evolve over aperiod of a few hours. If patient is treated appropriately atthis stage, there is rapid and dramatic recovery. But inuntreated cases, dengue shock syndrome  develops and death\\noccurs.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The predominant organ\\nchanges in  DHF  are due to following:\\ni)focal haemorrhages and congestion;\\nii\\n) increased vascular permeability resulting in oedema\\nin different organs;iii) coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia; andiv) haemoconcentration.\\nThe main abnormalities in investigations in DHF  are\\nas under:i) Leucopenia with relative lymphocytosis, sometimeswith atypical lymphocytesii) Thrombocytopeniaiii) Elevated haematocrit due to haemoconcentrationiv) X-ray chest showing bilateral pleural effusionv) Deranged liver function tests (elevated transaminases,hypoalbuminaemia and reversed A:G ratio)vi) Prolonged coagulation tests (prothrombin time,activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time)\\nDiagnosis  of DHF is confirmed by:\\nserologic testing for detection of antibodies;\\ndetection of virus by immunofluorescence method and\\nmonoclonal antibodies; and\\nrapid methods such as reverse transcriptase-PCR and\\nfluorogenic-ELISA.\\nAt autopsy,  the predominant organ changes observed\\nare as follows:i)Brain:  intracranial haemorrhages, cerebral oedema,\\ndengue encephalitis.ii)Liver:  enlarged; necrosis of hepatocytes and Kupffer\\ncells, Reye’s syndrome in children.iii)Kidneys:  petechial haemorrhages and features of renal\\nfailure.iv)Muscles and joints:  perivascular mononuclear cell\\ninfiltrate.\\nChikungunya Virus Infection\\nThe word chikungunya means “that which bends up” and\\nis derived from the language in Africa where this viraldisease was first found in human beings. Chikungunya virusinfection is primarily a disease in nonhuman primates butthe infection is transmitted to humans by A. aegypti\\nmosquito. The disease is endemic in parts of Africa and Asiaand occurs sporadically elsewhere. A massive outbreakoccurred in 2004 in Indian Ocean region affecting people inSri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius and parts of India.\\nClinically,  the disease is characterised by abrupt onset of\\nfever, severe arthralgia (producing bending posture ofpatient due to pain and hence the name), migratorypolyarthritis affecting small joints, chills, headache, anorexia,nausea, abdominal pain, rash, petechiae and ocularsymptoms such as photophobia.\\nMajor laboratory findings  include leucopenia, mild\\nthrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases and raised CRP.\\nINFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTIONS\\nInfluenza virus infection is an important and common form\\nof communicable disease, especially prevalent as a seasonalinfection in the developed countries. Its general clinicalfeatures range from a mild afebrile illness similar to commoncold by appearance of sudden fever, headache, myalgia,malaise, chills and respiratory tract manifestations such ascough, soar throat to a more severe form of acute respiratory185CHAPTER 7 Infectious and Parasitic Diseasesillness and lymphadenopathy. Various forms of influenza\\nvirus infections have occurred as an outbreak at differenttimes, sometimes with alarming morbidity and mortality inthe world. Seasonal flu vaccine is administered to population\\nat high risk in these countries.\\nETIOLOGIC AGENT.  Influenza virus is a single-stranded\\nRNA virus belonging to coronaviruses. Depending upon its\\nantigenic characteristics of the nucleoprotein and matrix, 3distinct types are known: A, B and C. Out of these, influenzatype A is responsible for most serious and severe forms ofoutbreaks in human beings while types B and C cause a milderform of illness. Type A influenza virus is further subtypedbased on its 2 viral surface features:\\nHaemagglutinin (H):  H antigen elicits host immune\\nresponse by antibodies and determines the futureprotection against influenza A viruses. There are 16 distinctH subtypes of type A influenza viruses.\\nNeuraminidase (N):  Antibody response against N antigen\\nlimits the spread of viral infection and is responsible for\\nreduction of infection. N antigen of influenza A exists in 9subtypes.\\nThus, the subtypes of influenza A viruses are\\ndesignated by denoting serial subtype numbers of H andN antigens as H1N1, H2N2 etc.\\nInfluenza A viruses infect human beings, birds, pigs and\\nhorses. In view of a high antigenic variation in H and Ncomponents, influenza A viruses are responsible for manyknown epidemics and pandemics in history and in presenttimes. Major antigenic variation in H or N antigens is calledantigenic shift while minor variation is termed antigenic drift.\\nIn general, population at high risk are immunosuppressedpatients, elderly individuals and infants.\\nTwo of the known subtypes of influenza A viruses which\\nhave affected the mankind in recent times and have attracteda lot of attention of the media and the WHO are as under:\\nAvian influenza virus A/H5N1 commonly called\\n“bird flu”.\\nSwine influenza virus A/H1N1 commonly called\\n“swine flu”.\\n These two entities are briefly discussed below.\\nBird Flu ((Influenza A/H5N1)\\nH5N1 subtype of the influenza type A virus infection causes\\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which is thehuman form of bird flu or avian influenza with havingsimilar symptomatology. Every year, there have beenoutbreaks in poultry birds in different parts of the worldresulting in slaughtering of millions of infected chickensevery year. Human outbreak of the disease called SARSreemerged in December 2003 in southern China, Hong Kongand Vietnam and then spread to other countries in Asia,Europe and America. Since then, every year there have beenseasonal outbreaks in the human form of the disease in highwinter and has so far affected 15 countries and taken a tollof over 250 lives. Its rapidly downhill and fatal clinical courseand an apprehension of pandemic has sent alarm bells all\\nover world for quarantine.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  SARS is caused by influenza type A/\\nH5N1 respiratory virus, also called SARS-associated\\ncoronaviruses (SARS-CoV). Though it is not fatal for wild\\nbirds, it can kill poultry birds and people. Humans acquire\\ninfection through contaminated nasal, respiratory and faecalmaterial from infected birds. An individual who has human\\nflu and also gets infected with bird flu, then the hybrid virus\\nso produced is highly contagious and causes lethal disease.\\nNo person-to-person transmission has been reported so far\\nbut epidemiologists fear that if it did occur it will be a global\\nepidemic. Humans do not have immune protection against\\navian viruses.\\nLABORATORY DIAGNOSIS. Following abnormalities in\\nlaboratory tests are noted:\\n1.Almost normal-to-low TLC with lymphopaenia in about\\nhalf the cases, mostly due to fall in CD4+ T cells.2\\n. Thrombocytopaenia.\\n3. Elevated liver enzymes: aminotransferases, creatine kinase\\nand LDH.\\n4.  Virus isolation by reverse transcriptase-PCR on\\nrespiratory sample, plasma, urine or stool.\\n5. Tissue culture.\\n6. Detection of serum antibodies by ELISA or\\nimmunofluorescence.\\nCLINICOPATHOLOGICAL FEATURES.  Typically, the\\ndisease begins with influenza-like features such as fever,cough, dyspnoea, sore throat, muscle aches and eyeinfection. Soon, the patient develops viral pneumoniaevident on X-ray chest and acute respiratory distress (hencethe term SARS), and terminally kidney failure.\\nThere is apprehension of an epidemic of SARS if the avian\\nvirus mutates and gains the ability to cause person-to-personinfection. Since currently vaccine is yet being developed, theavailable measures are directed at prevention of infectionsuch as by culling (killing of the infected poultry birds) andisolation of infected case.\\nSwine Flu (Influenza A/H1N1)\\nH1N1 influenza type A flu which appeared last in 1977-78 as\\na mild form of pandemic has reappeared in April 2009 as anoutbreak in Mexico but is rapidly spreading elsewhere.Presently, the disease has already spread to 39 countriesincluding US. In view of rising number of cases, with about10,000 confirmed cases and about 100 deaths by end-May 2009attributed to swine flu from all over the world, the WHO hasalerted that it may become a worldwide flu pandemic.\\nPATHOGENESIS. H1N1 influenza type A virus is primarily\\nan infection in pigs with low mortality in them. Human beings\\nacquire infection by direct contact with infected pigs.However, further transmission of H1N1 flu occurs by person-to-person contact such as by coughing, sneezing etc but it isnot known to occur from eating pork.186SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesCLINICAL FEATURES. The disease has the usual flu-like\\nclinical features, but additionally one-third of cases have been\\nfound to have diarrhoea and vomiting.\\nSince human beings do not have immune protection by\\nantibody response against H1N1 influenza type A and theusual seasonal flu vaccine does not provide protection againstH1N1, personal hygiene and prophylaxis remain the mainstay\\nof further spread of disease.\\nVARICELLA ZOSTER  VIRUS INFECTION\\nVaricella zoster virus is a member of herpes virus family and\\ncauses chickenpox (varicella) in non-immune individuals and\\nherpes zoster (shingles) in those who had chickenpox in the\\npast.\\nVaricella or chickenpox  is an acute vesicular exanthem\\noccurring in non-immune persons, especially children. The\\ncondition begins as an infection of the nasopharynx. Onentering the blood stream, viraemia is accompanied by onset\\nof fever, malaise and anorexia. Maculopapular skin rash,\\nusually on the upper trunk and face, develops in a day ortwo. This is followed by formation of vesicles which ruptureand heal with formation of scabs. A few cases may developcomplications which include pneumonia, hepatitis,encephalitis, carditis, orchitis, arthritis, and haemorrhages.\\nHerpes zoster or shingles  is a recurrent, painful, vesicular\\neruption caused by reactivation of dormant varicella zoster\\nvirus in an individual who had chickenpox in the earlieryears. The condition is infectious and spreads to children.The virus during the latent period resides in the dorsal rootspinal ganglia or in the cranial nerve ganglia. On reactivation,\\nthe virus spreads from the ganglia to the sensory nerves and\\nto peripheral nerves. Unlike chickenpox, the vesicles inshingles are seen in one or more of the sensory dermatomesand along the peripheral nerves. The lesions are particularlypainful as compared with painless eruptions in chickenpox.\\nHERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS INFECTION\\nTwo of the herpes simplex viruses (HSV)—type 1 and 2,\\ncause ‘fever blisters’ and herpes genitalis respectively.\\nHSV-1  causes vesicular lesions on the skin, lips and\\nmucous membranes. The infection spreads by close contact.\\nThe condition is particularly severe in immunodeficientpatients and neonates while milder attacks of infection causefever-blisters on lips, oral mucosa and skin. Severe cases maydevelop complications such as meningoencephalitis andkeratoconjunctivitis. Various stimuli such as fever, stress andrespiratory infection reactivate latent virus lying in theganglia and result in recurrent attacks of blisters.\\nHSV-2  causes herpes genitalis characterised by vesicular\\nand necrotising lesions on the cervix, vagina and vulva. LikeHSV-1 infection, lesions caused by HSV-2 are also recurrentand develop in non-immune individuals. Latency of HSV-2infection is similar to HSV-1 and the organisms arereactivated by stimuli such as menstruation and sexualintercourse.LYMPHOGRANULOMA  VENEREUM\\nLymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually-\\ntransmitted disease caused by Chlamydia  trachomatis  and is\\ncharacterised by mucocutaneous lesions and regional\\nlymphadenopathy. Though described here under viralinfections, chlamydia are no more considered as filterableviruses as was previously thought but are instead\\nintracellular gram-negative bacteria. LGV is worldwide in\\ndistribution but its prevalence rate is high in tropics andsubtropics in Africa, South-East Asia and India.\\nThe condition begins as a painless, herpes-like lesion on\\nthe cervix, vagina, or penis. The organisms are carried vialymphatics to regional lymph nodes. The involved lymph\\nnodes are tender, fluctuant and may ulcerate and drain pus.\\nMicroscopically,  the lymph nodes have characteristic\\nstellate-shaped abscesses surrounded by a zone of\\nepithelioid cells (granuloma). Healing stage of the acutelesion takes place by fibrosis and permanent destructionof lymphoid structure.\\nCAT-SCRATCH DISEASE\\nAnother condition related to LGV, cat-scratch disease, is\\ncaused by Bartonella henselae,  an organism linked to rickettsiae\\nbut unlike rickettsiae this organism can be grown in culture.\\nThe condition occurs more commonly in children (under 18years of age). There is regional nodal enlargement whichappears about 2 weeks after cat-scratch, and sometimes after\\nthorn injury. The lympha denopathy is self-limited and\\nregresses in 2-4 months.\\nMicroscopically  the changes in lymph node are\\ncharacteristics:i)Initially, there is formation of non-caseating sarcoid-\\nlike granulomas.i\\ni) Subsequently, there are neutrophilic abscesses\\nsurrounded by pallisaded histiocytes and fibroblasts, anappearance simulating LGV discussed above.\\niii) The organism is extracellular and can be identified by\\nsilver stains.\\nRABIES\\nRabies is a fatal form of encephalitis in humans caused by\\nrabies virus. The virus is transmitted into the human body\\nby a bite by infected carnivores e.g. dog, wolf, fox and bats.\\nThe virus spreads from the contaminated saliva of these\\nanimals. The organism enters a peripheral nerve and then\\ntravels to the spinal cord and brain. A latent period of 10\\ndays to 3 months may elapse between the bite and onset of\\nsymptoms. Since the virus localises at the brainstem, it\\nproduces classical symptoms of difficulty in swallowing and\\npainful spasm of the throat termed hydrophobia. Other\\nclinical features such as irritability, seizure and delirium point\\ntowards viral encephalopathy. Death occurs within a period\\nof a few weeks.\\nMicroscopically,  neurons of the brainstem show\\ncharacteristic Negri bodies which are intracytoplasmic,\\ndeeply eosinophilic inclusions.187CHAPTER 7 Infectious and Parasitic DiseasesDISEASES CAUSED BY PARASITES\\nDiseases caused by parasites (protozoa and helminths) are\\nquite common and comprise a very large group ofinfestations and infections in human beings. Parasites maycause disease due to their presence in the lumen of theintestine, due to infiltration into the blood stream, or due totheir presence inside the cells. A short list of parasitic diseasesis given in Table 7.5 . These diseases form a distinct subject\\nof study called Parasitology; only a few conditions are brieflyconsidered below.\\nAMOEBIASIS\\nAmoebiasis is caused by Entamoeba histolytica,  named for its\\nlytic action on tissues. It is the most important intestinal\\ninfection of man. The condition is particularly more commonin tropical and subtropical areas with poor sanitation.\\nThe parasite occurs in 2 forms: a trophozoite form  which is\\nactive adult form seen in the tissues and diarrhoeal stools,and a cystic form  seen in formed stools but not in the tissues.\\nThe trophozoite form can be stained positively with PAS stainin tissue sections while amoebic cysts having four nuclei canbe identified in stools. The cysts are the infective stage of theparasite and are found in contaminated water or food. Thetrophozoites are formed from the cyst stage in the intestineand colonise in the caecum and large bowel. The trophozoitesas well as cysts are passed in stools but the trophozoites failto survive outside or are destroyed by gastric secretions.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The lesions of amoebiasis\\ninclude amoebic colitis, amoeboma, amoebic liver abscess\\nand spread to other sites (Fig. 7.9).\\nAmoebic colitis,  the most common type of amoebic\\ninfection begins as a small area of necrosis of mucosawhich may ulcerate. These ulcerative lesions may enlarge,develop undermining of margins of the ulcer due to lytic\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 7.5: Diseases Caused by Parasites.\\nDisease Etiologic Agent\\nA.

While Plasmodium falciparum  causes malignant\\nmalaria, the other three species produce benign form of\\nillness. These parasites are transmitted by bite of femaleAnopheles  mosquito. The disease is endemic in several parts\\nof the world, especially in tropical Africa, parts of South andCentral America, India and South-East Asia.\\nThe life cycle of plasmodia is complex and is diagram-\\nmatically depicted in Fig. 7.11, A . P. falciparum  differs from\\nother forms of plasmodial species in 4 respects:Figure 7.10 Amoebic colitis.

Such\\nchronic amoebic ulcers are described as flask-shaped\\nulcers due to their shape. The margin of the ulcer shows\\ninflammatory response consisting of admixture of poly-\\nmorphonuclear as well as mononuclear cells besides the\\npresence of trophozoites of  Entamoeba histolytica (Fig. 7.10).\\nAmoeboma  is the inflammatory thickening of the wall\\nof large bowel resembling carcinoma of the colon.Microscopically,  the lesion consists of inflammatory\\ngranulation tissue, fibrosis and clusters of trophozoites atthe margin of necrotic with viable tissue.\\nAmoebic liver abscess  may be formed by invasion of\\nthe radicle of the portal vein by trophozoites. Amoebic\\nliver abscess may be single or multiple (Chapter 21). Theamoebic abscess contains yellowish-grey amorphousliquid material in which trophozoites are identified at thejunction of the viable and necrotic tissue.\\nOther sites  where spread of amoebic infection may\\noccur are peritonitis by perforation of amoebic ulcer ofcolon, extension to the lungs and pleura by rupture ofamoebic liver abscess, haematogenous spread to causeamoebic carditis and cerebral lesions, cutaneousamoebiasis via spread of rectal amoebiasis or from analintercourse.\\nMALARIA\\nMalaria is a protozoal disease caused by any one or\\ncombination of four species of plasmodia: Plasmodium vivax,\\nPlasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium ovale  and Plasmodium\\n189CHAPTER 7 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases\\n2. In falciparum malaria, there is massive absorption of\\nhaemoglobin by the renal tubules producing blackwater\\nfever (haemoglobinuric nephrosis).3. At autopsy, cerebral malaria  is characterised by\\ncongestion and petechiae on the white matter.4. Parasitised erythrocytes in falciparum malaria aresticky and get attached to endothelial cells resulting inobstruction of capillaries of deep organs such as of thebrain leading to hypoxia and death. If the patient lives,microhaemorrhages  and microinfarcts  may be seen in the\\nbrain.\\nThe diagnosis of malaria is made by demonstration of\\nmalarial parasite in thin or thick blood films or sometimesin histologic sections  (Fig. 7.12).\\nMajor complications occur in severe falciparum malaria\\nwhich may have manifestations of cerebral malaria (coma),hypoglycaemia, renal impairment, severe anaemia,i)It does not have exo-erythrocytic stage.\\nii) Erythrocytes of any age are parasitised while otherplasmodia parasitise juvenile red cells.iii) One red cell may contain more than one parasite.iv\\n) The parasitised red cells are sticky causing obstruction\\nof small blood vessels by thrombi, a feature which isresponsible for extraordinary virulence of P. falciparum.\\nThe main clinical features of malaria are cyclic peaks of\\nhigh fever accompanied by chills, anaemia andsplenomegaly.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Parasitisation and destruc-\\ntion of erythrocytes are responsible for major pathologicchanges as under  (Fig. 7.11,B):\\n1. Malarial pigment liberated by destroyed red cellsaccumulates in the phagocytic cells of the reticulo-endothelial system resulting in enlargement of the spleenand liver (hepatosplenomegaly).Figure 7.12 Malarial parasite in blood film—various stages of two main species, P. vivax  and P. falciparum.\\n190SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nFigure 7.13 Microfilariae in blood film.\\nhaemoglobinuria, jaundice, pulmonary oedema, and acidosis\\nfollowed by congestive heart failure and hypotensive shock.\\nFILARIASIS\\nWuchereria bancrofti  and Brugia malayi  are responsible for\\ncausing Bancroftian and Malayan filariasis in different\\ngeog raphic regions. The lymphatic vessels inhabit the adult\\nworm, especially in the lymph nodes, testis and epididymis.Microfilariae seen in the circulation are produced by the\\nfemale worm (Fig. 7.13) . Majority of infected patients remain\\nasymptomatic. Symptomatic cases may have two forms of\\ndisease—an acute form and a chronic form.\\nAcute form  of filariasis presents with fever, lymphangitis,\\nlymphadenitis, epididymo-orchitis, urticaria, eosinophiliaand microfilariaemia.\\nChronic form  of filariasis is characterised by lymphadeno-\\npathy, lymphoedema, hydrocele and elephantiasis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The most significant\\nhistologic changes are due to the presence of adult wormsin the lymphatic vessels causing lymphatic obstructionand lymphoedema. The regional lymph nodes are\\nenlarged and their sinuses are distended with lymph. The\\ntissues surrounding the blocked lymphatics are infiltratedby chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting oflymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils.Chronicity of the process causes enormous thickening andinduration of the skin of legs and scrotum resembling the\\nhide of an elephant and hence the name elephantiasis.\\nChylous ascites  and  chyluria  may occur due to rupture of\\nthe abdominal lymphatics.\\nCYSTICERCOSIS\\nCysticercosis is infection by the larval stage of Taenia solium ,\\nthe pork tapeworm. The adult tapeworm resides in the\\nhuman intestines. The eggs are passed in human faeces whichare ingested by pigs or they i nfect vegetables. These eggs\\nthen develop into larval stages in the host, spread by blood\\nto any site in the body and form cystic larvae termedcysticercus cellulosae . Human beings may acquire infection\\nby the larval stage by eating undercooked pork (‘measlypork’), by ingesting uncooked contaminated vegetables, andsometimes, by autoinfection.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The cysticercus may be\\nsingle or there may be multiple cysticerci in the differenttissues of the body. The cysts may occur virtuallyanywhere in body and accordingly produce symptoms;most common sites are the brain, skeletal muscle and skin.Cysticercus consists of a round to oval white cyst, about1 cm in diameter, contains milky fluid and invaginatedscolex with birefringent hooklets. The cysticercus mayremain viable for a long time and incite no inflammation.But when the embryo dies, it produces granulomatousreaction with eosinophils. Later, the lesion may becomescarred and calcified (Fig. 7.14) .\\nTORCH COMPLEX\\nAcronym ‘TORCH’ complex refers to development ofcommon complex of symptoms in infants due to infectionwith different microorganisms that include: Toxoplasma,\\nOthers, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus;\\ncategory of ‘Others’ refers to infections such as hepatitis B,\\ncoxsackievirus B, mumps and poliovirus. The infection may\\nbe acquired by the foetus during intrauterine life , or\\nperinatally and damage the foetus or infant. Since thesymptoms produced by TORCH group of organisms areindistinguishable from each other, it is a common practice in\\na suspected pregnant mother or infant to test for all the four\\nmain TORCH agents.\\nFigure 7.14 Cysticercus in skeletal muscle. The worm is seen in\\nthe cyst while the cyst wall shows palisade layer of histiocytes.\\n191CHAPTER 7 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases\\nFigure 7.15 Lesions produced by TORCH complex infection in\\nfoetus in utero.It has been estimated that TORCH complex infections\\nhave an overall incidence of 1-5% of all live born children.\\nAll the microorganisms in the TORCH complex are\\ntransmitted transplacentally and, therefore, infect the foetusfrom the mother. Herpes and cytomegalovirus infections arecommon intrapartum infections acquired venereally.\\nToxoplasmosis is a protozoal infection acquired by\\ncontact with cat’s faeces or by ingestion of raw uncookedmeat. Rubella or German measles is teratogenic in pregnantmothers. Cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus infection are\\ngenerally transmitted to foetus by chronic carrier mothers.\\nAn infectious mononucleosis-like disease is present in\\nabout 10% of mothers whose infants have Toxoplasma\\ninfection. Genital herpes infection is present in 20% ofmothers whose newborn babies suffer from herpes infection.\\nRubella infection during acute stage in the first 10 weeks ofpregnancy is more harmful to the foetus than at later stageof gestation. Symptoms of cytomegalovirus infection are\\npresent in less than 1% of mothers who display antibodies\\nto it.\\nThe classic features of syndrome produced by TORCH\\ncomplex are seen in congenital rubella. The features include:\\nocular defects, cardiac defects, CNS manifestations, sensori-\\nneural deafness, thrombocytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly\\n(Fig. 7.15) .The foetal damage caused by TORCH complex infection\\nis irreparable and, therefore, prevention and immunisation\\nare the bes t mode of therapy.\\n❑\\n192SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nChapter 8 Neoplasia Chapter 8\\nNOMENCLATURE AND CLASSIFICATION\\nINTRODUCTION.  The term ‘neoplasia’ means new growth;\\nthe new growth produced is called ‘neoplasm’ or ‘tumour’.\\nHowever, all ‘new growths’ are not neoplasms sinceexamples of new growth of tissues and cells also exist in theprocesses of embryogenesis, regeneration and repair,hyperplasia and hormonal stimulation. The proliferation andmaturation of cells in normal adults is controlled as a resultof which some cells proliferate throughout life (labile cells),some have limited proliferation (stable cells), while othersdo not replicate (permanent cells). On the other hand,neoplastic cells lose control and regulation of replication andform an abnormal mass of tissue.\\nTherefore, satisfactory definition of a neoplasm or tumour\\nis ‘a mass of tissue formed as a result of abnormal, excessive,\\nuncoordinated, autonomous and purposeless proliferation of cellseven after cessation of stimulus for growth which caused it’.  The\\nbranch of science dealing with the study of neoplasms ortumours is called oncology ( oncos =tumour, logos =study).\\nNeoplasms may be ‘benign’ when they are slow-growing andlocalised without causing much difficulty to the host, or‘malignant’ when they proliferate rapidly, spread throughoutthe body and may eventually cause death of the host. Thecommon term used for all malignant tumours is cancer.Hippocrates (460-377 \\nBC) coined the term karkinos for cancer\\nof the breast. The word ‘cancer’ means crab, thus reflectingthe true character of cancer since ‘it sticks to the partstubbornly like a crab’.\\nAll tumours, benign as well as malignant, have 2 basic\\ncomponents:‘Parenchyma’  comprised by proliferating tumour cells;\\nparenchyma determines the nature and evolution of thetumour.\\n‘Supportive stroma’  composed of fibrous connective tissue\\nand blood vessels; it provides the framework on which theparenchymal tumour cells grow.\\nThe tumours derive their nomenclature on the basis of\\nthe parenchymal component comprising them. The suffix‘-oma’  is added to denote benign tumours. Malignant tumours\\nof epithelial origin are called carcinomas,  while malignant\\nmesenchymal tumours are named sarcomas  (sarcos  = fleshy)\\n(Fig. 8.1) . However, some cancers are composed of highly\\nundifferentiated cells and are referred to as undifferentiated\\nmalignant tumours.\\nAlthough, this broad generalisation regarding\\nnomenclature of tumours usually holds true in majority of\\ninstances, some examples contrary to this concept are:melanoma  for carcinoma of the melanocytes, hepatoma  for\\ncarcinoma of the hepatocytes, lymphoma  for malignant\\ntumour of the lymphoid tissue, and seminoma  for malignant\\ntumour of the testis. Leukaemia  is the term used for cancer of\\nblood forming cells.\\nSPECIAL CATEGORIES OF TUMOURS.  Following\\ncategories of tumours are examples which defy the\\ngeneralisation in nomenclature given above:\\n1. Mixed tumours.  When two types of tumours are\\ncombined in the same tumour, it is called a mixed tumour.\\nFor example:\\ni)\\nAdenosquamous carcinoma  is the combination of\\nadenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in theendometrium.\\nFigure 8.1 Examples of carcinoma (epithelial malignant tumour) (A) and sarcoma (mesenchymal malignant tumour) (B).\\n193CHAPTER 8 Neoplasiaii) Adenoacanthoma is the mixture of adenocarcinoma and\\nbenign squamous elements in the endometrium.\\niii) Carcinosarcoma is the rare combination of malignanttumour of the epithelium (carcinoma) and of mesenchymaltissue (sarcoma) such as in thyroid.iv) Collision tumour  is the term used for morphologically two\\ndifferent cancers in the same organ which do not mix witheach other.v) Mixed tumour of the salivary gland  (or pleomorphic\\nadenoma) is the term used for benign tumour havingcombination of both epithelial and mesenchymal tissueelements.\\n2. Teratomas.  These tumours are made up of a mixture of\\nvarious tissue types arising from totipotent cells derived from\\nthe three germ cell layers—ectoderm, mesoderm andendoderm. Most common sites for teratomas are ovaries andtestis ( gonadal teratomas ). But they occur at extra-gonadal sites\\nas well, mainly in the midline of the body such as in the headand neck region, mediastinum, retroperitoneum,sacrococcygeal region etc. Teratomas may be benign or mature\\n(most of the ovarian teratomas) or malignant  or immature\\n(most of the testicular teratomas).3. Blastomas (Embryomas). Blastomas or embryomas are a\\ngroup of malignant tumours which arise from embryonal orpartially differentiated cells which would normally formblastema of the organs and tissue during embryogenesis.These tumours occur more frequently in infants and children(under 5 years of age) and include some examples of tumoursin this age group: neuroblastoma, nephroblastoma (Wilms’tumour), hepatoblastoma, retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma,pulmonary blastoma.\\n4. Hamartoma.  Hamartoma is benign tumour which is made\\nof mature but disorganised cells of tissues indigenous to the\\nparticular organ e.g. hamartoma of the lung consists ofmature cartilage, mature smooth muscle and epithelium.Thus, all mature differentiated tissue elements whichcomprise the bronchus are present in it but are jumbled upas a mass.\\n5. Choristoma . Choristoma is the name given to the ectopic\\nislands of normal tissue. Thus, choristoma is heterotopia but\\nis not a true tumour, though it sounds like one.\\nCLASSIFICATION.  Currently, classification of tumours is\\nbased on the histogenesis (i.e. cell of origin) and on the\\nanticipated behaviour (Table 8.1). However, it must be\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.1: Classification of Tumours.\\nTissue of Origin Benign Malignant\\nI. TUMOURS OF ONE PARENCHYMAL CELL TYPE\\nA\\n. Epithelial Tumours\\n1.

Detailed classifications of benign and malignanttumours pertaining to different tissues and body systemsalong with morphologic features of specific tumours appearin the specific chapters of Systemic Pathology later.\\nCHARACTERISTICS OF TUMOURS\\nMajority of neoplasms can be categorised clinically andmorphologically into benign and malignant on the basis ofcertain characteristics listed below.  However, there areexceptions—a small proportion of tumours have somefeatures suggesting innocent growth while other featurespoint towards a more ominous behaviour. Therefore, it mustbe borne in mind that based characteristics of neoplasms,there is a wide variation in the degree of deviation from thenormal in all the tumours.\\nThe characteristics of tumours are described under the\\nfollowing headings:I. Rate of growthII. Cancer phenotype and stem cellsIII. Clinical and gross featuresIV. Microscopic featuresV. Local invasion (Direct spread)VI. Metastasis (Distant spread).\\nBased on these characteristics, contrasting features of\\nbenign and malignant tumours are summarised in Table 8.2\\nand illustrated in Fig. 8.2 .I.  RATE OF GROWTH\\nThe tumour cells generally proliferate more rapidly than the\\nnormal cells. In general, benign tumours grow slowly andmalignant tumours rapidly. However, there are exceptionsto this generalisation. The rate at which the tumour enlargesdepends upon 2 main factors:1.Rate of cell production, growth fraction and rate of cell\\nloss2.Degree of differentiation of the tumour.\\n1.\\nRate of cell production, growth fraction and rate of cell\\nloss.  Rate of growth of a tumour depends upon 3 important\\nparameters:i)doubling time of tumour cells,\\nii\\n) number of cells remaining in proliferative pool (growth\\nfraction), andiii) rate of loss of tumour cells by cell shedding.\\nIn general, malignant tumour cells have increased mitotic\\nrate (doubling time) and slower death rate i.e. the cancer cellsdo not follow normal controls in cell cycle and are immortal.If the rate of cell division is high, it is likely that tumour cellsin the centre of the tumour do not receive adequatenourishment and undergo ischaemic necrosis. At a stagewhen malignant tumours grow relentlessly, they do sobecause a larger proportion of tumour cells remain inreplicative pool but due to lack of availability of adequatenourishment, these tumour cells are either lost by sheddingor leave the cell cycle to enter into G\\n0 (resting phase) or G1\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.2: Contrasting Features of Benign and Malignant Tumours.\\nFeature Benign Malignant\\nI.

While dead tumour cells appear as ‘apoptotic figures’\\n(Chapter 3), the dividing cells of tumours are seen as normaland abnormal ‘mitotic figures’ (discussed later). Ultimately,malignant tumours grow in size because the cell productionexceeds the cell loss.\\n2. Degree of differentiation.  Secondly, the rate of growth\\nof malignant tumour is directly proportionate to the degreeof differentiation. Poorly differentiated tumours show\\naggressive growth pattern as compared to better differen-\\ntiated tumours. Some tumours, after a period of slow growth,may suddenly show spurt in their growth due to develop-ment of an aggressive clone of malignant cells. On the other\\nhand, some tumours may cease to grow after sometime.\\nRarely, a malignant tumour may disappear spontaneouslyfrom the primary site, possibly due to necrosis caused by\\n196SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesgood host immune attack, only to reappear as secondaries\\nelsewhere in the body e.g. choriocarcinoma, malignantmelanoma.\\nThe regulation of tumour growth is under the control of\\ngrowth factors secreted by the tumour cells. Out of variousgrowth factors, important ones modulating tumour biologyare listed below and discussed later:i) Epidermal growth factor (EGF)ii) Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)iii) Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)iv) Colony stimulating factor (CSF)v) Transforming growth factors- β (TGF- β)\\nvi) Interleukins (IL)vii) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\\nII.  CANCER PHENOTYPE AND STEM CELLS\\nNormally growing cells in an organ are related to the\\nneighbouring cells—they grow under normal growthcontrols, perform their assigned function and there is abalance between the rate of cell proliferation and the rate ofcell death including cell suicide (i.e. apoptosis). Thus normalcells are socially desirable. However, cancer cells exhibit anti-social behaviour as under:i)Cancer cells disobey the growth controlling signals in the\\nbody and thus proliferate rapidly .\\nii)\\nCancer cells escape death signals and achieve immortality .\\niii) Imbalance between cell proliferation and cell death incancer causes excessive growth .\\niv) Cancer cells lose properties of differentiation and thusperform little or no function .\\nv) Due to loss of growth controls, cancer cells are geneticallyunstable and develop newer mutations .\\nvi) Cancer cells overrun their neighbouring tissue and invade\\nlocally .\\nvii) Cancer cells have the ability to travel from the site oforigin to other sites in the body where they colonise andestablish distant metastasis .\\nCancer cells originate by clonal prolferation of a single\\nprogeny of a cell (monoclonality). Cancer  cells arise fromstem cells normally present in the tissues in small numberand are not readily identifiable. These stem cells have theproperties of prolonged self-renewal, asymmetric replicationand transdifferentiation (i.e. plasticity). These cancer stemcells are called tumour-initiating cells. Their definite existencein acute leukaemias has been known for sometime and havenow been found to be present in some other malignanttumours.\\nIII.  CLINICAL AND GROSS FEATURES\\nClinically,  benign tumours are generally slow growing, and\\ndepending upon the location, may remain asymptomatic (e.g.\\nsubcutaneous lipoma), or may produce serious symptoms(e.g. meningioma in the nervous system). On the other hand,malignant tumours  grow rapidly, may ulcerate on thesurface, invade locally into deeper tissues, may spread todistant sites (metastasis), and also produce systemic featuressuch as weight loss, anorexia and anemia.  In fact, two of thecardinal clinical features of malignant tumours are:invasiveness and metastasis (discussed later).\\nGross appearance  of benign and malignant tumours  may\\nbe quite variable and the features may not be diagnostic onthe basis of gross appearance alone. However, certaindistinctive features characterise almost all tumours comparedto neighbouring normal tissue of origin—they have adifferent colour, texture and consistency. Gross terms suchas papillary, fungating, infiltrating, haemorrhagic, ulcerativeand cystic are used to describe the macroscopic appearanceof the tumours. General gross features of benign andmalignant tumours are as under (Figs. 8.2 and 8.3):\\nBenign tumours  are generally spherical or ovoid in shape.\\nThey are encapsulated or well-circumscribed, freely movable,more often firm and uniform, unless secondary changes likehaemorrhage or infarction supervene (Fig. 8.2,A, E).\\nMalignant tumours,  on the other hand, are usually\\nirregular in shape, poorly-circumscribed and extend into theadjacent tissues. Secondary changes like haemorrhage,infarction and ulceration are seen more often. Sarcomastypically have fish-flesh like consistency while carcinomasare generally firm (Fig. 8.2,C, G).\\nIV.  MICROSCOPIC \\nFEATURES\\nFor recognising and classifying the tumours, the microscopiccharacteristics of tumour cells are of greatest importance.These features which are appreciated in histologic sectionsare as under:1.microscopic pattern;\\n2. cytomorphology of neoplastic cells (differentiation and\\nanaplasia);3.\\ntumour angiogenesis and stroma; and\\n4. inflammatory reaction.\\n1. Microscopic Pattern\\nThe tumour cells may be arranged in a variety of patterns in\\ndifferent tumours as under:\\nThe epithelial tumours  generally consist of acini, sheets,\\ncolumns or cords of epithelial tumour cells that may bearranged in solid or papillary pattern (Fig. 8.2,B, D) .\\nThe mesenchymal tumours  have mesenchymal tumour cells\\narranged as interlacing bundles, fasicles or whorls, lyingseparated from each other usually by the intercellular matrixsubstance such as hyaline material in leiomyoma (Fig. 8.2,E) ,\\ncartilaginous matrix in chondroma, osteoid in osteosarcoma,reticulin network in soft tissue sarcomas etc (Fig. 8.2,H) .\\nCertain tumours have mixed patterns  e.g. teratoma arising\\nfrom totipotent cells, pleomorphic adenoma of salivary gland(mixed salivary tumour), fibroadenoma of the breast,carcinosarcoma of the uterus and various other combinationsof tumour types.\\nHaematopoietic tumours  such as leukaemias and\\nlymphomas often have none or little stromal support.\\nGenerally, most benign tumours and low grade malignant\\ntumours reduplicate  the normal structure of origin more\\nclosely so that there is little difficulty in identifying and197CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia\\nclassifying such tumours (Fig. 8.2,B, F) . However, anaplastic\\ntumours differ greatly from the arrangement in normal tissue\\nof origin of the tumour and may occasionally pose problemsin classifying the tumour.\\n2. Cytomorphology of Neoplastic Cells\\n(Differentiation and Anaplasia)\\nThe neoplastic cell is characterised by morphologic and\\nfunctional alterations, the most significant of which are\\n‘differentiation’ and ‘anaplasia’.\\nDifferentiation  is defined as the extent of morphological\\nand functional resemblance of parenchymal tumour cells to\\ncorresponding normal cells. If the deviation of neoplastic cellin structure and function is minimal as compared to normalcell, the tumour is described as ‘well-differentiated’  such as\\nmost benign and low-grade malignant tumours. ‘Poorly\\ndifferentiated’, ‘undifferentiated’  or ‘dedifferentiated’  are\\nsynonymous terms for poor structural and functionalresemblance to corresponding normal cell.\\nAnaplasia is lack of differentiation and is a characteristic\\nfeature of most malignant tumours. Depending upon thedegree of differentiation, the extent of anaplasia is also\\nvariable i.e. poorly differentiated malignant tumours havehigh degree of anaplasia.\\nAs a result of anaplasia, noticeable morphological and\\nfunctional alterations in the neoplastic cells are observed.These are considered below and are diagrammaticallyillustrated in Fig. 8.4:\\ni) Loss of polarity.  Normally, the nuclei of epithelial cells are\\noriented along the basement membrane which is termed asbasal polarity. This property is based on cell adhesionmolecules, particularly selectins. Early in malignancy,tumour cells lose their basal polarity so that the nuclei tendto lie away from the basement membrane (Fig. 8.5) .\\nii) Pleomorphism.  The term pleomorphism means variation\\nin size and shape of the tumour cells. The extent of cellularpleomorphism generally correlates with the degree ofanaplasia. Tumour cells are often bigger than normal but insome tumours they can be of normal size or smaller than\\nnormal (Fig. 8.6) .\\niii) N:C ratio.  Generally, the nuclei of malignant tumour cells\\nshow more conspicuous changes. Nuclei are enlargedFigure 8.3 Gross appearance of a prototype of benign and malignant tumour.\\nFigure 8.4 Diagrammatic representation of cytomorphologic features of neoplastic cells. Characteristics of cancer (B) in a gland are contr asted\\nwith the appearance of an acinus (A).\\n198SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\ndisproportionate to the cell size so that the nucleocytoplasmic\\nratio is increased from normal 1:5 to 1:1 (Fig. 8.6) .\\niv) Anisonucleosis. Just like cellular pleomorphism, the nuclei\\ntoo, show variation in size and shape in malignant tumourcells (Fig. 8.6) .\\nv) Hyperchromatism. Characteristically, the nuclear\\nchromatin of malignant cell is increased and coarselyclumped. This is due to increase in the amount ofnucleoprotein resulting in dark-staining nuclei, referred toas hyperchromatism (Fig. 8.6) . Nuclear shape may vary,\\nnuclear membrane may be irregular and nuclear chromatinis clumped along the nuclear membrane.\\nvi) Nucleolar changes.  Malignant cells frequently have a\\nprominent nucleolus or nucleoli in the nucleus reflecting\\nincreased nucleoprotein synthesis (Fig. 8.6) . This may be\\ndemonstrated as Nucleolar Organiser Region  (NOR) bysilver (Ag) staining called AgNOR material.vii) Mitotic figures. The parenchymal cells of poorly-\\ndifferentiated tumours often show large number of mitosesas compared with benign tumours and well-differentiatedmalignant tumours. As stated above, these appear as eithernormal or abnormal mitotic figures (Fig. 8.7):\\nNormal mitotic figures may be seen in some non-neoplastic\\nproliferating cells (e.g. haematopoietic cells of the bonemarrow, intestinal epithelium, hepatocytes etc), in certainbenign tumours and some low grade malignant tumours; insections they are seen as a dark band of dividing chromatinat two poles of the nuclear spindle.\\nAbnormal or atypical mitotic figures are more important in\\nmalignant tumours and are identified as tripolar, quadripolarand multipolar spindles in malignant tumour cells.\\nviii) Tumour giant cells. Multinucleate  tumour giant cells  or\\ngiant cells containing a single large and bizarre nucleus,\\npossessing nuclear characters of the adjacent tumour cells,are another important feature of anaplasia in malignanttumours (Fig. 8.8) .\\nix) Functional  (Cytoplasmic) changes.  Structural anaplasia in\\ntumours is accompanied with functional anaplasia asappreciated from the cytoplasmic constituents of the tumourcells. The functional abnormality in neoplasms may bequantitative, qualitative, or both.\\nGenerally, benign tumours and better-differentiated\\nmalignant tumours continue to function well qualitatively,though there may be quantitative  abnormality in the product\\ne.g. large or small amount of collagen produced by benigntumours of fibrous tissue, keratin formation in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. In more anaplastictumours, there is usually quantitative fall in the productmade by the tumour cells e.g. absence of keratin in anaplasticsquamous cell carcinoma.\\nThere may be both qualitative and quantitative abnormality\\nof the cellular function in some anaplastic tumours e.g.multiple myeloma producing abnormal immunoglobulin inlarge quantities.Figure 8.5 Microscopic appearance of loss of nuclear polarity (B)\\ncontrasted with normal basal polarity in columnar epithelium (A). The\\nbasement membrane is intact in both.\\nFigure 8.6 Nuclear features of malignant cells in malignant\\nmelanoma—pleomorphism, anisonucleosis, increased N/C: ratio, nuclear\\nhyperchromatism and prominent nucleoli.Figure 8.7 Normal and abnormal (atypical) mitotic figures.\\n199CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia\\nEndocrine tumours may cause excessive hormone\\nproduction leading to characteristic clinical syndromes.\\nBesides the production of hormones by endocrine tumours,hormones or hormone-like substances may be produced bycertain tumours quite unrelated to the endocrine glands. Thisproperty of tumours is called ectopic hormone production  e.g.\\noat cell carcinoma of the lung can secrete ACTH and ADH;\\nless often it may produce gonadotropin, thyrotropin,\\nparathormone, calcitonin and growth hormone. Ectopicerythropoietin may be produced by carcinoma of kidneys,hepatocellular carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma.\\nx) Chromosomal abnormalities.  All tumour cells have abnor-\\nmal genetic composition and on division they transmit the\\ngenetic abnormality to their progeny. The chromosomalabnormalities are more marked in more malignant tumourswhich include deviations in both morphology and numberof chromosomes. Most malignant tumours show DNA aneu-\\nploidy , often in the form of an increase in the number of\\nchromosomes, reflected morphologically by the increase inthe size of nuclei.\\nOne of the most important examples of a consistent\\nchromosomal abnormality in human malignancy is the pre-sence of Philadelphia chromosome (named after the city inwhich it was first described) in 95% cases of chronic myeloidleukaemia. In this, part of the long arm of chromosome 9 istranslocated to part of the long arm of chromosome 22 (t 9;22). Other examples of neoplasms showing chromosomalabnormalities are Burkitt’s lymphoma, acute lymphoidleukaemia, multiple myeloma, retinoblastoma, oat cellcarcinoma, Wilms’ tumour etc.\\n3. Tumour Angiogenesis and Stroma\\nThe connective tissue alongwith its vascular network forms\\nthe supportive framework on which the parenchymal tumourcells grow and receive nourishment. In addition to variableamount of connective tissue and vascularity, the stroma mayhave nerves and metaplastic bone or cartilage but nolymphatics.\\nTUMOUR ANGIOGENESIS.  In order to provide nourish-\\nment to growing tumour, new blood vessels are formed frompre-existing ones (angiogenesis). How this takes place under\\nthe influence of angiogenic factors elaborated by tumour cellssuch as vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) isdiscussed later under molecular pathogenesis of cancer.However, related morphologic features are as under:i) Microvascular density.  The new capillaries add to the\\nvascular density of the tumour which has been used as amarker to assess the rate of growth of tumours and hencegrade the tumours. This is done by counting microvasculardensity  in the section of the tumour.\\nii) Central necrosis.  However, if the tumour outgrows its blood\\nsupply as occurs in rapidly growing tumours or tumourangiogenesis fails, its core undergoes ischaemic necrosis.\\nTUMOUR STROMA.  The collagenous tissue in the stroma\\nmay be scanty or excessive. In the former case, the tumour is\\nsoft and fleshy (e.g. in sarcomas, lymphomas), while in thelatter case the tumour is hard and gritty (e.g. infiltrating ductcarcinoma breast). Growth of fibrous tissue in tumour isstimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)elaborated by tumour cells.\\nIf the epithelial tumour is almost entirely composed of\\nparenchymal cells, it is called medullary e.g. medullary\\ncarcinoma of the breast (Fig. 8.9, A),  medullary carcinoma\\nof the thyroid.\\nIf there is excessive connective tissue stroma in the\\nepithelial tumour, it is referred to as desmoplasia  and the\\ntumour is hard or scirrhous e.g. infiltrating duct carcinoma\\nbreast (Fig. 8.9, B),  linitis plastica of the stomach.\\n4. Inflammatory Reaction\\nAt times, prominent inflammatory reaction is present in and\\naround the tumours. It could be the result of ulceration inthe cancer when there is secondary infection. Theinflammatory reaction in such instances may be acute orchronic. However, some tumours show chronic inflammatoryreaction, chiefly of lymphocytes, plasma cells andFigure 8.8 A multinulceate tumour giant cell in osteosarcoma.\\nFigure 8.9 Tumour stroma. A, Medullary carcinoma of breast, rich\\nin parenchymal cells. B, Scirrhous carcinoma of breast having abundant\\ncollagenised (desmopastic) stroma.\\n200SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nmacrophages, and in some instances granulomatous reaction,\\nin the absence of ulceration. This is due to cell-mediatedimmunologic response by the host in an attempt to destroythe tumour. In some cases, such an immune responseimproves the prognosis.\\nThe examples of such reaction are: seminoma testis\\n(Fig. 8.10),  malignant melanoma of the skin, lympho-\\nepithelioma of the throat, medullary carcinoma of the breast,choriocarcinoma, Warthin’s tumour of salivary glands etc.\\nV.  LOCAL INVASION (DIRECT SPREAD)\\nBENIGN TUMOURS.  Most benign tumours form\\nencapsulated or circumscribed masses that  expand and push\\naside the surrounding normal tissues without actually\\ninvading, infiltrating or metastasising.\\nMALIGNANT TUMOURS.  Malignant tumours also enlarge\\nby expansion and some well-differentiated tumours may be\\npartially encapsulated as well e.g. follicular carcinomathyroid. But characteristically, they are distinguished frombenign tumours by invasion,  infiltration and destruction  of the\\nsurrounding tissue, besides distant metastasis (describedbelow). In general, tumours invade via the route of leastresistance, though eventually most cancers recognise noanatomic boundaries. Often, cancers extend through tissuespaces, permeate lymphatics, blood vessels, perineuralspaces and may penetrate a bone by growing throughnutrient foramina. More commonly, the tumours invade thin-walled capillaries and veins than thick-walled arteries. Densecompact collagen, elastic tissue and cartilage are some of thetissues which are sufficiently resistant to invasion bytumours.\\nMechanism of invasion of malignant tumours is discussed\\ntogether with that of metastasis below.\\nVI.  METASTASIS (DISTANT SPREAD)\\nMetastasis ( meta = transformation, stasis = residence) is\\ndefined as spread of tumour by invasion in such a way thatdiscontinuous secondary tumour mass/masses are formed\\nat the site of lodgement. Metastasis and invasiveness are the\\ntwo most important features to distinguish malignant from benigntumours: benign tumours do not metastasise while all the\\nmalignant tumours with a few exceptions like gliomas of thecentral nervous system and basal cell carcinoma of the skin,can metastasise. Generally, larger, more aggressive andrapidly-growing tumours are more likely to metastasise butthere are numerous exceptions. About one-third of malignanttumours at presentation have evident metastatic depositswhile another 20% have occult metastasis.\\nRoutes of Metastasis\\nCancers may spread to distant sites by following pathways:\\n1.Lymphatic spread\\n2. Haematogenous spread3.\\nSpread along body cavities and natural passages\\n(Transcoelomic spread, along epithelium-lined surfaces,spread via cerebrospinal fluid, implantation).\\n1. LYMPHATIC SPREAD.  In general, carcinomas metastasise\\nby lymphatic route while sarcomas favour haematogenous route.\\nHowever, sarcomas may also spread by lymphatic pathway.The involvement of lymph nodes by malignant cells may beof two forms:\\ni) Lymphatic permeation. The walls of lymphatics are readily\\ninvaded by cancer cells and may form a continuous growth\\nin the lymphatic channels called lymphatic permeation.\\nii) Lymphatic emboli.  Alternatively, the malignant cells may\\ndetach to form tumour emboli so as to be carried along the\\nlymph to the next draining lymph node. The tumour embolienter the lymph node at its convex surface and are lodged inthe subcapsular sinus where they start growing (Fig. 8.11).\\nLater, of course, the whole lymph node may be replaced andenlarged by the metastatic tumour (Fig. 8.12) .\\nGenerally, regional lymph nodes draining the tumour are\\ninvariably involved producing regional nodal metastasis e.g.\\nfrom carcinoma breast to axillary lymph nodes, fromcarcinoma thyroid to lateral cervical lymph nodes,bronchogenic carcinoma to hilar and para-tracheal lymphnodes etc.\\nHowever, all regional nodal enlargements are not due to\\nnodal metastasis because necrotic products of tumour andantigens may also incite regional lymphadenitis of sinus\\nhistiocytosis.\\nSometimes lymphatic metastases do not develop first in\\nthe lymph node nearest to the tumour because of venous-lymphatic anastomoses or due to obliteration of lymphaticsby inflammation or radiation, so called skip metastasis.\\nOther times, due to obstruction of the lymphatics by\\ntumour cells, the lymph flow is disturbed and tumour cellsspread against the flow of lymph causing  retrograde metastases\\nat unusual sites e.g. metastasis of carcinoma prostate to thesupraclavicular lymph nodes, metastatic deposits frombronchogenic carcinoma to the axillary lymph nodes.\\nVirchow’s lymph node  is nodal metastasis preferentially\\nto supraclavicular lymph node from cancers of abdominalorgans e.g. cancer stomach, colon, and gall bladder.Figure 8.10 Inflammatory reaction in the stroma of the tumour. A,\\nLymphocytic reaction in seminoma testis. B, Granulomatous reaction\\n(thick arrow) in Hodgkin’s lymphoma (thin arrow for RS cell).\\n201CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia\\nIt is believed that lymph nodes in the vicinity of tumour\\nperform multiple roles—as initial barrier filter, and in\\ndestruction of tumour cells, while later provide fertile soilfor growth of tumour cells.\\nMechanism of lymphatic route of metastasis is discussed\\nlater under biology of invasion and metastasis.\\n2. HAEMATOGENOUS SPREAD.  Blood-borne metastasis is\\nthe common route for sarcomas but certain carcinomas also\\nfrequently metastasise by this mode,  especially those of the lung,\\nbreast, thyroid, kidney, liver, prostate and ovary. The siteswhere blood-borne metastasis commonly occurs are: theliver, lungs, brain, bones, kidney and adrenals, all of whichprovide ‘good soil’ for the growth of ‘good seeds’ ( seed-soil\\ntheory ). However, a few organs such as spleen, heart, and\\nskeletal muscle generally do not allow tumour metastasis togrow. Spleen is unfavourable site due to open sinusoidalpattern which does not permit tumour cells to stay there longenough to produce metastasis. In general, only a proportionof cancer cells are capable of clonal proliferation in the properenvironment; others die without establishing a metastasis.\\nSystemic veins  drain blood into vena cavae from limbs,\\nhead and neck and pelvis. Therefore, cancers of these sitesmore often metastasise to the lungs.\\nPortal veins  drain blood from the bowel, spleen and\\npancreas into the liver. Thus, tumours of these organsfrequently have secondaries in the liver.\\nArterial spread of tumours is less likely because they are\\nthick-walled and contain elastic tissue which is resistant toinvasion. Nevertheless, arterial spread may occur whentumour cells pass through pulmonary capillary bed orthrough pulmonary arterial branches which have thin walls.Cancer of the lung may, however, metastasise by pulmonaryarterial route to kidneys, adrenals, bones, brain etc.\\nRetrograde spread  by blood route may occur at unusual\\nsites due to retrograde spread after venous obstruction, justFigure 8.11 Regional nodal metastasis. A, Axillary nodes involved by carcinoma breast. B, Hilar and para-tracheal lymph nodes involved by\\nbronchogenic carcinoma. C, Lymphatic spread begins by lodgement of tumour cells in subcapsular sinus via afferent lymphatics en tering at the\\nconvex surface of the lymph node.\\nFigure 8.12 Metastatic carcinoma in lymph nodes.

Sectioned surface shows\\nmerging capsules of lymph nodes and replacement of grey brown tissue of nodes by large grey white areas of tumour. B, Masses of malignant cells\\nare seen in the subcapsular sinus and extending into the underlying nodal tissue.\\n202SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nas with lymphatic metastases. Important examples are\\nvertebral metastases in cancers of the thyroid and prostate.\\nGrossly,  blood-borne metastases in an organ appear as\\nmultiple, rounded nodules of varying size, scatteredthroughout the organ (Fig. 8.13).  Sometimes, the\\nmetastasis may grow bigger than the primary tumour. Attimes, metastatic deposits may come to attention firstwithout an evident primary tumour. In such cases searchfor primary tumour may be rewarding, but rarely theprimary tumour may remain undetected or occult.Metastatic deposits just like primary tumour may causefurther dissemination via lymphatics and blood vessels(Fig. 8.14, A).Microscopically,  the secondary deposits generally\\nreproduce the structure of primary tumour (Fig. 8.14, B).\\nHowever, the same primary tumour on metastasis atdifferent sites may show varying grades of differentiation,apparently due to the influence of local environmentsurrounding the tumour for its growth.\\n3. SPREAD ALONG BODY CAVITIES AND NATURALPASSAGES.  Uncommonly, some cancers may spread by\\nseeding  across body cavities and natural passages. These\\nroutes of distant spread are as under:\\ni) Transcoelomic spread.  Certain cancers invade through\\nthe serosal wall of the coelomic cavity so that tumourFigure 8.13 Gross appearance of haematogenous metastases at common sites.\\nFigure 8.14 Metastatic sarcoma lung.

B, Microscopic appearance of pulmonary metastat ic deposits\\nfrom sarcoma.\\n203CHAPTER 8 Neoplasiafragments or clusters of tumour cells break off to be carried\\nin the coelomic fluid and are implanted elsewhere in the body\\ncavity. Peritoneal cavity is involved most often, but\\noccasionally pleural and pericardial cavities are also affected.A few examples of transcoelomic spread are as follows:a) Carcinoma of the stomach  seeding to both ovaries\\n(Krukenberg tumour).b) Carcinoma of the ovary spreading to the entire peritoneal\\ncavity without infiltrating the underlying organs.c) Pseudomyxoma peritonei  is the gelatinous coating of the\\nperitoneum from mucin-secreting carcinoma of the ovary orapppendix.d) Carcinoma of the bronchus and breast  seeding to the pleura\\nand pericardium.\\nii) Spread along epithelium-lined surfaces.  It is unusual\\nfor a malignant tumour to spread along the epithelium-lined\\nsurfaces because intact epithelium and mucus coat are quite\\nresistant to penetration by tumour cells. However,exceptionally a malignant tumour may spread through:a) the fallopian tube from the endometrium to the ovaries or\\nvice-versa;\\nb) through the bronchus into alveoli; andc) through the ureters from the kidneys into lower urinarytract.\\niii) Spread via cerebrospinal fluid.  Malignant tumour of the\\nependyma and leptomeninges may spread by release of\\ntumour fragments and tumour cells into the CSF and produce\\nmetastases at other sites in the central nervous system.\\niv) Implantation.  Rarely, a tumour may spread by\\nimplantation by surgeon’s scalpel, needles, sutures, or may\\nbe implanted by direct contact such as transfer of cancer ofthe lower lip to the apposing upper lip.\\nMECHANISM AND BIOLOGY OF\\nINVASION AND \\nMETASTASIS\\nThe process of local invasion and distant spread by lymphaticand haematogenous routes discussed above involves passagethrough barriers before gaining access to the vascular lumen.This includes making the passage by the cancer cells bydissolution of extracellular matrix (ECM) at three levels— atthe basement membrane of tumour itself, at the level ofinterstitial connective tissue, and at the basement membraneof microvasculature. The following steps are involved at themolecular level which are schematically illustrated inFig. 8.15.\\n1.Aggressive clonal proliferation and angiogenesis.  The\\nfirst step in the spread of cancer cells is the development of\\nrapidly proliferating clone of cancer cells. This is explainedon the basis of tumour heterogeneity , i.e. in the population of\\nmonoclonal tumour cells, a subpopulation or clone of tumourcells has the right biologic characteristics to complete thesteps involved in the development of metastasis. Tumourangiogenesis plays a very significant role in metastasis sincethe new vessels formed as part of growing tumour are morevulnerable to invasion as these evolving vessels are directlyin contact with cancer cells.2. Tumour cell loosening. Normal cells remain glued to\\neach other due to presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)i.e.E (epithelial)-cadherin. In epithelial cancers, there is eitherloss or inactivation of E-cadherin and also other CAMs ofimmunoglobulin superfamily, all of which results inloosening of cancer cells.\\n3.Tumour cell-ECM interaction.  Loosened cancer cells are\\nnow attached to ECM proteins, mainly laminin  and fibronectin .\\nThis attachment is facilitated due to profoundness of\\nreceptors on the cancer cells for both these proteins. There isalso loss of integrins , the transmembrane receptors, further\\nfavouring invasion.\\nFigure 8.15 Mechanism and biology of local invasion and\\nmetastasis. The serial numbers in the figure correspond to their\\ndescription in the text.\\n204SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques4. Degradation of ECM.  Tumour cells overexpress proteases\\nand matrix-degrading enzymes, metalloproteinases, that\\nincludes collagenases and gelatinase, while the inhibitors of\\nmetalloproteinases are decreased. Another protease,cathepsin D, is also increased in certain cancers. Theseenzymes bring about dissolution of ECM—firstly basementmembrane of tumour itself, then make way for tumour cellsthrough the interstitial matrix, and finally dissolve thebasement membrane of the vessel wall.\\n5. Entry of tumour cells into capillary lumen.  The tumour\\ncells after degrading the basement membrane are ready to\\nmigrate into lumen of capillaries or venules for which thefollowing mechanisms play a role:i) Autocrine motility factor (AMF)  is a cytokine derived from\\ntumour cells and stimulates receptor-mediated motility oftumour cells.i\\ni) Cleavage products of matrix components which are formed\\nfollowing degradation of ECM have properties of tumourcell chemotaxis, growth promotion and angiogenesis in thecancer.\\nAfter the malignant cells have migrated through the\\nbreached basement membrane, these cells enter the lumenof  lymphatic and capillary channels.\\n6. Thrombus formation.  The tumour cells protruding in the\\nlumen of the capillary are now covered with constituents of\\nthe circulating blood and form the thrombus. Thrombusprovides nourishment to the tumour cells and also protectsthem from the immune attack by the circulating host cells.In fact, normally a large number of tumour cells are releasedinto circulation but they are attacked by the host immunecells. Actually a very small proportion of malignant cells (lessthan 0.1%) in the blood stream survive to develop intometastasis.\\n7. Extravasation of tumour cells. Tumour cells in the\\ncirculation (capillaries, venules, lymphatics) may\\nmechanically block these vascular channels and attach tovascular endothelium. In this way, the sequence similar tolocal invasion is repeated and the basement membrane inexposed.\\n8. Survival and growth of metastatic deposit. The extra-\\nvasated malignant cells on lodgement in the right\\nenvironment grow further under the influence of growthfactors produced by host tissues, tumour cells and bycleavage products of matrix components. These growthfactors in particular include: PDGF, FGF, TGF- β and VEGF.\\nThe metastatic deposits grow further if the host immunedefense mechanism fails to eliminate it. Metastatic depositsmay further metastasise to the same organ or to other sitesby forming emboli.\\nPROGNOSTIC MARKERS\\nMetastasis is a common event in malignant tumours which\\ngreatly reduces the survival of patient. In the biology oftumour, metastasis is a form of unusual cell differentiationin which the tumour cells form disorderly masses at ectopicsites and start growing there. This random phenomenontakes place in a stepwise manner involving only asubpopulation of tumour cells selectively. The process isgoverned by inappropriate expression of genes which normally\\npartake in physiologic processes  i.e. it is a genetically prog -\\nrammed phenomenon.\\nRecent evidence has shown that in metastatic tumours,\\nsurvival of host is correlated with some clinical and molecularfeatures of tumours which act as prognostic markers.  These\\nare as under:\\ni\\n) Clinical prognostic markers:  Size, grade, vascular\\ninvasion and nodal involvement by the tumour.\\nii) Molecular prognostic markers:  Molecular markers indi-\\ncative of poor prognosis in certain specific tumours are:\\na) expression of an oncogene by tumour cells (C-met) ;\\nb) CD 44 molecule;c) oestrogen receptors;d) epidermal growth factor receptor;e) angiogenesis factors and degree of neovascularisation;andf) expression of metastasis associated gene or nucleic acid\\n(MAGNA) in the DNA fragment in metastasising tumour.\\nGRADING AND STAGING OF CANCER\\n‘Grading’ and ‘staging’ are the two systems to predict tumour\\nbehaviour and guide therapy after a malignant tumour isdetected. Grading is defined as the gross and microscopic degree\\nof differentiation of the tumour, while staging means extent ofspread of the tumour within the patient. Thus, grading is\\nhistologic while staging is clinical.\\nGrading\\nCancers may be graded grossly and microscopically. Gross\\nfeatures like exophytic or fungating appearance areindicative of less malignant growth than diffusely infiltratingtumours. However, grading is largely based on 2 importanthistologic features: the degree of anaplasia, and the rate of growth.\\nBased on these features, cancers are categorised fromgrade I as the most differentiated, to grade III or IV as themost undifferentiated or anaplastic. Many systems of gradinghave been proposed but the one described by Broders  for\\ndividing squamous cell carcinoma into 4 grades dependingupon the degree of differentiation is followed for othermalignant tumours as well. Broders’ grading  is as under:\\nGrade I:  Well-differentiated (less than 25% anaplastic cells).\\nGrade II:  Moderately-differentiated (25-50% anaplastic cells).\\nGrade III:  Moderately-differentiated (50-75% anaplastic cells).\\nGrade IV:  Poorly-differentiated or anaplastic (more than 75%\\nanaplastic cells).\\nHowever, grading of tumours has several shortcomings.\\nIt is subjective and the degree of differentiation may varyfrom one area of tumour to the other. Therefore, it is commonpractice with pathologists to grade cancers in descriptiveterms (e.g. well-differentiated, undifferentiated, keratinising,non-keratinising etc) rather than giving the tumours gradenumbers.\\nMore objective criteria for histologic grading include use\\nof flow cytometry for mitotic cell counts, cell proliferation205CHAPTER 8 Neoplasiamarkers  by immunohistochemistry, and by applying image\\nmorphometry for cancer cell and nuclear parameters.\\nStaging\\nThe extent of spread of cancers can be assessed by 3 ways—\\nby clinical examination, by investigations, and by pathologicexamination of the tissue removed. Two important stagingsystems currently followed are: TNM staging and AJCstaging.\\nTNM staging.  (T for primary tumour, N for regional nodal\\ninvolvement, and M for distant metastases) was developed\\nby the UICC (Union Internationale Contre Cancer, Geneva).\\nFor each of the 3 components namely T, N and M, numbersare added to indicate the extent of involvement, as under:\\nT\\n0 to T4: In situ  lesion to largest and most extensive\\nprimary tumour.\\nN0 to N3: No nodal involvement to widespread lymph\\nnode involvement.\\nM0 to M2: No metastasis to disseminated haematogenous\\nmetastases.\\nAJC staging.  American Joint Committee staging divides all\\ncancers into stage 0 to IV, and takes into account all the\\n3 components of the preceding system (primary tumour,nodal involvement and distant metastases) in each stage.\\nTNM and AJC staging systems can be applied for staging\\nmost malignant tumours.\\nCurrently, clinical staging of tumours does not rest on\\nroutine radiography (X-ray, ultrasound) and exploratorysurgery but more modern techniques are available by whichit is possible to ‘stage’ a malignant tumour by non-invasivetechniques. These include use of computed tomography (CT)and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan based on tissuedensity for locating the local extent of tumour and its spreadto other organs. More recently, availability of positronemission tomography (PET) scan has overcome the limitationof CT and MRI scan because PET scan facilitates distinctionof benign and malignant tumour on the basis of biochemicaland molecular processes in tumours. Radioactive tracerstudies in vivo such as use of iodine isotope 125 bound tospecific tumour antibodies is another method by which smallnumber of tumour cells in the body can be detected byimaging of tracer substance bound to specific tumour antigen.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY AND\\nPREDISPOSITION TO NEOPLASIA\\nCANCER INCIDENCE\\nThe overall incidence of cancer in a population or a country\\nis known by registration of all cancer cases (cancer registry)and by rate of death from cancer. Worldwide, it is estimatedthat about 20% of all deaths are cancer-related; in US, canceris the second most common cause of deaths, next to heartdisease. There have been changing patterns in incidence ofcancers in both the sexes and in different geographic locationsas outlined below. Table 8.3 shows worldwide incidence (in\\ndescending order) of different forms of cancer in men,women, and children. As evident from the Table, some typesof cancers are more common in India while others arecommoner in the Western populations since etiologic factorsare different.\\nIn general, most common cancers in the developed and\\ndeveloping countries are as under:\\nDeveloped world: lung, breast, prostate and colorectal.\\nDeveloping world:  liver, cervical and oesophageal.\\nAbout one-third of all cancers worldwide are attributed\\nto 9 modifiable life-style factors : tobacco use, alcohol\\nconsumption, obesity, physical inactivity, low fiber diet,unprotected sex, polluted air, indoor household smoke, andcontaminated injections. Overall, there has been a decliningtrend in incidence of some of the cancers due to cancerscreening programmes for cervical, breast, colorectal andprostate cancer.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGIC FACTORS\\nA lot of clinical and experimental research and epidemio-\\nlogical studies have been carried out in the field of oncologyso as to know the possible causes of cancer and mechanismsinvolved in transformation of a normal cell into a neoplasticcell. It is widely known that no single factor is responsiblefor development of tumours. The role of some factors incausation of neoplasia is established while that of others isepidemiological and many others are still unknown.\\nBesides the etiologic role of some agents discussed later,\\nthe pattern and incidence of cancer depends upon thefollowing:A)A large number of  predisposing epidemiologic factors or\\ncofactors which include a number of endogenous host factors\\nand exogenous environmental factors.B)Chronic non-neoplastic (pre-malignant) conditions.\\nC)Role of hormones in cancer.\\nA\\n. Predisposing Factors\\n1.FAMILIAL AND GENETIC FACTORS.  It has long been\\nsuspected that familial predisposition and heredity play arole in the development of cancers. In general, the risk ofdeveloping cancer in relatives of a known cancer patient isalmost three times higher as compared to control subjects.Some of the cancers with familial occurrence are colon, breast,ovary, brain and melanoma. Familial cancers occur at arelatively early age, appear at multiple sites and occur in 2or more close relatives. The overall estimates suggest thatgenetic cancers comprise not greater than 5% of all cancers.Some of the common examples are as under:\\ni)Retinoblastoma.  About 40% of retinoblastomas are\\nfamilial and show an autosomal dominant inheritance.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.3. Five Most Common Primary Cancers in the World.\\nMen Women Children (Under 20)\\n1. Lung Breast Acute leukaemia\\n(oral cavity in India)\\n(cervix in India)\\n2. Prostate Lung CNS tumour\\n3. Colorectal Colorectal Bone sarcoma\\n4. Urinary bladder Endometrial Endocrine\\n5. Lymphoma Lymphoma Soft tissue sarcoma206SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesiv) South-East Asians,  especially of Chinese origin develop\\nnasopharyngeal cancer more commonly.\\nv) Indians  of both sexes have higher incidence of carcinoma\\nof the oral cavity and upper aerodigestive tract, while in\\nfemales carcinoma of uterine cervix and of the breast runparallel in incidence. Cancer of the liver in India is more oftendue to viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV) and subsequentcirrhosis, while in western populations it is more often dueto alcoholic cirrhosis.\\n3. ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS.\\nSurprising as it may seem, we are surrounded by anenvironment of carcinogens which we eat, drink, inhale andtouch. Some of the examples are given below:\\ni)Cigarette smoking  is the single most important environ-\\nmental factor implicated in the etiology of cancer of the oral\\ncavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, lungs, pancreas andurinary bladder.\\ni\\ni) Alcohol abuse  predisposes to the development of cancer\\nof oropharynx, larynx, oesophagus and liver.\\niii)Alcohol and tobacco together  further accentuate the risk\\nof developing cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract.\\niv) Cancer of the cervix  is linked to a number of factors such\\nas age at first coitus, frequency of coitus, multiplicity of\\npartners, parity etc. Sexual partners of circumcised maleshave lower incidence of cervical cancer than the partners ofuncircumcised males.\\nv) Penile cancer  is rare in the Jews and Muslims as they are\\ncustomarily circumcised. Carcinogenic component of\\nsmegma appears to play a role in the etiology of penile cancer.\\nvi) Betel nut cancer  of the cheek and tongue is quite common\\nin some parts of India due to habitual practice of keeping\\nthe bolus of paan  in a particular place in mouth for a long\\ntime.\\nvii) A large number of industrial and environmental\\nsubstances  are carcinogenic and are occupational hazard for\\nsome populations. These include exposure to substances like\\narsenic, asbestos, benzene, vinyl chloride, naphthylamine etc.\\nviii) Certain constituents of diet  have also been implicated\\nin the causation of cancer. Overweight individuals, deficiency\\nof vitamin A and people consuming diet rich in animal fatsand low in fibre content are more at risk of developing certaincancers such as colonic cancer. Diet rich in vitamin E, on theother hand, possibly has some protective influence by itsantioxidant action.\\n4. AGE.  The most significant risk factor for cancer is age.\\nGenerally, cancers occur in older individuals past 5th decade\\nof life (two-third of all cancers occur above 65 years of age),though there are variations in age incidence in different formsof cancers. It is not clear whether higher incidence of cancerin advanced age is due to alteration in the cells of the host,longer exposure to the effect of carcinogen, or decreasedability of the host immune response. Some tumours havetwo peaks of incidence e.g. acute leukaemias occur in childrenand in older age group. The biologic behaviour of tumoursin children does not always correlate with histologic features.Carriers of such genetic composition have 10,000 times higherrisk of developing retinoblastoma which is often bilateral.Such patients are predisposed to develop another primarymalignant tumour, notably osteogenic sarcoma.\\nFamilial form of retinoblastoma is due to missing of a\\nportion of chromosome 13 where RB gene is normally located.\\nThis results in a genetic defect of absence of RB gene, the\\nfirst ever tumour suppressor gene identified. An absent RB\\ngene predisposes an individual to retinoblastoma but cancerdevelops when other copy of RB gene from the other parent\\nis also defective.\\nii)\\nFamilial polyposis coli.  This condition has autosomal\\ndominant inheritance. The polypoid adenomas may be seen\\nat birth or in early age. By the age of 50 years, almost 100%cases of familial polyposis coli develop cancer of the colon.\\niii)Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN).  A combination of\\nadenomas of pituitary, parathyroid and pancreatic islets\\n(MEN-I) or syndrome of medullary carcinoma thyroid,pheochromocytoma and parathyroid tumour (MEN-II) areencountered in families.\\niv) Neurofibromatosis or von Recklinghausen’s disease.\\nThis condition is characterised by multiple neurofibromasand pigmented skin spots ( cafe au lait spots ). These patients\\nhave family history consistent with autosomal dominantinheritance in 50% of patients.\\nv) Cancer of the breast.  Female relatives of breast cancer\\npatients have 2 to 6 times higher risk of developing breast\\ncancer. Inherited breast cancer comprises about 5-10% of allbreast cancers. As discussed later, there are two breast cancersusceptibility genes, BRCA-1  and BRCA-2 . Mutations in these\\ngenes appear in about 3% cases and these patients have about85% risk of development of breast cancer.\\nvi) DNA-chromosomal instability syndromes.  These are a\\ngroup of pre-neoplastic conditions having defect in DNA\\nrepair mechanism. A classical example is xerodermapigmentosum, an autosomal recessive disorder,characterised by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.The patients may develop various types of skin cancers suchas basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma andmalignant melanoma.\\n2. RACIAL AND GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS.  Differences\\nin racial incidence of some cancers may be partly attributed\\nto the role of genetic composition but are largely due toinfluence of the environment and geographic differencesaffecting the whole population such as climate, soil, water,diet, habits, customs etc. Some of the examples of racial andgeographic variations in various cancers are as under:\\ni)White Europeans and Americans  develop most\\ncommonly malignancies of the lung, breast, and colon. Liver\\ncancer is uncommon in these races. Breast cancer isuncommon in Japanese women but is more common inAmerican women.\\ni\\ni) Black Africans,  on the other hand, have more commonly\\ncancers of the skin, penis, cervix and liver.\\niii)Japanese have  five times higher incidence of carcinoma\\nof the stomach than the Americans.207CHAPTER 8 NeoplasiaBesides acute leukaemias, other tumours in infancy and\\nchildhood  are: neuroblastoma, nephroblastoma (Wilms’\\ntumour), retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyo-\\nsarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, teratoma and CNS tumours.\\n5. SEX.   Apart from the malignant tumours of organs\\npeculiar to each sex, most tumours are generally more\\ncommon in men than in women except cancer of the breast,gall bladder, thyroid and hypopharynx. Although there aregeographic and racial variations, cancer of the breast  is the\\ncommonest cancer in women  throughout the world while lung\\ncancer  is the commonest cancer in men.  The differences in\\nincidence of certain cancers in the two sexes may be relatedto the presence of specific sex hormones.\\nB. Chronic Non-neoplastic (Pre-malignant)  Conditions\\nPremalignant lesions are a group of conditions which\\npredispose to the subsequent development of cancer. Suchconditions are important to recognise so as to prevent thesubsequent occurrence of an invasive cancer. Many of theseconditions are characterised by morphologic changes in thecells such as increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio,pleomorphism of cells and nuclei, increased mitotic activity,poor differentiation, and sometimes accompanied by chronicinflammatory cells.\\nSome examples of premalignant lesions are given below:\\n1. Carcinoma in situ  (intraepithelial neoplasia).  When the\\ncytological features of malignancy are present but themalignant cells are confined to epithelium without invasionacross the basement membrane, it is called as carcinomain situ or intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The common sites\\nare as under:i) Uterine cervix at the junction of ecto -\\n and endocervix\\n(Fig. 8.16)ii) Bowen’s disease of the skiniii) Actinic or solar keratosisiv)\\nOral leukoplakia\\nv) Intralobular and intraductal carcinoma of the breast.\\nThe area involved in carcinoma in situ  may be single and\\nsmall, or multifocal. As regards the behaviour of CIN, it mayregress and return to normal or may develop into invasivecancer. In some instances such as in cervical cancer, there isa sequential transformation from squamous metaplasia, toepithelial dysplasia, to carcinoma in situ, and eventually to\\ninvasive cancer.\\n2. Some benign tumours.  Commonly, benign tumours do\\nnot become malignant. However, there are some exceptions\\ne.g.i) Multiple villous adenomas of the large intestine have high\\nincidence of developing adenocarcinoma.ii\\n) Neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen’s disease) may\\ndevelop into sarcoma.\\n3. Miscellaneous conditions.  Certain inflammatory and\\nhyperplastic conditions are prone to development of cancer,\\ne.g.i)Patients of long-standing ulcerative colitis are predis-\\nposed to develop colorectal cancer.ii)\\nCirrhosis of the liver has predisposition to develop\\nhepatocellular carcinoma.iii)Chronic bronchitis in heavy cigarette smokers may\\ndevelop cancer of the bronchus.iv) Chronic irritation from jagged tooth or ill-fitting denturemay lead to cancer of the oral cavity.v) Squamous cell carcinoma developing in an old burn scar(Marjolin’s ulcer).\\nC. Hormones and Cancer\\nCancer is more likely to develop in organs and tissues which\\nundergo proliferation under the influence of excessive\\nhormonal stimulation. On cessation of hormonal stimulation,such tissues become atrophic. Hormone-sensitive tissuesdeveloping tumours are the breast, endometrium,\\nmyometrium, vagina, thyroid, liver, prostate and testis. Some\\nexamples of hormones influencing carcinogenesis inexperimental animals and humans are given below:\\n1. OESTROGEN.  Examples of oestrogen-induced cancers\\nare as under:\\ni) In experimental animals.  Induction of breast cancer in\\nmice by administration of high-dose of oestrogen and\\nreduction of the tumour development following oophorec-\\ntomy is the most important example. It has been known that\\nassociated infection with mouse mammary tumour virus(MMTV, Bittner milk factor ) has an added influence on the\\ndevelopment of breast cancer in mice. Other cancers which\\ncan be experimentally induced in mice by oestrogens are\\nsquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, connective tissuetumour of the myometrium, Leydig cell tumour of the testisin male mice, tumour of the kidney in hamsters, and benign\\nas well as malignant tumours of the liver in rats.\\nii\\n) In humans.  Women receiving oestrogen therapy and\\nwomen with oestrogen-secreting granulosa cell tumour of\\nthe ovary have increased risk of developing endometrialcarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma of the vagina is seen with\\nincreased frequency in adolescent daughters of mothers who\\nhad received oestrogen therapy during pregnancy.Figure 8.16 Carcinoma in situ  of uterine cervix. The atypical\\ndysplastic squamous cells are confined to all the layers of the mucosa\\nbut the basement membrane on which these layers rest is intact.\\n208SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques2. CONTRACEPTIVE HORMONES.  The sequential types\\nof oral contraceptives increase the risk of developing breast\\ncancer. Other tumours showing a slightly increasedfrequency in women receiving contraceptive pills for longdurations are benign tumours of the liver, and a few patientshave been reported to have developed hepatocellularcarcinoma.\\n3. ANABOLIC STEROIDS.  Consumption of anabolic\\nsteroids by athletes to increase the muscle mass is not only\\nunethical athletic practice but also increases the risk ofdeveloping benign and malignant tumours of the liver.\\n4. HORMONE-DEPENDENT TUMOURS.  It has been\\nshown in experimental animals that induction of hyper-\\nfunction of adenohypophysis is associated with increasedrisk of developing neoplasia of the target organs followingpreceding functional hyperplasia. There is tumour regressionon removal of the stimulus for excessive hormonal secretion.A few examples of such phenomena are seen in humans:i)Prostatic cancer  usually responds to the administration of\\noestrogens.ii)Breast cancer  may regress with oophorectomy, hypo-\\nphysectomy or on administration of male hormones.iii)Thyroid cancer  may slow down in growth with adminis-\\ntration of thyroxine that suppresses the secretion of TSH bythe pituitary.\\nCARCINOGENESIS: ETIOLOGY AND\\nPATHOGENESIS OF CANCER\\nCarcinogenesis or oncogenesis or tumorigenesis means\\nmechanism of induction of tumours ( pathogenesis of cancer );\\nagents which can induce tumours are called carcinogens\\n(etiology of cancer ). Since the time first ever carcinogen was\\nidentified, there has been ever-increasing list of agentsimplicated in etiology of cancer. There has been still greateraccumulation in volumes of knowledge on pathogenesis ofcancer, especially due to tremendous strides made in the fieldof molecular biology and genetics in recent times.\\nThe subject of etiology and pathogenesis of cancer is\\ndiscussed under the following 4 broad headings:A. Molecular pathogenesis of cancer (genes and cancer)B. Chemical carcinogens and chemical carcinogenesisC. Physical carcinogens and radiation carcinogenesisD. Biologic carcinogens and viral oncogenesis.\\nA. MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS OF CANCER\\n(GENETIC MECHANISMS OF CANCER)\\nBasic Concept of Molecular Pathogenesis\\nThe mechanism as to how a normal cell is transformed to a\\ncancer cell is complex. At different times, attempts have beenmade to unravel this mystery by various mechanisms.Currently, a lot of literature has accumulated to explain thepathogenesis of cancer at molecular level. The generalconcept of molecular mechanisms of cancer is briefly outlinedbelow and diagrammatically shown in Fig. 8.17.\\n1.Monoclonality of tumours.  There is strong evidence to\\nsupport that most human cancers arise from a single cloneof cells by genetic transformation or mutation. For example:i)In a case of multiple myeloma (a malignant disorder of\\nplasma cells), there is production of a single type of immuno-globulin or its chain as seen by monoclonal spike in serumelectrophoresis.ii)\\nDue to inactivation of one of the two X-chromosomes in\\nfemales (paternal or maternal derived), women are mosaicswith two types of cell populations for glucose-6-phosphatasedehydrogenase (G6PD) isoenzyme  A and B.  It is observedthat all the tumour cells in benign uterine tumours(leiomyoma) contain either A or B genotype of G6PD (i.e.the tumour cells are derived from a single progenitor cloneof cell), while the normal myometrial cells are mosaic of bothtypes of cells derived from A as well as B isoenzyme(Fig. 8.18).\\n2.Field theory of cancer.  In an organ developing cancer, in\\nthe backdrop of normal cells, limited number of cells only\\ngrow in to cancer after undergoing sequence of changesunder the influence of etiologic agents. This is termed as ‘fieldeffect’ and the concept called as field theory of cancer.\\n3. Multi-step process of cancer growth and progression.\\nCarcinogenesis is a gradual multi-step process involving\\nmany generations of cells. The various causes may act onthe cell one after another ( multi-hit process ). The same process\\nis also involved in further progression of the tumour.\\nFigure 8.17 Schematic illustration to show molecular basis of cancer.\\n209CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia\\nUltimately, the cells so formed are genetically and\\nphenotypically transformed cells having phenotypic featuresof malignancy—excessive growth, invasiveness and distantmetastasis.\\n4. Genetic theory of cancer. Cell growth of normal as well\\nas abnormal types is under genetic control. In cancer, there\\nare either genetic abnormalities in the cell, or there are normalgenes with abnormal expression. The abnormalities in geneticcomposition may be from inherited or induced mutations(induced by etiologic carcinogenic agents namely: chemicals,viruses, radiation). The mutated cells transmit theircharacters to the next progeny of cells and result in cancer.\\n5. Genetic regulators of normal and abnormal mitosis.  In\\nnormal cell growth, regulatory genes control mitosis as well\\nas cell aging, terminating in cell death by apoptosis.\\nIn normal cell growth, there are 4 regulatory genes:\\ni) Proto-oncogenes  are growth-promoting genes i.e. they\\nencode for cell proliferation pathway.ii) Anti-oncogenes  are growth-inhibiting or growth suppressor\\ngenes.iii) Apoptosis regulatory genes  control the programmed cell\\ndeath.iv) DNA repair genes  are those normal genes which regulate\\nthe repair of DNA damage that has occurred during mitosisand also control the damage to proto-oncogenes and anti-oncogenes.In cancer, the transformed cells are produced by\\nabnormal cell growth due to genetic damage to these normalcontrolling genes. Thus, corresponding abnormalities in these4 cell regulatory genes are as under:i) Activation of growth-promoting oncogenes  causing\\ntransformation of cell (mutant form of normal proto-oncogene in cancer is termed oncogene ). Many of these cancer\\nassociated genes, oncogenes, were first discovered in viruses,and hence named as v-onc . Gene products of oncogenes are\\ncalled oncoproteins. Oncogenes are considered dominant since\\nthey appear in spite of presence of normal proto-oncogenes.ii) Inactivation of cancer-suppressor genes  (i.e. inactivation of\\nanti-oncogenes) permitting the cellular proliferation oftransformed cells. Anti-oncogenes are active in recessive form\\ni.e. they are active only if both alleles are damaged.iii) Abnormal apoptosis regulatory genes  which may act as\\noncogenes or anti-oncogenes. Accordingly, these genes maybe active in dominant or recessive form.iv) Failure of DNA repair genes  and thus inability to repair the\\nDNA damage resulting in mutations.\\nCancer-related Genes and Cell Growth\\n(Hallmarks of Cancer)\\nIt is apparent from the above discussion that genes control\\nthe normal cellular growth, while in cancer these controllinggenes are altered, typically by mutations. A large number ofsuch cancer-associated genes have been described, each witha specific function in cell growth. Some of these genes arecommonly associated in many tumours (e.g. p53 or TP53 ),\\nwhile others are specific to particular tumours. Therefore, itis considered appropriate to discuss the role of cancer-relatedgenes with regard to their functions in cellular growth.Following are the  major genetic properties or hallmarks of cancer :\\n1.Excessive and autonomous growth: Growth-promoting\\noncogenes.2. Refractoriness to growth inhibition: Growth suppressinganti-oncogenes.3.\\nEscaping cell death by apoptosis: Genes regulating\\napoptosis and cancer.4. Avoiding cellular aging: Telomeres and telomerase incancer.5. Continued perfusion of cancer: Cancer angiogenesis.6. Invasion and distant metastasis: Cancer dissemination.7. DNA damage and repair system: Mutator genes andcancer.8. Cancer progression and tumour heterogeneity: Clonalaggressiveness.9. Cancer a sequential multistep molecular phenomenon:Multistep theory.10. MicroRNAs in cancer: OncomiRs.\\nThese properties of cancer cells are described below in\\nterms of molecular genetics and schematically illustrated in\\nFig. 8.19.\\n1. EXCESSIVE AND AUTONOMOUS GROWTH:\\nGROWTH PROMOTING ONCOGENES\\nMutated form of normal protooncogenes in cancer is called\\noncogenes. Protooncogenes become activated oncogenes byfollowing mechanisms as under:Figure 8.18 The monoclonal origin of tumour cells in uterine\\nleiomyoma.\\n210SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nBy mutation in the protooncogene which alters its\\nstructure and function.\\nBy retroviral insertion in the host cell.\\nBy damage to the DNA sequence that normally regulates\\ngrowth-promoting signals of protooncogenes resulting in its\\nabnormal activation.\\nBy erroneous formation of extra copies of protooncogene\\ncausing gene amplification and hence its overexpression oroverproduction that promotes autonomous and excessivecellular proliferation.\\n In general, overactivity of oncogenes enhances cell\\nproliferation and promotes development of human cancer.About 100 different oncogenes have been described invarious cancers. Transformation of proto-oncogene (i.e.normal cell proliferation gene) to oncogenes (i.e. cancer cellproliferation gene) may occur by three mechanisms:i) Point mutations i.e. an alteration of a single base in the\\nDNA chain.  The most important example is RAS  oncogene\\ncarried in many human tumours such as bladder cancer,pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma.ii) Chromosomal translocations  i.e. transfer of a portion of one\\nchromosome carrying protooncogene to anotherchromosome and making it independent of growth controls.This is implicated in the pathogenesis of leukaemias andlymphomas e.g.\\nPhiladelphia chromosome seen in 95% cases of chronic\\nmyelogenous leukaemia in which c-ABL  protooncogene on\\nchromosome 9 is translocated to chromosome 22.\\nIn 75% cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma, translocation of c-\\nMYC proto-oncogene from its site on chromosome 8 to a\\nportion on chromosome 14.iii) Gene amplification i.e. increasing the number of copies of\\nDNA sequence in protooncogene leading to increased\\nmDNA and thus increased or overexpressed gene product.Examples of gene amplification are found in some solidhuman tumours e.g.\\nNeuroblastoma having n-MYC HSR region.\\nERB-B1  in breast and ovarian cancer.\\nMost of the oncogenes encode for components of cell\\nsignaling system for promoting cell proliferation. Possibleeffects of oncogenes in signal transduction for cell\\nproliferation in human tumours are discussed below in\\nrelation to the role of protooncogenes in mitosis in normalcell cycle and are listed in Table 8.4  and schematically shown\\nin Fig. 8.20:\\ni) Growth factors (GFs).  GFs were the first protoonocgenes\\nto be discovered which encode for cell proliferation cascade.\\nThey act by binding to cell surface receptors to activate cell\\nproliferation cascade within the cell. GFs are smallpolypeptides elaborated by many cells and normally act onanother cell than the one which synthesised it to stimulate\\nits proliferation i.e. paracrine action .\\nHowever, a cancer cell may synthesise a GF and respond\\nto it as well; this way cancer cells acquire growth self-\\nsufficiency. Most often, growth factor genes are not alteredor mutated but instead growth factor genes are overexpressedto stimulate large secretion of GFs which stimulate cell\\nproliferation. The examples of such tumour secreted GFs are\\nas under:a) Platelet-derived growth factor- (PDGF-\\nβ): Overexpression of\\nSIS protooncogene that encodes for PDGF- β and thus thereFigure 8.19 Schematic representation of major properties of cancer in terms of molecular carcinogenesis.\\n211CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia\\nis increased secretion of PDGF- β  e.g. in gliomas and\\nsarcomas.\\nb) Transforming growth factor- α (TGF- α): Overexpression of\\nTGF- α  gene occurs by stimulation of RAS protooncogene\\nand induces cell proliferation by binding to epidermal growthfactor ( EGF)  receptor e.g. in carcinoma and astrocytoma.c) Fibroblast growth factor (FGF ): Overexpression of HST-1\\nprotoonogene and amplification of INT-2 protoonogene\\ncauses excess secretion of FGF e.g. in cancer of the bowel\\nand breast.d) Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF):  Overexpression by binding\\nto its receptor c-MET  e.g. follicular carcinoma thyroid.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.4: Important Oncogenes, their Mechanism of Activation and Associated Human Tumours.\\nType Proto-oncogene Mechanism Associated Human Tumours\\n1.

Growth factors cannot penetrate the\\ncell directly and require to be transported intracellularly by\\nGF-specific cell surface receptors. These receptors aretransmembrane proteins and thus have two surfaces: theouter surface of the membrane has an area for binding growthfactor, and the inner surface of the membrane has enzyme-activating area which eventually activates cell proliferationpathway.\\nMost often, mutated form of growth factor receptors\\nstimulate cell proliferation even without binding to growthfactors i.e. with little or no growth factor bound to them.Various forms of oncogenes encoding for GF receptorsinclude other mechanisms: overexpression, mutation andgene rearrangement. Examples of tumours by mutatedreceptors for growth factors are as under:a) EGF receptors : Normal EGF  receptor gene is  ERB B1, and\\nhence this receptor is termed as  EGFR or HER1  (i.e. human\\nepidermal growth factor receptor  type 1). EGFR  (or HER1 )\\nacts by overexpression of normal GF receptor e.g. in 80% ofsquamous cell carcinoma of lung and 50% cases ofglioblastomas.\\nAnother EGF receptor gene called ERB B2  (or HER2/neu )\\nacts by gene amplification e.g. in breast cancer (25%  cases),carcinoma of lungs, ovary, stomach.b) c-KIT receptor:  The gene coding for receptor for stem cell\\nfactor (or steel factor) is c-KIT , that activates tyrosine kinase\\npathway in cell proliferation. Mutated form of c-KIT by point\\nmutation activates receptor for tyrosine kinase e.g. ingastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST).c) RET receptor:  RET (abbreviation of ‘ rearranged during\\ntransfection’) protooncogene is a receptor for tyrosine kinase\\nnormally expressed in neuroendocrine cells of differenttissues. Mutated form by point mutation is seen in MEN type2A and 2B and in medullary carcinoma thyroid.\\niii)Cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins. The normal\\nsignal transduction proteins in the cytoplasm transduce\\nsignal from the GF receptors present on the cell surface, tothe nucleus of the cell, to activate intracellular growthsignaling pathways.\\nThere are examples of oncogenes having mutated forms\\nof cytoplasmic signaling pathways located in the innersurface of cell membrane in some cancers. These are as under:a) Mutated RAS gene. This is the most common form ofoncogene in human tumours, the abnormality being inducedby point mutation in RAS gene. About a third of all humantumours carry mutated  RAS  gene ( RAS for Rat Sarcoma gene\\nwhere it was first described), seen particularly in carcinomacolon, lung and pancreas. Normally, the inactive form of RAS\\nprotein is GDP (guanosine diphosphate)-bound while theactivated form is bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP).GDP/GTP are homologous to G proteins and take part insignal transduction in a similar way just as G proteins act as‘on-off switch’ for signal transduction. Normally, active RAS\\nprotein is inactivated by GTPase activity, while mutated RAS\\ngene remains unaffected by GTPase, and therefore, continuesto signal the cell proliferation.b) BCR-ABL hybrid gene . ABL  gene is a non-GF receptor\\nprotooncogene having tyrosine kinase activity. ABL  genefrom its normal location on chromosome 9 is translocated tochromosome 22 where it fuses with BCR  (breakpoint cluster\\nregion) gene and forms an ABL-BCR  hybrid gene which is\\nmore potent in signal transduction pathway. ABL-BCR  hybrid\\ngene is seen in chronic myeloid leukaemia and some acuteleukaemias.\\niv) Nuclear transcription factors.  The signal transduction\\npathway that started with GFs ultimately reaches the nucleus\\nwhere it regulates DNA transcription and induces the cell toenter into S phase. Out of various nuclear regulatory trans-cription proteins described, the most important is MYC  gene\\nlocated on long arm of chromosome 8. Normally MYC  protein\\nbinds to the DNA and regulates the cell cycle bytranscriptional activation and its levels fall immediately aftercell enters the cell cycle.\\nMYC  oncogene (originally isolated from myelocyto-\\nmatosis virus and accordingly abbreviated) is seen mostcommonly in human tumours. It is associated withpersistence of or overexpression of MYC  oncoproteins which,\\nin turn, causes autonomous cell proliferation. The examplesof tumours carrying MYC  oncogene are as under:\\na) C-MYC oncogene:  Mutated MYC  gene due to translocation\\nt(8;14)  seen in Burkitt’s lymphoma.\\nb) N-MYC oncogene : Mutated MYC gene due to amplification\\nseen in neuroblastoma, small cell carcinoma lung.c) L-MYC oncogene:  Mutated MYC gene due to amplification\\nseen in small cell carcinoma lung.\\nv) Cell cycle regulatory proteins.  As discussed in Chapter\\n3, normally the cell cycle is under regulatory control of cyclins\\nand cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) A, B, E and D. Cyclinsare so named since they are cyclically synthesised duringdifferent phases of the cell cycle and their degradation is alsocyclic. Cyclins activate as well as work together with CDKs,while many inhibitors of CDKs (CDKIs) are also known.\\nAlthough all steps in the cell cycle are under regulatory\\ncontrols, G1 → S phase is the most important checkpoint for\\nregulation by oncogenes as well as anti-oncogenes (discussedbelow). Mutations in cyclins (in particular cyclin D) andCDKs (in particular CDK4) are most important growthpromoting signals in cancers. The examples of tumourshaving such oncogenes are as under:a) Mutated form of cyclin D protooncogene  by translocation\\nseen in mantle cell lymphoma.b) Mutated form of cyclin E  by overexpression seen in breast\\ncancer.b) Mutated from of CDK4  by gene amplification  seen  in\\nmalignant melanoma, glioblastoma and sarcomas.\\n2. REFRACTORINESS TO GROWTH INHIBITION:\\nGROWTH SUPPRESSING ANTI-ONCOGENES\\nThe mutation of normal growth suppressor anti-oncogenes\\nresults in removal of the brakes for growth; thus theinhibitory effect to cell growth is removed and the abnormalgrowth continues unchecked. In other words, mutated anti-oncogenes behave like growth-promoting oncogenes.\\nAs compared to the signals and signal transduction\\npathways for oncogenes described above, the steps inmechanisms of action by growth suppressors are not so well213CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia\\nunderstood. In general, the point of action by anti-oncogenes\\nis also G1 → S phase transition and probably act either by\\ninducing the dividing cell from the cell cycle to enter into G0(resting) phase, or by acting in a way that the cell lies in thepost-mitotic pool losing its dividing capability. Just as withactivation of protooncogenes to become oncogenes, themechanisms of loss of tumour suppressor actions of genesare due to chromosomal deletions, point mutations and lossof portions of chromosomes.\\nMajor anti-oncogenes implicated in human cancers are\\nas under (Table 8.5):\\ni) RB gene. RB gene is located on long arm (q) of chromosome\\n13. This is the first ever tumour suppressor gene identifiedand thus has been amply studied. RB gene codes for a nuclear\\ntranscription protein pRB. RB gene is termed as master\\n‘break’ in the cell cycle and is virtually present in everyhuman cell. It can exist in both an active and an inactive  form:\\nThe active form  of RB gene, it blocks cell division by\\nbinding to transcription factor, E2F, and thus inhibits the cellfrom transcription of cell cycle-related genes, therebyinhibiting  the cell cycle at G1 → S phase i.e. cell cycle is\\narrested at G1 phase.\\nInactive form  of RB gene occurs when it is\\nhyperphosphorylated by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs)which occurs when growth factors bind to their receptors.This removes pRB function from the cell (i.e. the ‘break’ oncell division is removed) and thus cell proliferation pathwayis stimulated by permitting  the cell to cross G1 → S phase.\\nActivity of CDKs is inhibited by activation of inhibitorysignal, transforming growth factor- (TGF- β), on cell through\\nactivation of inhibitory protein p16.\\nThe mutant form of RB gene (i.e. inactivating mutation\\nof RB gene) is involved in several human tumours, most\\ncommonly in retinoblastoma, the most common intraoculartumour in young children. The tumour occurs in two forms:sporadic and inherited/familial. More than half the cases aresporadic affecting one eye; these cases have acquiredsimultaneous mutation in both the alleles in retinal cells afterbirth. In inherited cases, all somatic cells inherit one mutantRB gene from a carrier parent, while the other allele gets\\nmutated later. The latter genetic explanation given byKnudson forms the basis of two hit hypothesis of inherited\\ncancers . Besides retinoblastoma, children inheriting mutantRB gene have 200 times greater risk of development of other\\ncancers in early adult life, most notably osteosarcoma; othersare cancers of breast, colon and lungs.\\nii) p53 gene ( TP53 ). Located on the short arm (p) of\\nchromosome 17, p53 gene (also termed TP53 because of\\nmolecular weight of 53 kd for the protein) like pRB  is\\ninhibitory to cell cycle. However, p53 is normally present in\\nvery small amounts and accumulates only after DNAdamage.\\nThe two major functions of p53 in the normal cell cycle\\nare as under:a) In blocking mitotic activity: p53  inhibits the cyclins and CDKs\\nand prevents the cell to enter G1 phase transiently. This\\nbreathing time in the cell cycle is utilised by the cell to repair\\nthe DNA damage.b) In promoting apoptosis : p53 acts together with another anti-\\noncogene, RB gene, and identifies the genes that have\\ndamaged DNA which cannot be repaired by inbuilt system.p53 directs such cells to apoptosis by activating apoptosis-\\ninducing BAX  gene, and thus bringing the defective cells to\\nan end by apoptosis. This process operates in the cell cycle\\nat G1 and G2 phases before the cell enters the S or M phase.\\nBecause of these significant roles in cell cycle, p53 is called\\nas ‘protector of the genome’.\\nIn its mutated form, p53 ceases to act as protector or as\\ngrowth suppressor but instead acts like a growth promoter\\nor oncogene. Homozygous loss of p53 gene allows genetically\\ndamaged and unrepaired cells to survive and proliferateresulting in malignant transformation. More than 70% of\\nhuman cancers have homozygous loss of p53 by acquired\\nmutations in somatic cells;  some common examples are\\ncancers of the lung, head and neck, colon and breast. Besides,\\nmutated p53 is also seen in the sequential development stages\\nof cancer from hyperplasia to carcinoma in situ and into\\ninvasive carcinoma.\\nLess commonly, both alleles of p53 gene become defective\\nby another way: one allele of p53 mutated by inheritance in\\ngerm cell lines rendering the individual to another hit of\\nsomatic mutation on the second allele. This defect like in RB\\ngene predisposes the individual to develop cancers ofmultiple organs (breast, bone, brain, sarcomas etc), termedLi-Fraumeni syndrome.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.5: Important Tumour-suppressor Anti-oncogenes and Associated Human Tumours.\\nGene Location Associated Human Tumours\\n1.

The APC  gene is normally inhibitory to mitosis,\\nwhich takes place by a cytoplasmic protein, β-catenin. β-\\ncatenin normally has dual functions: firstly, it binds to\\ncytoplasmic E-cadherin that is involved in intercellularinteractions, and secondly it can activate cell proliferationsignaling pathway. In colon cancer cells, APC  gene is lost\\nand thus β-catenin fails to get degraded, allowing the cancer\\ncells to undergo mitosis without the inhibitory influence ofβ-catenin.\\nPatients born with one mutant APC  gene allele develop\\nlarge number of polyps in the colon early in life, while afterthe age of 20 years these cases start developing loss of secondAPC  gene allele. It is then that almost all these patients\\ninvariably develop malignant transformation of one or morepolyps.\\nv) Other antioncogenes. A few other tumour-suppressor\\ngenes having mutated germline in various tumours are as\\nunder:\\na) BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes:  These are two breast (BR)\\ncancer (CA)  susceptibility genes: BRCA1 located on\\nchromosoe 17q21 and BRCA2 on chromosome 13q12-13.\\nWomen with inherited defect in BRCA1  gene have very high\\nrisk (85%) of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer\\n(40%). Inherited breast cancer constitutes about 5-10% cases,\\nit tends to occur at a relatively younger age and more often\\ntends to be bilateral.\\nb) VHL gene.  von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare\\nautosomal dominant disease characterised by benign and\\nmalignant tumours of multiple tissues. The disease isinherited as a mutation in VHL  tumour suppressor gene\\nlocated on chromosome 3p. This results in activation of genes\\nthat promote angiogenesis, survival and proliferation; VHL\\ngene is found inactivated in 60% cases of renal cell carcinoma.\\nc) Wilms’ tumour (WT) gene:  Both WT1 an WT2  genes are\\nlocated on chromosome 11 and normally prevent neoplastic\\nproliferation of cells in embryonic kidney. Mutant form of\\nWT-1  and 2 are seen in hereditary Wilms’ tumour.\\nd) Neurofibroma (NF) gene:  NF genes normally prevent\\nproliferation of Schwann cells. Two mutant forms are\\ndescribed: NF1 and NF2 seen in neurofibromatosis type 1\\nand type 2 .\\nThe contrasting features of growth-promoting oncogenes\\nand growth-suppressing anti-oncogenes are summarised in\\nTable 8.6.\\n3. ESCAPING CELL DEATH BY APOPTOSIS:\\nGENES REGULATING APOPTOSIS AND CANCER\\nBesides the role of mutant forms of growth-promoting\\noncogenes and growth-suppressing anti-oncogenes, anothermechanism of tumour growth is by escaping cell death byapoptosis. Apoptosis in normal cell is guided by cell death\\nreceptor, CD95, resulting in DNA damage. Besides, there is\\nrole of some other pro-apoptotic factors ( BAD , BAX , BID and\\np53) and apoptosis-inhibitors ( BCL2,  BCL-X ).\\nIn cancer cells, the function of apoptosis is interfered due\\nto mutations in the above genes which regulate apoptosis inthe normal cell. The examples of tumours by this mechanismare as under:\\na) BCL2 gene is seen in normal lymphocytes, but its mutant\\nform with characteristic translocation (t14;18) (q32;q21) was\\nfirst described in B-cell lymphoma and hence the name BCL.\\nIt is also seen in many other human cancers such as that of\\nbreast, thyroid and prostate. Mutation in BCL2 gene removes\\nthe apoptosis-inhibitory control on cancer cells, thus morelive cells undergoing mitosis contributing to tumour growth.\\nBesides, MYC  oncogene and p53 tumour suppressor gene\\nare also connected to apoptosis. While MYC  allows cell\\ngrowth BCL2  inhibits cell death; thus MYC  and BCL2  together\\nallow cell proliferation. Normally, p53 activates proapoptotic\\ngene BAX  but mutated p53 (i.e. absence of p53) reduces\\napoptotic activity and thus allows cell proliferation.\\nb) CD95 receptors are depleted in hepatocellular carcinoma\\nand hence the tumour cells escape apoptosis.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.6: Oncogenes versus Antioncogenes.\\nFeature Oncogene Antioncogene\\n1.

AVOIDING CELLULAR AGING:\\nTELOMERES AND TELOMERASE IN CANCER\\nAs discussed in pathology of aging in Chapter 3, after each\\nmitosis (cell doubling) there is progressive shortening oftelomeres which are the terminal tips of chromosomes.Telomerase is the RNA enzyme that helps in repair of suchdamage to DNA and maintains normal telomere  length insuccessive cell divisions. However, it has been seen that afterrepetitive mitosis for a maximum of 60 to 70 times, telomeresare lost in normal cells and the cells cease to undergo mitosis.Telomerase is active in normal stem cells but not in normalsomatic cells.\\nCancer cells in most malignancies have markedly\\nupregulated telomerase enzyme, and hence telomere lengthis maintained. Thus, cancer cells avoid aging, mitosis doesnot slow down or cease, thereby immortalising the cancercells.\\n5. CONTINUED PERFUSION OF CANCER:\\nTUMOUR ANGIOGENESIS\\nCancers can only survive and thrive if the cancer cells are\\nadequately nourished and perfused, as otherwise they cannotgrow further. Neovascularisation in the cancers not onlysupplies the tumour with oxygen and nutrients, but thenewly formed endothelial cells also elaborate a few growthfactors for progression of primary as well as metastaticcancer. The stimulus for angiogenesis is provided by therelease of various factors:\\ni) Promoters of tumour angiogenesis  include the most\\nimportant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  (released\\nfrom genes in the parenchymal tumour cells) and basic\\nfibroblast growth factor (bFGF) .\\nii) Anti-angiogenesis factors  inhibiting angiogenesis include\\nthrombospondin-1 (also produced by tumour cells themselves),\\nangiostatin, endostatin and vasculostatin. Mutated form of p53\\ngene in both alleles in various cancers results in removal of\\nanti-angiogenic role of thrombospondin-1, thus favouringcontinued angiogenesis.\\n6. INVASION AND DISTANT METASTASIS:\\nCANCER DISSEMINATION\\nOne of the most important characteristic of cancers is\\ninvasiveness and metastasis. The mechanisms involved inthe biology of invasion and metastasis are discussed alreadyalong with spread of tumours.\\n7. DNA DAMAGE AND REPAIR SYSTEM:\\nMUTATOR GENES AND CANCER\\nNormal cells during complex mitosis suffer from minor\\ndamage to the DNA which is detected and repaired beforemitosis is completed so that integrity of the genome ismaintained. Similarly, small mutational damage to thedividing cell by exogenous factors (e.g. by radiation, chemicalcarcinogens etc) is also repaired. p53 gene is held responsible\\nfor detection and repair of DNA damage. However, if thissystem of DNA repair is defective as happens in someinherited mutations (mutator genes), the defect in unrepairedDNA is passed to the next progeny of cells and cancer results.The examples of mutator genes exist in the following\\ninherited disorders associated with increased propensity to\\ncancer:\\ni)\\nHereditary non-polyposis colon cancer  (Lynch syndrome) is\\ncharacterised by hereditary predisposition to develop\\ncolorectal cancer. It is due to defect in genes involved in DNAmismatch repair which results in accumulation of errors inthe form of mutations in many genes.\\nii) Ataxia telangiectasia (AT)  has ATM (M for mutated) gene.\\nThese patients have multiple cancers besides other features\\nsuch as cerebellar degeneration, immunologic derangementsand oculo-cutaneous manifestations.\\niii) Xeroderma pigmentosum  is an inherited disorder in which\\nthere is defect in DNA repair mechanism. Upon exposure to\\nsunlight, the UV radiation damage to DNA cannot berepaired. Thus, such patients are more prone to various formsof skin cancers.\\niv) Bloom syndrome  is an example of damage by ionising\\nradiation which cannot be repaired due to inherited defect\\nand the patients have increased risk to develop cancers,particularly leukaemia.\\nv) Hereditary breast cancer  patients having mutated BRCA1\\nand BRCA2 genes carry inherited defect in DNA repair\\nmechanism. These patients are not only predisposed to\\ndevelop breast cancer but also cancers of various otherorgans.\\n8. CANCER PROGRESSION AND HETEROGENEITY:\\nCLONAL AGGRESSIVENESS\\nAnother feature of note in biology of cancers is that with\\npassage of time cancers become more aggressive; this\\nproperty is termed tumour progression . Clinical parameters\\nof cancer progression are: increasing size of the tumour,\\nhigher histologic grade (as seen by poorer differentiation andgreater anaplasia), areas of tumour necrosis (i.e. tumouroutgrows its blood supply), invasiveness and distantmetastasis.\\nIn terms of molecular biology, this attribute of cancer is\\ndue to the fact that with passage of time cancer cells acquiremore and more heterogeneity . This means that though cancer\\ncells remain monoclonal in origin, they acquire more andmore mutations which, in turn, produce multiple-mutatedsubpopulations of more aggressive clones of cancer cells (i.e.\\nheterogeneous cells) in the growth which have tendency to\\ninvade, metastasise and be refractory to hormonal influences.Some of these mutations in fact may kill the tumour cells aswell.\\n9. CANCER A SEQUENTIAL MULTISTEP MOLE-\\nCULAR PHENOMENON:  MULTISTEP THEORY\\nIt needs to be appreciated that cancer occurs following several\\nsequential steps of abnormalities in the target cell e.g.initiation, promotion and progression in proper sequence.Similarly, multiple steps are involved at genetic level bywhich cell proliferation of cancer cells is activated: byactivation of growth promoters, loss of growth suppressors,\\ninactivation of intrinsic apoptotic mechanisms and escaping\\ncellular aging. A classic example of this sequential genetic\\nabnormalities in cancer is seen in adenoma-carcinoma216SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nsequence in development of colorectal carcinoma. Recent\\nstudies on human genome in cancers of breast and colon haverevealed that there is a multistep phenomenon ofcarcinogenesis at molecular level; on an average a malignanttumour has large number of genetic mutations in cancers.\\n10. MICRORNAs  IN CANCER: ONCOMIRS\\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionally conserved,\\nendogenous, noncoding single stranded RNA molecules witha length of 22 nucleotides only. Normally, miRNAs functionas the posttranslational gene regulators of cell proliferation,differentiation and survival. More than 500 miRNAs havebeen identified. Recent evidence indicates that miRNAs havean oncogenic role in initiation and progression of cancer andare termed as oncogenic microRNAs, abbreviated asoncomiRs. In combination with other tumour associatedgenes, oncomiRs can perform various functions: as tumoursuppressor, as tumour promoter, and as pro-apoptotic.\\nThe above properties of cancer cells are schematically\\nillustrated in Fig. 8.21.\\nB.CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS\\nThe first ever evidence of any cause for neoplasia came fromthe observation of Sir Percival Pott in 1775 that there washigher incidence of cancer of the scrotum in chimney-sweepsin London than in the general population. This invoked wideinterest in soot and coal tar as possible carcinogenic agentand the possibility of other occupational cancers. The firstsuccessful experimental induction of cancer was producedby two Japanese workers (Yamagiwa and Ichikawa) in 1914in the rabbit’s skin by repeatedly painting with coal tar. Sincethen the list of chemical carcinogens which can experi-mentally induce cancer in animals and have epidemiologicalevidence in causing human neoplasia, is ever increasing.\\nStages in Chemical Carcinogenesis\\nThe induction of cancer by chemical carcinogens occurs after\\na delay—weeks to months in the case of experimentalanimals, and often several years in man. Other factors thatinfluence the induction of cancer are the dose and mode ofadministration of carcinogenic chemical, individualsusceptibility and various predisposing factors.\\nBasic mechanism of  chemical carcinogenesis  is by\\ninduction of mutation in the proto-oncogenes and anti-oncogenes. The phenomena of cellular transformation bychemical carcinogens (as also other carcinogens) is a progres-sive process involving 3 sequential stages: initiation,promotion and progression (Fig. 8.22).\\n1.INITIATION OF CARCINOGENESIS\\nInitiation is the first stage in carcinogenesis induced byinitiator chemical carcinogens. The change can be producedby a single dose of the initiating agent for a short time, thoughlarger dose for longer duration is more effective. The changeso induced is sudden, irreversible and permanent. Chemicalcarcinogens acting as initiators of carcinogenesis can begrouped into 2 categories (Table 8.7):\\nFigure 8.21 Schematic representation of activation-inactivation of cancer-associated genes in cell cycle.\\n217CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia\\nI. Direct-acting carcinogens.  These are a few chemical\\nsubstances (e.g. alkylating agents, acylating agents) which\\ncan induce cellular transformation without undergoing anyprior metabolic activation.\\nII. Indirect-acting carcinogens or procarcinogens.  These require\\nmetabolic conversion within the body so as to become\\n‘ultimate’ carcinogens having carcinogenicity e.g. polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, azo dyes,naturally-occurring products and others.\\nIn either case, the following steps are involved in\\ntransforming ‘the target cell’ into ‘the initiated cell’:\\na) Metabolic activation.  Vast majority of chemical carcino-\\ngens are indirect-acting or procarcinogens requiring\\nmetabolic activation, while direct-acting carcinogens do notrequire this activation. The indirect-acting carcinogens areactivated in the liver by the mono-oxygenases of thecytochrome P-450 system in the endoplasmic reticulum. Insome circumstances, the procarcinogen may be detoxifiedand rendered inactive metabolically.\\nIn fact, following 2 requirements determine the\\ncarcinogenic potency of a chemical:i) Balance between activation and inactivation reaction ofthe carcinogenic chemical.ii) Genes that code for cytochrome P450-dependent enzymesinvolved in metabolic activation e.g a genotype carryingsusceptibility gene CYP1A1 for the enzyme system has far\\nhigher incidence of lung cancer in light smokers as comparedto those not having this permissive gene.Besides these two, additional factors such as age, sex and\\nnutritional status of the host also play some role indetermining response of the individual to chemicalcarcinogen.\\nb) Reactive electrophiles.  While direct-acting carcinogens\\nare intrinsically electrophilic, indirect-acting substances\\nbecome electron-deficient after metabolic activation i.e. theybecome reactive electrophiles. Following this step, both typesof chemical carcinogens behave alike and their reactiveelectrophiles bind to electron-rich portions of other moleculesof the cell such as DNA, RNA and other proteins.\\nc) Target molecules.  The primary target of electrophiles is\\nDNA, producing mutagenesis. The change in DNA may lead\\nto ‘the initiated cell’ or some form of cellular enzymes maybe able to repair the damage in DNA. The classic example ofsuch a situation occurs in xeroderma pigmentosum, aprecancerous condition, in which there is hereditary defectin DNA repair mechanism of the cell and thus such patientsare prone to develop skin cancer. The carcinogenic potentialof a chemical can be tested in vitro by Ames’ test for\\nmutagenesis (described later).\\nAny gene may be the target molecule in the DNA for the\\nchemical carcinogen. However, on the basis of chemicallyinduced cancers in experimental animals and epidemiologicstudies in human beings, it has been observed that mostfrequently affected growth promoter oncogene is RAS gene\\nmutation and anti-oncogene (tumour suppressor) is p53 gene\\nmutation.Figure 8.22 Sequential stages in chemical carcinogenesis ( left) in evolution of cancer ( right).\\n218SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesd) The initiated cell.  The unrepaired damage produced in\\nthe DNA of the cell becomes permanent and fixed only if the\\naltered cell undergoes at least one cycle of proliferation. Thisresults in transferring the change to the next progeny of cellsso that the DNA damage becomes permanent  and irreversible,\\nwhich are the characteristics of the initiated cell, vulnerableto the action of promoters of carcinogenesis.\\nThe stimulus for proliferation may come from\\nregeneration of surviving cells, dietary factors, hormone-induced hyperplasia, viruses etc. A few examples are theoccurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in cases of viralhepatitis, association of endometrial hyperplasia withendometrial carcinoma, effect of oestrogen in breast cancer.\\n2. PROMOTION OF CARCINOGENESIS\\nPromotion is the next sequential stage in the chemical carcino-\\ngenesis. Promoters of carcinogenesis are substances such asphorbol esters, phenols, hormones, artificial sweeteners anddrugs like phenobarbital. They differ from initiators in thefollowing respects:i)They do not produce sudden change.\\nii\\n) They require application or administration, as the case\\nmay be, following  initiator exposure, for sufficient time and\\nin sufficient dose.iii) The change induced may be reversible.iv) They do not damage the DNA per se  and are thus not\\nmutagenic but instead enhance the effect of direct-actingcarcinogens or procarcinogens.v) Tumour promoters act by further clonal proliferation andexpansion of initiated (mutated) cells, and have reducedrequirement of growth factor, especially after RAS gene\\nmutation.\\nIt may be mentioned here that persistent and sustained\\napplication/exposure of the cell to initiator aloneunassociated with subsequent application of promoter mayalso result in cancer. But the vice versa  does not hold true\\nsince neither application of promoter alone, nor itsapplication prior to exposure to initiator carcinogen, wouldresult in transformation of target cell.\\n3. PROGRESSION OF CARCINOGENESIS\\nProgression of cancer is the stage when mutated proliferated\\ncell shows phenotypic features of malignancy. These featurespertain to morphology, biochemical composition andmolecular features of malignancy. Such phenotypic featuresappear only when the initiated cell starts to proliferate rapidlyand in the process acquires more and more mutations.  Thenew progeny of cells that develops after such repetitiveproliferation inherits genetic and biochemical characteristicsof malignancy.\\nCarcinogenic Chemicals in Humans\\nThe list of diverse chemical compounds which can produce\\ncancer in experimental animals is a long one but only someof them have sufficient epidemiological evidence in humanneoplasia.\\nDepending upon the mode of action of carcinogenic\\nchemicals, they are divided into 2 broad groups: initiatorsand promoters (Table 8.7).1.INITIATOR CARCINOGENS\\nChemical carcinogens which can initiate the process ofneoplastic transformation are further categorised into 2\\nsubgroups—direct-acting and indirect-acting carcinogens orprocarcinogens.\\nI. DIRECT-ACTING CARCINOGENS.  These chemical\\ncarcinogens do not require metabolic activation and fall into\\n2 classes:\\na)Alkylating agents.  This group includes mainly various\\nanti-cancer drugs (e.g. cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil,\\nbusulfan, melphalan, nitrosourea etc), β-propiolactone and\\nepoxides. They are weakly carcinogenic and are implicatedin the etiology of the lymphomas and leukaemias in human\\nbeings.\\nb\\n) Acylating agents.  The examples are acetyl imidazole and\\ndimethyl carbamyl chloride.\\nII. INDIRECT-ACTING CARCINOGENS (PRO-\\nCARCINOGENS).  These are chemical substances which\\nrequire prior metabolic activation before becoming potent‘ultimate’ carcinogens. This group includes vast majority ofcarcinogenic chemicals. It includes the following 4 categories:\\na) Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  They comprise the\\nlargest group of common procarcinogens which, after\\nmetabolic activation, can induce neoplasia in many tissuesin experimental animals and are also implicated in a numberof human neoplasms. They cause different effects by variousmodes of administration e.g. by topical application mayinduce skin cancer, by subcutaneous injection may causesarcomas, inhalation produces lung cancer, when introducedin different organs by parenteral/metabolising routes maycause cancer of that organ.\\nMain sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are:\\ncombustion and chewing of tobacco, smoke, fossil fuel (e.g.coal), soot, tar, mineral oil, smoked animal foods, industrialand atmospheric pollutants. Important chemical compoundsincluded in this group are: anthracenes (benza-, dibenza-,dimethyl benza-), benzapyrene and methylcholanthrene. Thefollowing examples have evidence to support the etiologicrole of these substances:\\nSmoking and lung cancer:  There is 20 times higher incidence\\nof lung cancer in smokers of 2 packs (40 cigarettes) per dayfor 20 years.\\nSkin cancer:  Direct contact of polycyclic aromatic hydro-\\ncarbon compounds with skin is associated with higherincidence of skin cancer. For example, the natives of Kashmircarry an earthen pot containing embers, the kangri,  under\\ntheir clothes close to abdomen to keep themselves warm, andskin cancer of the abdominal wall termed kangri cancer  is\\ncommon among them.\\nTobacco and betel nut chewing and cancer oral cavity:  Cancer\\nof the oral cavity is more common in people chewing tobaccoand betel nuts. The chutta  is a cigar that is smoked in South\\nIndia (in Andhra Pradesh) with the lighted end in the mouth(i.e. reversed smoking) and such individuals have higherincidence of cancer of the mouth.\\nb) Aromatic amines and azo-dyes.  This category includes\\nthe following substances implicated in chemical\\ncarcinogenesis:219CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia\\nβ-naphthylamine in the causation of bladder cancer, espe-\\ncially in aniline dye and rubber industry workers.\\nBenzidine in the induction of bladder cancer.\\nAzo-dyes used for colouring foods (e.g. butter and\\nmargarine to give them yellow colour, scarlet red for\\ncolouring cherries etc) in the causation of hepatocellularcarcinoma.\\nc) Naturally-occurring products.  Some of the important\\nchemical carcinogens derived from plant and microbial sour-\\nces are aflatoxin B1, actinomycin D, mitomycin C, safrole andbetel nuts. Out of these, aflatoxin B1 implicated in causinghuman hepatocellular carcinoma is the most important,especially when concomitant viral hepatitis B is present. It isderived from the fungus, Aspergillus flavus,   that grows in\\nstored grains and plants.\\nd) Miscellaneous.  A variety of other chemical carcinogens\\nhaving a role in the etiology of human cancer are as under:\\nNitrosamines and nitrosamides  are involved in gastric\\ncarcinoma. These compounds are actually made in the\\nstomach by nitrosylation of food preservatives.Vinyl chloride monomer derived from PVC (polyvinyl\\nchloride) polymer in the causation of haemangiosarcoma of\\nthe liver.\\nAsbestos in bronchogenic carcinoma and mesothelioma,\\nespecially in smokers.\\nArsenical compounds in causing epidermal hyperplasia and\\nbasal cell carcinoma.\\nMetals like nickel, lead, cobalt, chromium etc in industrial\\nworkers causing lung cancer.\\nInsecticides and fungicides (e.g. aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane)\\nin carcinogenesis in experimental animals.\\nSaccharin and cyclomates in cancer in experimental animals.\\n2. PROMOTER CARCINOGENS\\nPromoters are chemical substances which lack the intrinsic\\ncarcinogenic potential but their application subsequent to\\ninitiator exposure helps the initiated cell to proliferate further.These substances include phorbol esters, phenols,  certainhormones and drugs.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.7: Important Chemical Carcinogens.\\nCarcinogen Tumour\\nI.

PHYSICAL CARCINOGENESIS\\nPhysical agents in carcinogenesis are divided into 2 groups:\\n1.Radiation,  both ultraviolet light and ionising radiation, is\\nthe most important physical agent. The role of radiation as\\ncarcinogenic agent is discussed below while its non-neoplastic complications are described in Chapter 3.\\n2.Non-radiation  physical agents are the various forms of\\ninjury and are less important.\\n1. Radiation Carcinogenesis\\nUltraviolet (UV) light and ionising radiation are the two\\nmain forms of radiation carcinogens which can inducecancer in experimental animals and are implicated incausation of some forms of human cancers. A propertycommon between the two forms of radiation carcinogens isthe appearance of mutations followed by a long period oflatency after initial exposure, often 10-20 years or even later.Also, radiation carcinogens may act to enhance the effectof another carcinogen (co-carcinogens) and, like chemicalcarcinogens, may have sequential stages of initiation,promotion and progression in their evolution. Ultravioletlight and ionising radiation differ in their mode of actionas described below:\\ni) ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT.  The main source of UV\\nradiation is the sunlight; others are UV lamps and welder’s\\narcs. UV light penetrates the skin for a few millimetres onlyso that its effect is limited to epidermis. The efficiency of UVlight as carcinogen depends upon the extent of light-i) Phorbol esters . The best known promoter in experimental\\nanimals is TPA  (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate) which acts\\nby signal induction protein activation pathway.ii\\n) Hormones . Endogenous or exogenous oestrogen excess in\\npromotion of cancers of endometrium and breast, prolongedadministration of diethylstilbestrol in the etiology ofpostmenopausal endometrial carcinoma and in vaginalcancer in adolescent girls born to mothers exposed to thishormone during their pregnancy.iii) Miscellaneous  e.g. dietary fat in cancer of  colon, cigarette\\nsmoke and viral infections etc.\\nThe feature of initiators and promoters are contrasted in\\nTable 8.8.\\nTests for Chemical Carcinogenicity\\nThere are 2 main methods of testing chemical compound for\\nits carcinogenicity:\\n1.\\nEXPERIMENTAL INDUCTION.  The traditional method\\nis to administer the chemical compound under test to a batch\\nof experimental animals like mice or other rodents by anappropriate route e.g. painting on the skin, giving orally orparenterally, or by inhalation. The chemical is administeredrepeatedly, the dose varied, and promoting agents areadministered subsequently. After many months, the animalis autopsied and results obtained. However, all positive ornegative tests cannot be applied to humans since there issufficient species variation in susceptibility to particularcarcinogen. Besides, the test is rather prolonged andexpensive.\\n2. TESTS FOR MUTAGENICITY (AMES’ TEST).  A muta-\\ngen is a substance that can permanently alter the genetic\\ncomposition of a cell. Ames’ test evaluates the ability of achemical to induce mutation in the mutant strain of Salmonella\\ntyphimurium  that cannot synthesise histidine. Such strains\\nare incubated with the potential carcinogen to which liverhomogenate is added to supply enzymes required to convertprocarcinogen to ultimate carcinogen. If the chemical undertest is mutagenic, it will induce mutation in the mutant strainsof S. typhimurium  in the form of functional histidine gene,\\nwhich will be reflected by the number of bacterial coloniesgrowing on histidine-free culture medium (Fig. 8.23).  Most\\nof the carcinogenic chemicals tested positive in Ames’ test\\nare carcinogenic in vivo.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.8: Contrasting Features of Initiator and Promoter Carcinogens.\\nFeature Initiator Carcinogens Promoter Carcinogens\\n1.

Examples Most chemical carcinogens, radiation Hormones, phorbol esters\\nFigure 8.23 Schematic representation of the Ames’ test.\\n221CHAPTER 8 Neoplasiaabsorbing protective melanin pigmentation of the skin. In\\nhumans, excessive exposure to UV rays can cause variousforms of skin cancers—squamous cell carcinoma, basal cellcarcinoma and malignant melanoma. In support of this isthe epidemiological evidence of high incidence of these skincancers in fair-skinned Europeans, albinos who do not tanreadily, in inhabitants of Australia and New Zealand livingclose to the equator who receive more sunlight, and infarmers and outdoor workers due to the effect of actinic lightradiation.\\nMechanism.  UV radiation may have various effects on the\\ncells. The most important is induction of mutation; others\\nare inhibition of cell division, inactivation of enzymes andsometimes causing cell death. The most importantbiochemical effect of UV radiation is the formation ofpyrimidine dimers in DNA. Such UV-induced DNA damagein normal individuals is repaired, while in the predisposedpersons who are excessively exposed to sunlight suchdamage remain unrepaired. The proof in favour of mutageniceffect of UV radiation comes from following recessivehereditary diseases characterised by a defect in DNA repairmechanism and associated with high incidence of cancers:a) Xeroderma pigmentosum is predisposed to skin cancersat younger age (under 20 years of age).b) Ataxia telangiectasia is predisposed to leukaemia.c) Bloom’s syndrome is predisposed to all types of cancers.d) Fanconi’s anaemia with increased risk to develop cancer.\\nBesides, like with other carcinogens, UV radiation also\\ninduces mutated forms of oncogenes (in particular RAS gene)\\nand anti-oncogenes ( p53 gene).\\nii) IONISING RADIATION.  Ionising radiation of all kinds\\nlike X-rays, α-, β- and γ-rays, radioactive isotopes, protons\\nand neutrons can cause cancer in animals and in man. Mostfrequently, radiation-induced cancers are all forms ofleukaemias (except chronic lymphocytic leukaemia); othersare cancers of the thyroid (most commonly papillarycarcinoma), skin, breast, ovary, uterus, lung, myeloma, andsalivary glands (Fig. 8.24).  The risk is increased by higher\\ndose and with high LET (linear energy transfer) such as inneutrons and α-rays than with low LET as in X-rays and γ-\\nrays. The evidence in support of carcinogenic role of ionisingradiation is cited in the following examples:a)Higher incidence of radiation dermatitis and subsequent\\nmalignant tumours of the skin was noted in X-ray workersand radiotherapists who did initial pioneering work in thesefields before the advent of safety measures.b) High incidence of osteosarcoma was observed in young\\nAmerican watch-working girls engaged in painting the dialswith luminous radium who unknowingly ingested radiumwhile using lips to point their brushes.c)\\nMiners in radioactive elements have higher incidence of\\ncancers.d) Japanese atom bomb survivors of the twin cities ofHiroshima and Nagasaki after World War II have increasedfrequency of malignant tumours, notably acute and chronicmyeloid leukaemias, and various solid tumours of breast,colon, thyroid and lung.e) Accidental leakage at nuclear power plant in 1985 inChernobyl (in former USSR, now in Ukraine) has causedlong-term hazardous effects of radioactive material to thepopulation living in the vicinity.f) It has been observed that therapeutic X-ray irradiationresults in increased frequency of cancers, e.g. in patients ofankylosing spondylitis, in children with enlarged thymus,and in children irradiated in utero during investigations on\\nthe mother.\\nMechanism.   Radiation damages the DNA of the cell by one\\nof the 2 possible mechanisms:\\na) It may directly alter the cellular DNA.b) It may dislodge ions from water and other molecules of\\nthe cell and result in formation of highly reactive free radicalsthat may bring about the damage.\\nDamage to the DNA resulting in mutagenesis is the most\\nimportant action of ionising radiation. It may causechromosomal breakage, translocation, or point mutation. Theeffect depends upon a number of factors such as type ofradiation, dose, dose-rate, frequency and various host factorssuch as age, individual susceptibility, immune competence,hormonal influences and type of cells irradiated.\\n2. Non-radiation Physical Carcinogenesis\\nMechanical injury to the tissues such as from stones in the\\ngallbladder, stones in the urinary tract, and healed scarsfollowing burns or trauma, has been suggested as the causeof increased risk of carcinoma in these tissues but theevidence is not convincing. Asbestosis and asbestos-associated tumours of the lung are discussed in Chapter 17,Figure 8.24 Neoplastic (left) and non-neoplastic complications (right)\\nof ionising radiation.\\n222SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesthe characteristic tumour being malignant mesothelioma of\\nthe pleura. Other examples of physical agents incarcinogenesis are the implants of inert materials such asplastic, glass etc in prostheses or otherwise, and foreignbodies observed to cause tumour development inexperimental animals. However, tumorigenesis by thesematerials in humans is rare.\\nD. BIOLOGIC CARCINOGENESIS\\nThe epidemiological studies on different types of cancers\\nindicate the involvement of transmissible biologic agents intheir development, chiefly viruses.  Other biologic agents\\nimplicated in carcinogenesis are as follows:\\nParasites. Schistosoma haematobium  infection of the urinary\\nbladder is associated with high incidence of squamous cellcarcinoma of the urinary bladder in some parts of the worldsuch as in Egypt. Clonorchis sinensis, the liver fluke, lives in\\nthe hepatic duct and is implicated in causation ofcholangiocarcinoma.\\nFungus. Aspergillus flavus  grows in stored grains and\\nliberates aflatoxin; its human consumption, especially bythose with HBV infection, is associated with development ofhepatocellular carcinoma.\\nBacteria.  Helicobacter pylori, a gram-positive spiral-shaped\\nmicro-organism, colonises the gastric mucosa and has beenfound in cases of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer; itsprolonged infection may lead to gastric lymphoma andgastric carcinoma, this subject is discussed in detail inChapter 20.\\nHowever, the role of viruses in the causation of cancer is\\nmore significant. Therefore, biologic carcinogenesis is largelyviral carcinogenesis,  described below.\\nVIRAL CARCINOGENESIS\\nIt has been estimated that about 20% of all cancers worldwide\\nare due to persistent virus infection. The association ofoncogenic viruses with neoplasia was first observed by anItalian physician Sanarelli in 1889 who noted associationbetween myxomatosis of rabbits with poxvirus. Thecontagious nature of the common human wart was firstestablished in 1907. Since then, a number of viruses capableof inducing tumours (oncogenic viruses) in experimentalanimals, and some implicated in humans, have beenidentified.\\nOncogenic Viral Infections: General Aspects\\nMost of  the common viral infections (including oncogenic\\nviruses) can be transmitted by one of the 3 routes:\\ni)Horizontal transmission.  Commonly, viral infection passes\\nfrom one to another by direct contact, by ingestion ofcontaminated water or food, or by inhalation as occurs inmost contagious diseases. Most of these infections begin onthe epithelial surfaces, spread into deeper tissues, and thenthrough haematogenous or lymphatic or neural routedisseminate to other sites in the body.ii)By parenteral route such by inoculation as happens in some\\nviruses by inter-human spread and from animals and insectsto humans.iii)Vertical transmission,  when the infection is genetically\\ntransmitted from infected parents to offsprings.\\nBased on their nucleic acid content, oncogenic viruses fall\\ninto 2 broad groups:\\n1.\\nThose containing deoxyribonucleic acid are called DNA\\noncogenic viruses.\\n2. Those containing ribonucleic acid are termed RNA\\noncogenic viruse or retroviruses.\\nBoth types of oncogenic viruses usually have 3 genes and\\nare abbreviated according to the coding pattern by each gene:\\ni) gag gene: codes for group antigen.\\nii) pol gene: codes for polymerase enzyme.\\niii) env gene: codes fro envelope protein.\\nPrimary viral infections  are majority of the common viral\\ninfections in which the infection lasts for a few days to a fewweeks and produce clinical manifestations. Primary viralinfections are generally cleared by body’s innate immunityand specific immune responses. Subsequently, an\\nimmunocompetent host is generally immune to the disease\\nor reinfection by the same virus.  However, body’s immunesystem is not effective against surface colonization or deepinfection or persistence of viral infection.\\nPersistence of viral infection or latent infection  in some\\nviruses may occur by acquiring mutations in viruses which\\nresist immune attack by the host, or virus per se  induces\\nimmunosuppression in the host such as HIV.\\nViral Oncogenesis: General Aspects\\nIn general, persistence of DNA or RNA viruses may induce\\nmutation in the target host cell, although persistence of viralinfection alone is not sufficient for oncogenesis but is one\\nstep in the multistep process of cancer development.\\nGenerally, RNA viruses have very high mutation rate (e.g.HIV, HCV) than DNA viruses. Mechanisms as to how specificDNA and RNA viruses cause mutation in the host cell arevaried, but in general persistence of DNA or RNA viralinfection causes activation of growth-promoting pathways\\nor inhibition of tumour-suppressor products in the infected\\ncells. Thus, such virus-infected host cells after havingundergone genetic changes enter cell cycle and produce nextprogeny of transformed cells which have characteristics ofautonomous growth and survival completing their role asoncogenic viruses.\\nGeneral mode of oncogenesis by each group of DNA and\\nRNA oncogenic viruses is briefly considered below:\\n1. Mode of DNA viral oncogenesis.  Host cells infected by\\nDNA oncogenic viruses may have one of the following 2\\nresults (Fig. 8.25):\\ni)\\nReplication. The virus may replicate in the host cell with\\nconsequent lysis of the infected cell and release of virions.\\nii)\\nIntegration.  The viral DNA may integrate into the host\\ncell DNA.\\nThe latter event (integration) results in inducing mutation\\nand thus neoplastic transformation of the host cell, while the\\nformer (replication) brings about cell death but no neoplastic\\ntransformation. A feature essential for host cell trans-\\nformation is the expression of virus-specific T-(transformingprotein) antigens immediately after infection of the host cell\\nby DNA oncogenic virus (discussed later).223CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia\\n2. Mode of RNA viral oncogenesis.  RNA viruses or\\nretroviruses contain two identical strands of RNA and the\\nenzyme, reverse transcriptase (Fig. 8.26):\\ni) Reverse transcriptase is RNA-dependent DNA synthetasethat acts as a template to synthesise a single strand of matching\\nviral  DNA i.e. reverse of the normal in which DNA is\\ntranscribed into messenger RNA.ii) The single strand of viral DNA is then copied by DNA-\\ndependent DNA synthetase to form another strand ofcomplementary DNA resulting in double-stranded viral  DNA\\nor provirus.iii) The provirus is then integrated into the DNA of the hostcell genome and may induce mutation and thus transformthe cell into neoplastic cell.\\niv)Retroviruses are replication-competent . The host cells which\\nallow replication of integrated retrovirus are calledpermissive cells. Non-permissible cells do not permitreplication of the integrated retrovirus.v\\n) Viral replication begins after integration of the provirus\\ninto host cell genome. Integration results in transcription ofproviral genes or progenes into messenger RNA which thenforms components of the virus particle —virion core protein from\\ngag gene, reverse transcriptase from pol gene, and envelope\\nglycoprotein from env gene. The three components of virus\\nparticle are then assembled at the plasma membrane of thehost cell and the virus particles released by budding off fromthe plasma membrane, thus completing the process ofreplication.\\nSupport to the etiologic role of oncogenic viruses in\\ncausation of human cancers is based on the following:1. Epidemiologic data.2. Presence of viral DNA in the genome of host target cell.3. Demonstration of virally induced transformation ofhuman target cells in culture.4.In vivo  demonstration of expressed specific transforming\\nviral genes in premalignant and malignant cells.Figure 8.25 Replication and integration of DNA virus in the host\\ncell.\\nA, Replication:  Step 1.  The DNA virus invades the host cell. Step 2.  Viral\\nDNA is incorporated into the host nucleus and T-antigen is expressedimmediately after infection. Step 3.  Replication of viral DNA occurs and\\nother components of virion are formed. The new virions are assembledin the cell nucleus. Step 4.  The new virions are released, accompanied\\nby host cell lysis. B, Integration : Steps 1 and 2  are similar as in replication.\\nStep 3. Integration of viral genome into the host cell genome occurswhich requires essential presence of functional T-antigen. Step 4.  A\\n‘transformed (neoplastic) cell’ is formed.Figure 8.26\\nIntegration and replication of RNA virus (retrovirus) in\\nthe host cell.Step 1. The RNA virus invades the host cell. The viral envelope fuseswith the plasma membrane of the host cell; viral RNA genome as well asreverse transcriptase are released into the cytosol. Step 2.  Reverse\\ntranscriptase acts as template to synthesise single strand of matchingviral DNA which is then copied to form complementary DNA resulting indouble-stranded viral DNA (provirus). Step 3.  The provirus is integrated\\ninto the host cell genome producing ‘transformed host cell.’ Step 4 .\\nIntegration of the provirus brings about replication of viral componentswhich are then assembled and released by budding.\\n224SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques5.In vitro  assay of specific viral gene products which\\nproduce effects on cell proliferation and survival.\\nWith these general comments, now we turn to specific\\nDNA and RNA oncogenic viruses and oncogenesis by them.\\nSpecific DNA Oncogenic Viruses\\nDNA oncogenic viruses have direct access to the host cell\\nnucleus and are incorporated into the genome of the hostcell. DNA viruses are classified into 5 subgroups, each ofwhich is capable of producing neoplasms in different hosts(Table 8.9). These are: Papovaviruses, Herpesviruses,\\nAdenoviruses, Poxviruses and Hepadna viruses.\\n1. PAPOVAVIRUSES.  This group consists of the papilloma\\nvirus including the human papilloma virus (HPV), polyoma\\nvirus and SV-40 (simian vacuolating) virus. These viruseshave an etiologic role in following benign and malignantneoplasms in animals and in humans:\\ni)Papilloma viruses.  These viruses were the first to be\\nimplicated in the etiology of any human neoplasia. These\\nviruses appear to replicate in the layers of stratified squamousepithelium. More than 100 HPV types have been identified;the individual types are associated with different lesions. Thefollowing examples of benign and malignant tumours arecited to demonstrate their role in oncogenesis:\\nIn humans —\\nHPV was first detected as etiologic agent in common skin\\nwarts  or verruca vulgaris (squamous cell papillomas) by\\nShope in 1933; the condition is infectious. Current evidencesupports implication of low-risk HPV types 1,2, 4 and 7 in\\ncommon viral warts.\\nLow-risk HPV types 6 and 11 are involved in the etiology\\nof genital warts ( condyloma acuminata).\\nViral DNA of high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45\\nhas been seen in 75-100% cases of invasive cervical cancer and\\nits precursor lesions (carcinoma in situ and dysplasia) and is\\nstrongly implicated .\\nHigh-risk HPVs are also involved in causation of other\\nsquamous cell carcinomas  and dysplasias such as of anus,\\nperianal region, vagina, vulva, penis and oral cavity.\\nHPV types 5 and 8  are responsible for causing an\\nuncommon condition, epidermodysplasia  verruciformis.  The\\ncondition is characterised by multiple skin warts and agenetic defect in the cell-mediated immunity. About one-third of cases develop squamous cell carcinoma in the sun-exposed warts.\\nSome strains of HPV are responsible for causing multiple\\njuvenile papillomas  of the larynx.\\nIn animals—\\nBenign warty lesions similar to those seen in humans are\\nproduced by different members of the papilloma virus familyin susceptible animals such as in rabbits by cottontail rabbitpapilloma virus, and in cattle by bovine papilloma virus(BPV).\\nThere is evidence to suggest the association of BPV and\\ncancer of the alimentary tract in cattle.\\nHPV ONCOGENESIS  IN HUMAN CANCER—\\nPersistent infection with high-risk HPV types in target\\nepithelial cells drives the molecular hallmarks of cancer\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.9: DNA Oncogenic Viruses.\\nVirus Host Associated Tumour\\n1.

E6 and E7 from high-risk HPVs has high affinity\\nfor target host cells than these viral oncoproteins from low-\\nrisk HPVs.\\nii) E6 and E7 viral proteins cause loss of p53 and pRB, the\\ntwo cell proteins with tumour-suppressor properties. Thus\\nthe breaks in cell proliferation are removed, permitting theuncontrolled proliferation.\\niii) These viral proteins activate cyclin A and E, and inactivate\\nCDKIs, thus permitting further cell proliferation.\\niv) These viral proteins mediate and degrade BAX , a\\nproapoptotic gene, thus inhibiting apoptosis.v)  These viral proteins activate telomerase, immortalising\\nthe transformed host target cells.\\nii) Polyoma virus.  Polyoma virus occurs as a natural\\ninfection in mice.\\nIn animals —Polyoma virus infection is responsible for\\nvarious kinds of carcinomas and sarcomas in\\nimmunodeficient (nude) mice and other rodents. In view ofits involvement in causation of several unrelated tumours inanimals, it was named polyoma.\\nIn humans —Polyoma virus infection is not known to\\nproduce any human tumour. But it is involved in causationof polyomavirus nephropathy in renal allograft recipientsand is also implicated in the etiology of progressivedemyelinating leucoencephalopathy, a fatal demyelinatingdisease.\\niii)SV-40 virus.  As the name suggests, simian vacuolating\\nvirus exists in monkeys without causing any harm but can\\ninduce sarcoma in hamsters. There is some evidence ofinvolvement of SV-40 infection in mesothelioma of the pleura.\\n2. HERPESVIRUSES.  Primary infection of all the\\nherpesviruses in man persists probably for life in a latent\\nstage which can get reactivated later. Important members ofherpesvirus family are Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplexvirus type 2 (HSV-2) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8),cytomegalovirus (CMV), Lucke’s frog virus and Marek’s\\ndisease virus. Out of these, Lucke’s frog virus and Marek’s\\ndisease virus are implicated in animal tumours only (renalcell carcinoma and T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma respectively).There is no oncogenic role of HSV-2 and CMV in humantumours. The other two—EBV and HHV are implicated inhuman tumours as under.\\nEPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS (EBV).  EBV infects human B-\\nlymphocytes and epithelial cells and long-term infection\\nstimulates them to proliferate and development of\\nmalignancies. EBV is implicated in the following humantumours—Burkitt’s lymphoma, anaplastic nasopharyngealcarcinoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease,primary CNS lymp homa in AIDS patients, and Hodgkin’s\\nlymphoma. It is also shown to be causative for infectious\\nmononucleosis, a self-limiting disease in humans. The roleof EBV in the first two human tumours is given below while\\nothers have been discussed elsewhere in relevant chapters.\\nBurkitt’s lymphoma.  Burkitt’s lymphoma was initially\\nnoticed in African children by Burkitt in 1958 but is now\\nknown to occur in 2 forms— African endemic form,  and sporadic\\nform  seen elsewhere in the world. The morphological aspects\\nof the tumour are explained in Chapter 14, while oncogenesisis described here.\\nThere is strong evidence linking Burkitt’s lymphoma, a\\nB-lymphocyte neoplasm, with EBV as observed from the\\nfollowing features:\\na\\n) Over 90% of Burkitt’s lymphomas are EBV-positive in\\nwhich the tumour cells carry the viral DNA.b) 100% cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma show elevated levels\\nof antibody titers to various EBV antigens.\\nc) EBV has strong tropism for B lymphocytes. EBV-infectedB cells grown in cultures are immortalised i.e. they continueto develop further along B cell-line to propagate their progeny\\nin the altered form.\\nd) Though EBV infection is almost worldwide in all adultsand is also known to cause self-limiting infectiousmononucleosis, but the fraction of EBV-infected circulating\\nB cells in such individuals is extremely small.\\ne) Linkage between Burkitt’s lymphoma and EBV infectionis very high in African endemic form of the disease andprobably in cases of AIDS than in sporadic form of the\\ndisease.\\nHowever, a few observations, especially regarding spora-\\ndic cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma, suggest that certain other\\nsupportive factors may be contributing. Immunosuppression\\nappears to be one such most significant factor. The evidencein favour is as follows:\\nNormal individuals harbouring EBV-infection as well as\\ncases developing infectious mononucleosis are able to mountgood immune response so that they do not develop Burkitt’slymphoma.\\nIn immunosuppressed patients such as in HIV infection\\nand organ transplant recipients, there is marked reductionin body’s T-cell immune response and higher incidence ofthis neoplasm.\\nIt is observed that malaria, which confers immuno-\\nsuppressive effect on the host, is prevalent in endemicproportions in regions where endemic form of Burkitt’slymphoma is frequent. This supports the linkage of EBV\\ninfection and immunosuppression in the etiology of Burkitt’s\\nlymphoma.\\nAnaplastic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  This is the other\\ntumour having close association with EBV infection. The\\ntumour is prevalent in South-East Asia, especially in the\\nChinese, and in Eskimos. The morphology of nasopharyngealcarcinoma is described in Chapter 18. The evidence linkingEBV infection with this tumour is as follows:\\na) 100% cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma carry DNA of\\nEBV in nuclei of tumour cells.\\nb) Individuals with this tumour have high titers ofantibodies to various EBV antigens.226SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesHowever, like in case of Burkitt’s lymphoma, there may\\nbe some co-factors  such as genetic susceptibility that account\\nfor the unusual geographic distribution.\\nEBV ONCOGENESIS IN HUMAN CANCER—\\nPersistent EBV infection is implicated in the causation ofmalignancies of B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Themechanism of oncogenesis is as under:i) Latently infected epithelial cells or B lymphocytes expressviral oncogene LMP1 (latent membrane protein)  which is\\nmost crucial step in evolution of EBV-associated malig-nancies. Immunosuppressed individuals are unable to mountattack against EBV infection and thus are more affected.ii) LMP1  viral protein dysregulates normal cell proliferation\\nand survival of infected cells and acts like CD40 receptormolecule on B cell surface. Thus, it stimulates B-cellproliferation by activating growth signaling pathways vianuclear factor κB (NF- κB) and JAK/STAT pathway.\\niii) LMP1  viral oncoprotein also activates BCL2  and thereby\\nprevents apoptosis.iv) Persistent EBV infection elaborates another viral proteinEBNA-2  which activates cyclin D in the host cells and thus\\npromotes cell proliferation.v) In immunocompetent individuals, LMP1  is kept under\\ncontro by the body’s immune system and in these personstherefore lymphoma cells appear only after anothercharacteristic mutation t(8;14) activates growth promotingMYC  oncogene.\\nHUMAN HERPESVIRUS 8 (HHV-8).  It has been shown that\\ninfection with HHV-8 or Kaposi’s sarcoma-associatedherpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma, avascular neoplasm common in patients of AIDS. Comparedto sporadic Kaposi’s sarcoma, the AIDS-associated tumouris multicentric and more aggressive. HHV-8 has lympho-tropism and is also implicated in causation of pleural effusionlymphoma and multicentric variant of Castleman’s disease.\\nHHV-8 (KSHV) ONCOGENESIS IN HUMAN CANCER—\\ni) Viral DNA is seen in nuclei of all tumour cells in Kaposi’ssarcoma.ii) There is overexpression of several KSHV oncoproteins bylatently infected cells: v-cyclin, v-interferon regulatory factor(v-IRF) and LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen).iii) These viral proteins cause increased proliferation andsurvival of host cells and thus induce malignancy.\\n3. ADENOVIRUSES.  The human adenoviruses cause\\nupper respiratory infections and pharyngitis.\\nIn humans,  they are not known to be involved in any\\ntumour.\\nIn hamsters,  they may induce sarcomas.\\n4. POXVIRUSES.  This group of oncogenic viruses is\\ninvolved in the etiology of following lesions:\\nIn rabbits —poxviruses cause myxomatosis.\\nIn humans —poxviruses cause molluscum contagiosum\\nand may induce squamous cell papilloma.\\n5. HEPADNAVIRUSES.  Hepatitis B virus (HBV)  is a\\nmember of hepadnavirus ( hepa-  from hepatitis, -dna from\\nDNA) family. HBV infection in man causes an acute hepatitisand is responsible for a carrier state, which can result in some\\ncases to chronic hepatitis progressing to hepatic cirrhosis,and onto hepatocellular carcinoma. These lesions and the\\nstructure of HBV are described in detail in Chapter 21. Suffice\\nthis to say here that there is strong epidemiological evidencelinking HBV infection to development of hepatocellularcarcinoma as evidenced by the following:a)The geographic differences in the incidence of\\nhepatocellular carcinoma closely match the variation in\\nprevalence of HBV infection e.g. high incidence in Far-East\\nand Africa.b\\n) Epidemiological studies in high incidence regions\\nindicate about 200 times higher risk of developing hepato-cellular carcinoma in HBV-infected cases as compared touninfected population in the same area.\\nPosssible mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma\\noccurring in those harbouring long-standing infection withHBV is chronic destruction of HBV-infected hepatocytesfollowed by continued hepatocyte proliferation. This processrenders the hepatocytes vulnerable to the action of other riskfactors such as to aflatoxin causing mutation and neoplastic\\nproliferation.\\nMore recent evidence has linked an oncogenic role to\\nanother hepatotropic virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well\\nwhich is an RNA virus, while HBV is a DNA virus. HCV isimplicated in about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinomain much the same way as HBV.\\nHEPATITIS VIRUS ONCOGENESIS IN HUMAN CANCER—\\nEpidemiologic data firmly support that two hepatotropic\\nviruses, HBV—a DNA virus, and HCV—an RNA virus, are\\ncurrently involved in causation of 70-80% cases ofhepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Although HBV DNAhas been found integrated in the genome of humanhepatocytes in many cases of liver cancer which causesmutational changes but a definite pattern is lacking. Thus,\\nexact molecular mechanism as to how HBV and HCV cause\\nhepatocellular carcinoma is yet not quite clear. Probably,multiple factors are involved:i) Chronic and persistent viral infection with HBV or HCVincites repetitive cycles of inflammation, immune response,cell degeneration/cell death, and regeneration of the\\nhepatocytes which leads to DNA damage to liver cells of the\\nhost.ii) It is possible that immune response by the host topersistent unresolved infection with these hepatitis virusesbecomes defective which promotes tumour development.iii) On regeneration, proliferation of hepatocytes is stimulated\\nby several growth factors and cytokines elaborated by\\nactivated immune cells which contribute to tumourdevelopment e.g. factors for angiogenesis, cell survival etc.iv) Activated immune cells produce nuclear factor κB\\n(NF- κB) that inhibits apoptosis, thus allowing cell survival\\nand growth.\\nv) HBV genome contains a gene HBx which activates growth\\nsignaling pathway.vi) HBV and HCV do not encode for any specific viral\\noncoproteins.227CHAPTER 8 NeoplasiaSpecific RNA Oncogenic Viruses\\nRNA oncogenic viruses are retroviruses i.e. they contain the\\nenzyme reverse transcriptase (RT), though all retrovirusesare not oncogenic (Table 8.10). The enzyme, reverse trans-\\ncriptase, is required for reverse transcription of viral RNAto synthesise viral DNA strands i.e. reverse of normal—ratherthan DNA encoding for RNA synthesis, viral RNA transcriptsfor the DNA by the enzyme RT present in the RNA viruses.RT is a DNA polymerase and helps to form complementaryDNA (cDNA) that moves in to host cell nucleus and getsincorporated in to it.\\n Based on their activity to transform target cells into\\nneoplastic cells, RNA viruses are divided into 3 subgroups—acute transforming viruses, slow transforming viruses, andhuman T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV). The former twoare implicated in inducing a variety of tumours in animalsonly while HTLV is causative for human T-cell leukaemiaand lymphoma.\\n1. ACUTE TRANSFORMING VIRUSES.  This group\\nincludes retroviruses which transform all the cells infected\\nby them into malignant cells rapidly (‘acute’). All the virusesin this group possess one or more viral oncogenes ( v-oncs ).\\nAll the members of acute transforming viruses discoveredso far are defective viruses in which the particular v-onc has\\nsubstituted other essential genetic material such as gag, pol\\nand env.  These defective viruses cannot replicate by\\nthemselves unless the host cell is infected by another ‘helpervirus’. Acute oncogenic viruses have been identified intumours in different animals only e.g.\\na) Rous sarcoma virus in chickens.\\nb\\n) Leukaemia-sarcoma viruses of various types such as\\navian, feline, bovine and primate.\\n2. SLOW TRANSFORMING VIRUSES.  These oncogenic\\nretroviruses cause development of leukaemias and\\nlymphomas in different species of animals (e.g. in mice, catsand bovine) and include the mouse mammary tumour virus(MMTV) that causes breast cancer in the daughter-micesuckled by the MMTV-infected mother via the causal agentin the mother’s milk ( Bittner milk factor ). These viruses have\\nlong incubation period between infection and developmentof neoplastic transformation (‘slow’). Slow transformingviruses cause neoplastic transformation by insertional\\nmutagenesis  i.e. viral DNA synthesised by viral RNA via\\nreverse transcriptase is inserted  or integrated near the\\nprotooncogenes of the host cell resulting in damage to hostcell genome ( mutagenesis ) leading to neoplastic trans-\\nformation.\\n3. HUMAN T-CELL LYMPHOTROPIC VIRUSES\\n(HTLV). HTLV is a form of slow transforming virus but is\\ndescribed separately because of 2 reasons:i)This is the only retrovirus implicated in human cancer.\\nii\\n) The mechanism of neoplastic transformation is different\\nfrom slow transforming as well as from acute transformingviruses.\\nFour types of HTLVs are recognised—HTLV-I, HTLV-II,\\nHTLV-III and HTLV-IV. It may be mentioned in passing herethat the etiologic agent for AIDS, HIV, is also an HTLV(HTLV-III) as described in Chapter 4.\\nA link between HTLV-I infection and cutaneous adult T-\\ncell leukaemia-lymphoma (ATLL) has been identified whileHTLV-II is implicated in causation of T-cell variant of hairycell leukaemia. HTLV-I is transmitted through sexual contact,by blood, or to infants during breastfeeding. The highlightsof this association and mode of neoplastic transformationare as under:i) Epidemiological studies by tests for antibodies haveshown that HTLV-I infection is endemic in parts of Japanand West Indies where the incidence of ATLL is high. Thelatent period after HTLV-I infection is, however, very long(20-30 years).ii) The initiation of neoplastic process is similar to that forBurkitt’s lymphoma except that HTLV-I has tropism forCD4+T lymphocytes as in HIV infection, while EBV ofBurkitt’s lymphoma has tropism for B lymphocytes.iii)  As in Burkitt’s lymphoma, immunosuppression plays asupportive role in the neoplastic transformation by HTLV-Iinfection.\\nHTLV ONCOGENESIS IN HUMAN CANCER—\\nThe molecular mechanism of ATLL leukaemogenesis byHTLV infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes is not clear.Neoplastic transformation by HTLV-I infection differs from\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.10: RNA Oncogenic Viruses.\\nVirus Host Associated Tumour\\n1.

TAX  protein up-regulates the\\nexpression of cellular genes\\n controlling T-cell replication,\\nwhile REX  gene product regulates viral protein production\\nby affecting mRNA expression.ii) TAX viral protein interacts with transcription factor, NF-\\nκB, which stimulates genes for cytokines (interleukins) and\\ntheir receptors in infected T cells which activates proliferationof T cells by autocrine pathway.iii) The inappropriate gene expression activates pathway ofthe cell proliferation by activation of cyclins and inactivationof tumour suppressor genes CDKN2A/p16 and p53,stimulating cell cycle.iv) Initially, proliferation of infected T cells is polyclonal butsubsequently several mutations appear due to TAX-basedgenomic changes in the host cell and monoclonal proliferationof leukaemia occurs.\\nVIRUSES AND HUMAN CANCER: A SUMMARY\\nIn man, epidemiological as well as circumstantial evidence\\nhas been accumulating since the discovery of contagiousnature of common human wart (papilloma) in 1907 thatcancer may have viral etiology. Presently, about 20% of allhuman cancers worldwide are virally induced. Aside fromexperimental evidence, the etiologic role of DNA and RNAviruses in a variety of human neoplasms has already beenexplained above. Here, a summary of different virusesimplicated in human tumours is presented (Fig. 8.27):\\nBenign tumours.  There are 2 conditions which are actually\\ndoubtful as tumours in which definite viral etiology is esta-blished. These are:i)Human wart (papilloma) caused by human papilloma\\nvirus; andii)\\nMolluscum contagiosum caused by poxvirus.\\nMalignant tumours.  The following 8 human cancers have\\nenough epidemiological, serological, and in some casesgenomic evidence, that viruses are implicated in theiretiology:i)Burkitt’s lymphoma  by Epstein-Barr virus.\\nii)Nasopharyngeal carcinoma  by Epstein-Barr virus.\\niii)Primary hepatocellular  carcinoma by hepatitis B virus and\\nhepatitis C virus.iv)Cervical cancer  by high risk human papilloma virus types\\n(HPV 16 and 18).v)Kaposi’s sarcoma  by human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8).\\nvi)Pleural effusion B cell lymphoma by HHV8.\\nvii) Adult T-cell leukaemia and lymphoma  by HTLV-I.\\nviii) T-cell variant of hairy cell leukaemia  by HTLV-II.\\nCurrent knowledge and understanding of viral\\ncarcinogenesis has provided an opportunity to invent specificvaccines and suggest appropriate specific therapy. Forexample, hepatitis B vaccines is being widely used to controlhepatitis B and is expected to lower incidence of HBV-relatedhepatocellular carcinoma. HPV vaccine has been launched\\nlately and is likely to lower the incidence of HPV-associated\\ncervical cancer.\\nCLINICAL ASPECTS OF NEOPLASIA\\nTwo major aspects of clinical significance in assessing thecourse and management of neoplasia are: tumour-host inter-relationship (i.e. the effect of tumour on host and vice versa )\\nand laboratory diagnosis of cancer.\\nTUMOUR-HOST INTER-RELATIONSHIP\\nThe natural history of a neoplasm depends upon 2 features:\\ni) Host response against tumour (Immunology of cancer)\\nii)\\nEffect of tumour on host\\nHOST RESPONSE AGAINST TUMOUR(TUMOUR IMMUNOLOGY)\\nIt has long been known that body’s immune system can\\nrecognise tumour cells as ‘non-self’ and attempt to destroythem and limit the spread of cancer. The followingobservations provide basis for this concept:1.Certain cancers evoke significant lymphocytic infiltrates\\ncomposed of immunocompetent cells and such tumours havesomewhat better prognosis e.g. medullary carcinoma breast(as compared with infiltrating ductal carcinoma), seminomatestis (as compared with other germ cell tumours of testis).2. Rarely, a cancer may spontaneously regress partially or\\ncompletely, probably under the influence of host defensemechanism. For example, rare spontaneous disappearanceFigure 8.27 Viruses (in brackets) in human tumours.\\n229CHAPTER 8 Neoplasiaof malignant melanoma temporarily from the primary site\\nwhich may then reappear as metastasis.3. It is highly unusual to have primary and secondarytumours in the spleen due to its ability to destroy the growthand proliferation of tumour cells.4. Immune surveillance exists is substantiated by increasedfrequency of cancers in immunodeficient host e.g. in AIDSpatients, or development of post-transplant lymphoprolife-rative disease.\\nIn an attempt to substantiate the above observations and\\nto understand the underlying host defense mechanisms,experimental animal studies involving tumour transplantswere carried out. The findings of animal experiments coupledwith research on human cancers has led to the concept ofimmunology of cancer discussed under the followingheadings:1. Tumour antigens2. Antitumour immune responses3 Immunotherapy.\\n1. TUMOUR ANTIGENS.  Tumour cells express surface\\nantigens which have been seen in animals and in some\\nhuman tumours. Older classification of tumour antigens wasbased on their surface sharing characteristics on normalversus tumour cells and on their recognition by cytotoxic Tlymphocytes CTL (CD8+T cells) on the basis of class I MHCmolecules. Accordingly, tumour antigens were categorisedinto following two types:i)Tumour-specific antigens (TSAs)  located on tumour cells\\nand are unique or specific antigens for particular tumour andnot shared by normal cells.i\\ni) Tumour associated antigens (TAAs)  are present on tumour\\ncells as well as on some normal cells from where the tumouroriginated.\\nHowever, it is now known that TSAs and TAAs can both\\nbe present on normal cells and categorisation into TSA andTAA does not hold true. Thus, presently distinction oftumour antigens is based on their recognition by the hostimmune cells, i.e. CD8+ T cells (CTL), and by the molecularstructure of the tumour antigens. Currently, various groupsof tumour antigens are as follows:1. Oncoproteins from mutated oncogenes : Protein products\\nderived from mutated oncogenes result in expression of cellsurface antigens on tumour cells. The examples includeproducts of RAS, BCL/ABL  and CDK4.\\n2. Protein products of tumour suppressor genes . In some tumours,\\nprotein products of mutated tumour suppressor genes causeexpression of tumour antigens on the cell surface. Theexamples are mutated proteins p53 and β-catenin.\\n3. Overexpressed cellular proteins.  Some tumours are associated\\nwith a normal cellular protein but is excessively expressedin tumour cells and incite host immune response. Forexample, in melanoma the tumour antigen is structurallynormal melanocyte specific protein, tyrosinase, which isoverexpressed compared with normal cells. Similarly, HER2/neu protein is overexpressed in many cases of breast cancer.\\n4. Abnormally expressed cellular proteins.  Sometimes, a cellular\\nprotein is present in some normal cells but is abnormallyexpressed on the surface of tumour cells of some cancers.The classic example is presence of MAGE  gene silent innormal adult tissues except in male germ line but MAGE\\ngenes are expressed on surface of many tumours such asmelanoma (abbreviation MAGE  from ‘melanoma antigen’ in\\nwhich it was first found), cancers of liver, lung, stomach andoesophagus. Other examples of similar aberrantly expressedgene products in cancers are GAGE (G antigen), BAGE  (B\\nmelanoma antigen) and RAGE (renal tumour antigen).\\n5. Tumour antigens from viral oncoproteins.  As already\\ndiscussed above, many oncogenic viruses express viraloncoproteins which result in expression of antigens ontumour cells e.g. viral oncoproteins of HPV (E6, E7) in cervicalcancer and EBNA proteins of EBV in Burkitt’s lymphoma.6. Tumour antigens from randomly mutated genes.  Various other\\ncarcinogens such as chemicals and radiation induce randommutations in the target cells. These mutated cells elaborateprotein products targeted by the CTL of the immune systemcausing expression of tumour antigens.7. Cell specific differentiation antigens . Normally differentiated\\ncells have cellular antigens which forms the basis ofdiagnostic immunohistochemistry. Cancers have varyingdegree of loss of differentiation but particular lineage of thetumour cells can be identified by tumour antigens. Forexample, various CD markers for various subtypes oflymphomas, prostate specific antigen (PSA) in carcinoma ofprostate.8. Oncofoetal antigens . Oncofoetal antigens such as α-\\nfoetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) arenormally expressed in embryonic life. But these antigensappear in certain cancers—AFP in liver cancer and CEA incolon cancer which can be detected in serum as cancermarkers.9. Abnormal cell surface molecules.  The normal cell expresses\\nsurface molecules of glycolipids, glycoproteins, mucins andblood group antigens. In some cancers, there is abnormallychanged expression of these molecules. For example, theremay be changed blood group antigen, or abnormalexpression of mucin in ovarian cancer (CA-125) and in breastcancer (MUC-1).\\n2. ANTI-TUMOUR IMMUNE RESPONSES.  Although the\\nhost immune response to tumour is by both cell-mediated\\nand humoral immunity, the major anti-tumour effectormechanism is cell-mediated.\\ni)Cell-mediated mechanism.  This is the main mechanism\\nof destruction of tumour cells by the host. The following\\ncellular responses can destroy the tumour cells and inducetumour immunity in humans:a)Specifically sensitised cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)  i.e.\\nCD8+ T cells are directly cytotoxic to the target cell andrequire contact between them and tumour cells. CTL havebeen found to be effective against virally-induced cancerse.g. in Burkitt’s lymphoma (EBV-induced), invasivesquamous cell carcinoma of cervix (HPV-induced).b)Natural killer (NK)  cells are lymphocytes which after\\nactivation by IL-2, destroy tumour cells without sensitisation,either directly or by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity(ADCC). NK cells together with T lymphocytes are the firstline of defense against tumour cells and can lyse tumour cells.c)  Macrophages  are activated by interferon- γ secreted by\\nT-cells and NK-cells, and therefore there is close collaboration230SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesof these two subpopulation of lymphocytes and\\nmacrophages. Activated macrophages  mediate cytotoxicity\\nby production of oxygen free radicals or by tumour necrosisfactor.\\nii) Humoral mechanism.  As such there are no anti-tumour\\nhumoral antibodies which are effective against cancer cells\\nin vivo. However, in vitro  humoral antibodies may kill\\ntumour cells by complement activation or by antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. Based on this, monoclonal antibodytreatment is offered to cases of some non-Hodgkin’slymphoma.\\niii) Immune regulatory mechanism.  In spite of host immune\\nresponses, most cancers grow relentlessly. This is due to some\\nof the following controlling mechanisms:a) During progression of the cancer, immunogenic cells maydisappear.b) Cytotoxic T-cells and NK-cells may play a self regulatoryrole.c) Immunosuppression mediated by various acquiredcarcinogenic agents (viruses, chemicals, radiation).d) Immunosuppressive role of factors secreted by tumourcells e.g. transforming growth factor- β.\\nThe mechanisms of these immune responses are\\nschematically illustrated in Fig. 8.28.\\n3. IMMUNOTHERAPY.  Despite the existence of anti-\\ntumour immune responses, the cancers still progress andeventually cause death of the host. The immune responsesto be effective enough must eliminate the cancer cells morerapidly than their rate of proliferation and hence the role ofboosting the immune response or immunotherapy.\\ni) Non-specific stimulation  of the host immune response\\nwas initially attempted with BCG,  Corynebacterium parvum\\nand levamisole, but except slight effect in acute lymphoid\\nleukaemia, it failed to have any significant influence in anyother tumour.ii\\n) Specific stimulation  of the immune system was attemp-\\nted next by immunising the host with irradiated tumour cellsbut failed to yield desired results because if the patient’stumour within the body failed to stimulate effectiveimmunity, the implanted cells of the same tumour areunlikely to do so.\\niii)Current status of immunotherapy  is focussed on\\nfollowing three main approaches:\\na)Cellular immunotherapy  consists of infusion of tumour-\\nspecific cytotoxic T cells which will increase the populationof tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The patient’speripheral blood lymphocytes are cultured with interleukin-2 which generates lymphokine-activated killer cells havingpotent anti-tumour effect.b)Cytokine therapy  is used to build up specific and non-\\nspecific host defenses. These include: interleukin-2,interferon- α and - γ, tumour necrosis factor- α, and\\ngranulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).c)Monoclonal antibody therapy  is currently being tried against\\nCD20 molecule of B cells in certain B cell leukaemias andlymphomas.\\nEFFECT OF TUMOUR ON HOST\\nMalignant tumours produce more ill-effects than the benign\\ntumours. The effects may be local, or generalised and morewidespread.\\n1. LOCAL EFFECTS . Both benign and malignant tumours\\ncause local effects on the host due to their size or location.\\nMalignant tumours due to rapid and invasive growthpotential have more serious effects. Some of the local effectsof tumours are as under:\\ni) Compression.  Many benign tumours pose only a\\ncosmetic problem. Some benign tumours, however, due to\\ntheir critical location, have more serious consequences e.g.pituitary adenoma may lead to serious endocrinopathy; asmall benign tumour in ampulla of Vater may lead to biliaryobstruction.\\nii\\n) Mechanical obstruction.  Benign and malignant tumours\\nin the gut may produce intestinal obstruction.\\niii)Tissue destruction.  Malignant tumours, both primary\\nand metastatic, infiltrate and destroy the vital structures.\\niv) Infarction, ulceration, haemorrhage.  Cancers have a\\ngreater tendency to undergo infarction, surface ulceration\\nand haemorrhage than the benign tumours. Secondarybacterial infection may supervene. Large tumours in mobileorgans (e.g. an ovarian tumour) may undergo torsion andproduce infarction and haemorrhage.\\n2. CANCER CACHEXIA.  Patients with advanced and\\ndisseminated cancers terminally have asthenia (emaciation),\\nand anorexia, together referred to as cancer cachexia(meaning wasting). Exact mechanism of cachexia is not clearbut it does not occur due to increased nutritional demandsof the tumour. Possibly, cachectin or tumour necrosis factorα (TNF- α) and interleukin-1 derived from macrophages play\\na contributory role in cachexia. Various other causes includenecrosis, ulceration, haemorrhage, infection, malabsorption,anxiety, pain, insomnia, hypermetabolism and pyrexia.\\nFigure 8.28 Schematic illustration of immune responses in cancer.\\nFor details see the text (CTL = cytotoxic T-lymphocyte; NK cell = natural\\nkiller cell; ADCC = antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity).\\n231CHAPTER 8 Neoplasia3. FEVER.  Fever of unexplained origin may be presenting\\nfeature in some malignancies such as in Hodgkin’s disease,\\nadenocarcinoma kidney, osteogenic sarcoma and many othertumours. The exact mechanism of tumour associated feveris not known but probably the tumour cells themselveselaborate pyrogens.\\n4. TUMOUR LYSIS SYNDROME.  This is a condition\\ncaused by extensive destruction of a large number of rapidly\\nproliferating tumour cells. The condition is seen more oftenin cases of lymphomas and leukaemias than solid tumoursand may be due to large tumour burden (e.g. in Burkitt’slymphoma), chemotherapy, administration of glucocorti-coids or certain hormonal agents (e.g. tamoxifen). It ischaracterised by hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia,hyperphosphataemia and hypocalcaemia, all of which mayresult in acidosis and renal failure.\\n5. PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES.  Paraneoplastic\\nsyndromes (PNS) are a group of conditions developing in\\npatients with advanced cancer which are neither explainedby direct and distant spread of the tumour, nor by the usualhormone elaboration by the tissue of origin of the tumour.About 10 to 15% of the patients with advanced cancer developone or more of the syndromes included in the PNS. Rarely,PNS may be the earliest manifestation of a latent cancer.\\nThe various clinical syndromes included in the PNS are\\nas summarised in Table 8.11  and are briefly outlined below:\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.11: Summary of Paraneoplastic Syndromes.\\nClinical Syndrome Underlying Cancer Mechanism\\n1.

Elaboration of hormones or\\nhormone-like substances by cancer cells of non-endocrine\\norigin is called as ectopic hormone production. Someexamples are given below:\\na)Hypercalcaemia.  Symptomatic hypercalcaemia unrelated\\nto hyperparathyroidism is the most common syndrome in\\nPNS. It occurs from elaboration of parathormone-likesubstance by tumours such as squamous cell carcinoma ofthe lung, carcinoma kidney, breast and adult T cell leukaemialymphoma.\\nb)Cushing’s syndrome.  About 10% patients of small cell\\ncarcinoma of the lung elaborate ACTH or ACTH-like\\nsubstance producing Cushing’s syndrome. In addition, caseswith pancreatic carcinoma and neurogenic tumours may beassociated with Cushing’s syndrome.\\nc)Polycythaemia.  Secretion of erythropoietin by certain\\ntumours such as renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular\\ncarcinoma and cerebellar haemangioma may causepolycythaemia.\\nd)Hypoglycaemia.  Elaboration of insulin-like substance by\\nfibrosarcomas, islet cell tumours of pancreas and\\nmesothelioma may cause hypoglycaemia.\\nii) Neuromyopathic syndromes.  About 5% of cancers are\\nassociated with progressive destruction of neurons\\nthroughout the nervous system without evidence ofmetastasis in the brain and spinal cord. This is probably medi-ated by immunologic mechanisms. The changes in theneurons may affect the muscles as well. The changes are:peripheral neuropathy, cortical cerebellar degeneration,myasthenia gravis syndrome, polymyositis.\\niii)Effects on osseous, joints and soft tissue.  e.g. hyper-\\ntrophic osteoarthropathy and clubbing of fingers in cases of\\nbronchogenic carcinoma by unknown mechanism.\\niv) Haematologic and vascular syndrome.  e.g. venous\\nthrombosis (Trousseau’s phenomenon), non-bacterial\\nthrombotic endocarditis, disseminated intravascular coagu-lation (DIC), leukemoid reaction and normocytic normo-chromic anaemia occurring in advanced cancers. Auto-immune haemolytic anaemia may be associated with B-cellmalignancies.\\nv) Gastrointestinal syndromes.  Malabsorption of various\\ndietary components as well as hypoalbuminaemia may be\\nassociated with a variety of cancers which do not directlyinvolve small bowel.\\nvi) Renal syndromes.  Renal vein thrombosis or systemic\\namyloidosis may produce nephrotic syndrome in patients\\nwith cancer.\\nvii) Cutaneous syndromes.  Acanthosis nigricans charac-\\nterised by the appearance of black warty lesions in the axillae\\nand the groins may appear in the course of adenocarcinomaof gastrointestinal tract. Other cutaneous lesions in PNSinclude seborrheric dermatitis in advanced malignanttumours and exfoliative dermatitis in lymphomas andHodgkin’s disease.\\nviii) Amyloidosis.  Primary amyloid deposits may occur\\nin multiple myeloma whereas renal cell carcinoma and othersolid tumours may be associated with secondary systemic\\namyloidosis.\\nPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER\\nWhen the diagnosis of cancer is suspected on clinical\\nexamination and on other investigations, it must beconfirmed. The most certain and reliable method which hasstood the test of time is the histological examination of biopsy,though recently many other methods to arrive at the correctdiagnosis or confirm the histological diagnosis are availablewhich are discussed in Chapter 2.\\n1. Histological Methods\\nThese methods are based on microscopic examination of\\nproperly fixed tissue (excised tumour mass or open/needlebiopsy from the mass), supported with complete clinical andinvestigative data. These methods are most valuable inarriving at the accurate diagnosis. The tissue must be fixedin 10% formalin for light microscopic examination and inglutaraldehyde for electron microscopic studies, while quick-frozen section and hormonal analysis are carried out on fresh\\nunfixed tissues.\\nThe histological diagnosis by either of these methods is\\nmade on the basis that morphological features of  benign\\ntumours  resemble those of normal tissue and that they are\\nunable to invade and metastasise, while malignant tumours\\nare identified by lack of differentiation in cancer cells termed‘anaplasia’ or ‘cellular atypia’ and may invade as well asmetastasise. The light microscopic and ultrastructuralcharacteristics of neoplastic cell have been described in earlierpart of this chapter.\\n2.\\nCytological Methods\\nThese are discussed in detail in Chapter 11.\\nCytological methods for diagnosis consist of study of cells\\nshed off into body cavities (exfoliative cytology) and study\\nof cells by putting a fine needle introduced under vacuuminto the lesion (fine needle aspiration cytology, FNAC).\\ni) Exfoliative cytology.  Cytologic smear (Papanicolaou or\\nPap smear) method was initially employed for detecting\\ndysplasia, carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma of the\\nuterine cervix. However, its use has now been widelyextended to include examination of sputum and bronchialwashings; pleural, peritoneal and pericardial effusions; urine,gastric secretions, and CSF. The method is based onmicroscopic identification of the characteristics of malignantcells which are incohesive and loose and are thus shed off or‘exfoliated’ into the lumen. However, a ‘negative diagnosis’does not altogether rule out malignancy due to possibility ofsampling error.\\nii) Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).  Currently,\\ncytopathology includes not only study of exfoliated cells but\\nalso materials obtained from superficial and deep-seatedlesions in the body which do not shed off cells freely. Thelatter method consists of study of cells obtained by a fineneedle introduced under vacuum into the lesion, so called233CHAPTER 8 Neoplasiafine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).  The superficial masses\\ncan be aspirated under direct vision while deep-seated\\nmasses such as intra-abdominal, pelvic organs andretroperitoneum are frequently investigated by ultrasound(US) or computed tomography (CT)-guided fine needleaspirations. The smears are fixed in 95% ethanol by wetfixation, or may be air-dried unfixed. While Papanicolaoumethod of staining is routinely employed in most laboratoriesfor wet fixed smears,  others prefer H and E due to similarity\\nin staining characteristics in the sections obtained by paraffin-embedding. Air-dried smears  are stained by May-Grunwald-\\nGiemsa or Leishman stain. FNAC has a diagnostic reliabilitybetween 80-97% but it must not be substituted for clinicaljudgement or compete with an indicated histopathologicbiopsy.\\n3. Histochemistry and Cytochemistry\\nHistochemistry and cytochemistry are additional diagnostic\\ntools which help the pathologist in identifying the chemicalcomposition of cells, their constituents and their productsby special staining methods.\\nThough immunohistochemical techniques are more\\nuseful for tumour diagnosis (see below), histochemical andcytochemical methods are still employed for this purpose.\\nSome of the common examples are summarised in\\nTable 8.12,  while the subject is discussed at length in\\nChapter 2.\\n4. Immunohistochemistry\\nThis is an immunological method of recognising a cell by\\none or more of its specific components in the cell membrane,cytoplasm or nucleus. These cell components (calledantigens) combine with specific antibodies on the formalin-\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.12: Common Histochemical/Cytochemical Stains\\nin Tumour Diagnosis.\\nSubstance Stain\\n1.

The complex\\nof antigen-antibody on slide is made visible for lightmicroscopic identification by either fluorescent dyes (‘fluoro-chromes’) or by enzyme system (‘chromogens’). The specificantibody against a particular cellular antigen is obtained byhybridoma technique for monoclonal antibody production.These monoclonal antibodies, besides being specific  against\\nantigen, are highly sensitive in detection of antigeniccomponent, and, therefore, impart objectivity to thesubjective tumour diagnosis made by the surgicalpathologist.\\nThough the list of immunohistochemical stains is ever\\nincreasing, an important group of antibody stains directedagainst various classes of intermediate filaments is useful inclassification of poorly-differentiated tumours of epithelialor mesenchymal origin (Table 8.13).  This subject is discussed\\nalready in Chapter 2 and an abbreviated list of antibody stainsin some common cancers of unknown origin is given inTable 2.3.\\n5. Electron Microscopy\\nUltrastructural examination of tumour cells offers selective\\nrole in diagnostic pathology. EM examination may be helpfulin confirming or substantiating a tumour diagnosis arrivedat by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. A fewgeneral features of malignant tumour cells by EMexamination can be appreciated:\\ni)Cell junctions, their presence and type.\\nii\\n) Cell surface, e.g. presence of microvilli.\\niii) Cell shape and cytoplasmic extensions.iv) Shape of the nucleus and features of nuclear membrane.\\nv) Nucleoli, their size and density.vi) Cytoplasmic organelles—their number is generally\\nreduced.\\nvii)  Dense bodies in the cytoplasm.\\nviii) Any other secretory product in the cytoplasm e.g.\\nmelanosomes in melanoma and membrane-bound granulesin endocrine tumours.\\n6. Tumour Markers (Biochemical Assays)\\nIn order to distinguish from the preceding techniques of\\ntumour diagnosis in which ‘stains’ are imparted on thetumour cells in section or smear, tumour markers arebiochemical assays of products elaborated by the tumourcells in blood or other body fluids. It is, therefore, pertinentto keep in mind that many of these products are producedby normal body cells too, and thus the biochemical estimationof the product in blood or other fluid reflects the totalsubstance and not by the tumour cells alone. These methods,therefore, lack sensitivity as well as specificity and can onlybe employed for the following:\\nFirstly,  as an adjunct to the pathologic diagnosis arrived\\nat by other methods and not for primary diagnosis of cancer.\\nSecondly,  it can be used for prognostic and therapeutic\\npurposes.\\nTumour markers include: cell surface antigens (or\\noncofoetal antigens), cytoplasmic proteins, enzymes,234SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nhormones and cancer antigens; these are listed in Table 8.14.\\nHowever, two of the best known examples of oncofoetal\\nantigens secreted by foetal tissues as well as by tumours arealpha-foetoproteins (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigens(CEA):\\na)Alpha-foetoprotein (AFP):  This is a glycoprotein\\nsynthesised normally by foetal liver cells. Their serum levels\\nare elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumours of the testis. Certain non-neoplastic conditions also have increased serum levels of AFPe.g. in hepatitis, cirrhosis, toxic liver injury and pregnancy.\\nb\\n) Carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA):  CEA is also a\\nglycoprotein normally synthesised in embryonic tissue of the\\ngut, pancreas and liver. Their serum levels are high in cancersof the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and breast. As in AFP,CEA levels are also elevated in certain non-neoplasticconditions e.g. in ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, hepatitisand chronic bronchitis.7. Other Modern Aids in Pathologic\\nDiagnosis of T umours\\nIn addition to the methods described above, some othermodern diagnostic techniques have emerged for tumourdiagnostic pathology but their availability as well asapplicability are limited. These methods are discussed inChapter 2. Briefly, their role in tumour diagnosis is outlinedbelow.\\ni)F\\nlow cytometry.  This is a computerised technique by\\nwhich the detailed characteristics of individual tumour cells\\nare recognised and quantified and the data can be stored forsubsequent comparison too. Since for flow cytometry, single\\ncell suspensions are required to ‘flow’ through the\\n‘cytometer’, it can be employed on blood cells and theirprecursors in bone marrow aspirates and body fluids, andsometimes on fresh-frozen unfixed tissue. The method\\nemploys either identification of cell surface antigen (e.g. in\\nclassification of leukaemias and lymphomas), or by the DNAcontent analysis (e.g. aneuploidy in various cancers).\\nii)In situ  hybridisation . This is a molecular technique by\\nwhich nucleic acid sequences (cellular/viral DNA and RNA)\\ncan be localised by specifically-labelled nucleic acid probe\\ndirectly in the intact cell ( in situ ) rather than by DNA\\nextraction (see below). A modification of in situ hybridisation\\ntechnique is fluorescence in situ  hybridisation (FISH) in which\\nfluorescence dyes applied and is used to detectmicrodeletions, subtelomere deletions and to look foralterations in chromosomal numbers. In situ  hybridisation\\nmay be used for analysis of certain human tumours by the\\nstudy of oncogenes aside from its use in diagnosis of viral\\ninfection.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 8.14: Important Tumour Markers.\\nMarker Cancer\\n1.

The group of mole-\\ncular biologic methods in the tumour diagnostic laboratory\\nare a variety of DNA/RNA-based molecular techniques inwhich the DNA/RNA are extracted (compared from in situ\\nabove) from the cell and then analysed. These techniquesare highly sensitive, specific and rapid and haverevolutionised diagnostic pathology in neoplastic as well asnon-neoplastic conditions (e.g. in infectious and inheriteddisorders, and in identity diagnosis). Molecular diagnostictechniques include: DNA analysis by Southern blot, RNAanalysis by northern blot, and polymerase chain reaction(PCR). The following techniques of molecular methods intumour diagnosis have applications in haematologic as wellas non-haematologic malignancies:\\nAnalysis of molecular cytogenetic abnormalities\\nMutational analysis\\nAntigen receptor gene rearrangementStudy of oncogenic viruses at molecular level.\\nBesides the application of these molecular techniques for\\ndiagnosis of tumour, many of he newer molecular techniques\\nare being applied for predicting prognosis, biologicbehaviour of tumour, detection of minimal residual diseaseand for hereditary predisposition of other family membersto develop a particular cancer.\\niv) DNA microarray analysis of tumours. Currently, it is\\npossible to perform molecular profiling of a tumour by use\\nof gene chip technology which allows measurement of levelsof expression of several thousand genes (up-regulation ordown-regulation) simultaneously. Fluorescent labels areused to code the cDNA synthesised by trigger from mRNA.The conventional DNA probes are substituted by silicon chipwhich contains the entire range of genes and high resolutionscanners are used for the measurement.\\n❑236SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nChapter 9Chapter 9Environmental and\\nNutritional Diseases\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe subject of environmental hazards to health has assumed\\ngreat significance in the modern world. In olden times, the\\ndiscipline of ‘tropical medicine’ was of interest to the\\nphysician, largely due to contamination of air, food and water\\nby infectious and parasitic organisms. Subsequently, the\\ninterest got focussed on ‘geographic pathology’ due to\\noccurrence of certain environment-related diseases confined\\nto geographic boundaries. Then emerged the knowledge of\\n‘occupational diseases’ caused by overexposure to a pollutant\\nby virtue of an individual’s occupation. Currently, the field\\nof ‘environmental pathology’ encompasses all such diseases\\ncaused by progressive deterioration in the environment, most\\nof which is man-made. In addition, is the related problem of\\nover- and undernutrition.\\nSome of the important factors which have led to the\\nalarming environmental degradation are as under:\\n1. Population explosion\\n2. Urbanisation of rural and forest land to accommodate\\nthe increasing numbers\\n3. Accumulation of wastes\\n4. Unsatisfactory disposal of radioactive waste\\n5. Industrial effluents and automobile exhausts.\\nBut the above atmospheric pollutants appear relatively\\nminor compared with voluntary intake of three pollutants—use\\nof tobacco, consumption of alcohol and intoxicant drugs. TheWHO estimates that 80% cases of cardiovascular disease and\\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus, and 40% of all cancers are\\npreventable through ‘three pillars of prevention’: avoidance\\nof tobacco, healthy diet and physical activity. The WHO has\\nfurther determined that about a quarter of global burden of\\ndiseases and 23% of all deaths are related to modifiable\\nenvironmental factors. Infant mortality related to\\nenvironmental factors in developing countries is 12 times\\nhigher than in the developed countries.\\nAttempts at prohibition of alcohol in some states in India\\nhave not been quite effective due to difficulty in implemen-\\ntation. Instead, prohibition has only resulted in off and on\\ncatastrophe of ‘hooch tragedies’ in some parts of this country\\ndue to illicit liquor consumption.\\nThe present discussion on environmental and nutritional\\ndiseases is covered under the following groups:\\n1.Environmental pollution:\\nAir pollution\\nTobacco smoking\\n2.Chemical and drug injury:\\nTherapeutic (iatrogenic) drug injuryNon-therapeutic toxic agents (e.g. alcohol, lead, carbon\\nmonoxide, drug abuse)\\nEnvironmental chemicals\\n3.Injury by physical agents:\\nThermal and electrical injury\\nInjury by ionising radiation\\n4.Nutritional diseases:\\nOvernutrition (obesity)\\nUndernutrition (starvation, protein energy malnutrition,\\nvitamin deficiencies).\\nENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION\\nAny agent—chemical, physical or microbial, that alters the\\ncomposition of environment is called pollutant. For survivalof mankind, it is important to prevent depletion of ozonelayer (O\\n3) in the outer space from pollutants such as\\nchloroflurocarbons and nitrogen dioxide produced inabundance by day-to-day activities on our planet earth dueto industrial effluent and automobile exhausts.\\nAIR POLLUTION\\nA vast variety of pollutants are inhaled daily, some of which\\nmay cause trivial irritation to the upper respiratory path-ways, while others may lead to acute or chronic injury to the\\nlungs, and some are implicated in causation of lung cancer.\\nWhereas some pollutants are prevalent in certain industries(such as coal dust, silica, asbestos), others are general\\npollutants present widespread in the ambient atmosphere\\n(e.g. sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide).The latter group of environmental pollutants is acted upon\\nby sunlight to produce secondary pollutants such as ozone\\nand free radicals capable of oxidant cell injury to respiratorypassages. In highly polluted cities where coal consumption\\nand automobile exhaust accumulate in the atmosphere, the\\nair pollutants become visible as ‘smog’. It has been reportedthat 6 out of 10 largest cities in India have such severe air\\npollution problem that the annual level of suspended\\nparticles is about three times higher than the WHO standards.An estimated 50,000 persons die prematurely every year due\\nto high level of pollution in these cities.\\nThe adverse effects of air pollutants on lung depend upon\\na few variables that include:\\nlonger duration of exposure;\\ntotal dose of exposure;\\nimpaired ability of the host to clear inhaled particles; and\\nparticle size of 1-5 μm capable of getting impacted in the\\ndistal airways to produce tissue injury.237CHAPTER 9 Environmental and Nutritional DiseasesPneumoconiosis—the group of lung diseases due to\\noccupational over-exposure to pollutants is discussed in\\nChapter 17.\\nTOBACCO SMOKING\\nHabit s\\nTobacco smoking is the most prevalent and preventable cause\\nof disease and death. The harmful effects of smoking pipe\\nand cigar are somewhat less. Long-term smokers of filter-\\ntipped cigarettes appear to have 30-50% lower risk of\\ndevelopment of cancer due to reduced inhalation of tobacco\\nsmoke constituents.\\nIn India, a country of 1.2 billion people, a quarter (300\\nmillion) are tobacco users in one form or the other (Fig. 9.1).\\nSmoking bidis  and chewing pan masala , zarda  and gutka  are\\nmore widely practiced than cigarettes. Habit of smoking\\nchutta  (a kind of indigenous cigar) in which the lighted end\\nis put in mouth is practiced in the Indian state of AndhraPradesh and is associated with higher incidence of squamous\\ncell carcinoma of hard palate. Another habit prevalent in\\nIndian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and in parts of Sri\\nLanka is chewing of tabacco alone or mixed with slaked lime\\nas a bolus of paan  kept in mouth for long hours which is the\\nmajor cause of cancer of upper aerodigestive tract and oralcavity.  Hookah  smoking, in which tobacco smoke passes\\nthrough a water-filled chamber which cools the smoke beforeit is inhaled by the smoker, is believed by some reports to\\ndeliver less tar and nicotine than cigarettes and hence fewer\\ntobacco-related health consequences. In view of serious\\nhealth hazards of tobacco, India has recently succeeded in\\nenacting a law with effect from 2nd October 2008, Mahatma\\nGandhi’s birth anniversary, banning smoking at all public\\nplaces, imposing world’s biggest smoking ban. If implemen-\\ntation of this ban is effective, it is likely to have a favourable\\nimpact in coming years on the public health in this populous\\ncountry. In US, Canada and most European countries, health\\nawareness by people has resulted in decline in tobacco\\nsmoking by about 20%.\\nBesides the harmful effects of smoking on active smokers\\nthemselves, involuntary exposure of smoke to bystanders\\n(passive smoking) is also injurious to health, particularly to\\ninfants and children.Dose and Duration\\nTobacco contains several harmful constituents which include\\nnicotine, many carcinogens, carbon monoxide and othertoxins (Table 9.1).\\nThe harmful effects of smoking are related to a variety of\\nfactors, the most important of which is dose of exposureexpressed in terms of pack years. For example, one pack ofcigarettes daily for 5 years means 5 pack years. It is estimatedthat a person who smokes 2 packs of cigarettes daily at theage of 30 years reduces his life by 8 years than a non-smoker.On cessation of smoking, the higher mortality slowly declinesand the beneficial effect reaches the level of non-smokers after20 or more of smoke-free years.\\nTobacco-Related Diseases\\nTobacco contains numerous toxic chemicals having adverse\\neffects varying from minor throat irritation to carcinogenesis.Some of the important constituents of tobacco smoke withadverse effects are given in Table 9.1.\\nThe major diseases accounting for higher mortality in\\ntobacco smokers include the following (in descending orderof frequency):i)Coronary heart disease\\ni\\ni) Cancer of the lung\\niii) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\\nBesides above, smokers suffer higher risk of development\\nof a few other cancers and non-neoplastic conditions asillustrated in Fig. 9.2.\\nCORONARY HEART DISEASE.  Cigarette smoking is one\\nof the four major risk factors for myocardial infarction andacts synergistically with the other three—hypercholes-terolaemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus (Chapter 15).There is more severe, extensive and accelerated athero-sclerosis of coronary arteries and aorta in smokers, possiblydue to increased platelet aggregation and impaired lungfunction that causes reduced myocardial oxygen supply.Besides, the smokers have higher risk of development ofatherosclerotic aortic aneurysm and Buerger’s disease(thromboangiitis obliterans) affecting lower extremities(Chapter 15).\\nLUNG CANCER.  This is the most common cancer in men\\nthroughout world and most frequent cancer in women too\\nFigure 9.1 Consumption of tobacco in India as estimated by weight\\n(Source:  National Council of Applied Economic Research, New Delhi).\\uf075\\uf075TABLE 9.1: Major Constituents of Tobacco Smoke with\\nAdverse Effects.\\nAdverse Effect Constituents\\n1.

These are broadly divided into the following threecategories:\\nTherapeutic (iatrogenic) agents  e.g. drugs, which when\\nadministered indiscriminately are associated with adverseeffects.\\nNon-therapeutic agents  e.g. alcohol, lead, carbon monoxide,\\ndrug abuse.Environmental chemicals  e.g. long-term or accidental\\nexposure to certain man-made or naturally-occurringchemicals.\\nTHERAPEUTIC (IATROGENIC) DRUG INJURY\\nThough the basis of patient management is rational drug\\ntherapy, nevertheless adverse drug reactions do occur in 2-5% of patients. In general, the risk of adverse drug reactionincreases with increasing number of drugs administered.Adverse effects of drugs may appear due to:\\noverdose;\\ngenetic predisposition;\\nexaggerated pharmacologic response;\\ninteraction with other drugs; and\\nunknown factors.It is beyond the scope of this book to delve into the list of\\ndrugs with their harmful effects. However, some of thecommon forms of iatrogenic drug injury and the offendingdrugs are listed in Table 9.2.\\nNON-THERAPEUTIC T OXIC AGENTS\\nALCOHOLISM\\nChronic alcoholism is defined as the regular imbibing of an\\namount of ethy l alcohol (ethanol) that is sufficient to harm\\nan individual socially, psychologically or physically. It is\\ndifficult to give the number of ‘drinks’ after which the\\ndiagnosis of alcoholism can be made because of differences\\nin individual susceptibility. However, adverse effects—acuteas well as chronic, are related to the quantity of alcohol\\ncontent imbibed and duration of consumption. Generally,\\n10 gm of ethanol is present in:\\na can of beer (or half a bottle of beer);\\n120 ml of neat wine; or\\n30 ml of 43% liquor (small peg).A daily consumption of 40 gm of ethanol (4 small pegs\\nor 2 large pegs) is likely to be harmful but intake of 100 gmor more daily is certainly dangerous. Daily and heavyconsumption of alcohol is more harmful than moderate social\\ndrinking since the liver, where ethanol is metabolised, gets\\ntime to heal.\\nMetabolism\\nAbsorption of alcohol begins in the stomach and small\\nintestine and appears in blood shortly after ingestion. Alcoholis then distributed to different organs and body fluids\\nproportionate to the blood levels of alcohol. About 2-10% of\\nabsorbed alcohol is excreted via urine, sweat and exhaledthrough breath, the last one being the basis of breath test\\nemployed by law-enforcement agencies for alcohol abuse.\\nMetabolism of alcohol is discussed in detail in Chapter 21;in brief alcohol is metabolised in the liver by the following 3\\npathways (Fig. 9.3):\\nBy the major rate-limiting pathway of alcohol\\ndehydrogenase (ADH) in the cytosol, which is then quicklydestroyed by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), especiallywith low blood alcohol levels.\\nFigure 9.2 Major adverse effects of tobacco smoking. Right  side\\nshows smoking-related neoplastic diseases while left side  indicates non-\\nneoplastic diseases associated with smoking, numbered serially in order\\nof frequency of occurrence.239CHAPTER 9 Environmental and Nutritional Diseases\\nVia microsomal P-450 system (microsomal ethanol\\noxidising system, MEOS) when the blood alcohol level is\\nhigh.\\nMinor pathway via catalase from peroxisomes.In any of the three pathways, ethanol is biotransformed\\nto toxic acetaldehyde in the liver and finally to carbon dioxide\\nand water by acetyl coenzyme A.\\nIll-Effects of Alcoholism\\nAlcohol consumption in moderation and socially acceptable\\nlimits is practiced mainly for its mood-altering effects. Heavy\\nalcohol consumption in unhabituated person is likely to causeacute ill-effects on different organs. Though the diseases\\nassociated with alcoholism are discussed in respective\\nchapters later, the spectrum of ill-effects are outlined below.\\nA. ACUTE ALCOHOLISM.  The acute effects of inebriation\\nare most prominent on the central nervous system but it also\\ninjures the stomach and liver.\\n1.Central nervous system.  Alcohol acts as a CNS depres-\\nsant; the intensity of effects of alcohol on the CNS are related\\nto the quantity consumed and duration over whichconsumed, which are reflected by the blood levels of alcohol:\\nInitial effect of alcohol is on subcortical structures which\\nis followed by disordered cortical function, motor ataxia andbehavioural changes. These changes are apparent whenblood alcohol levels do not exceed 100 mg/dl  which is the\\nupper limit of sobriety in drinking as defined by law-enforcing agencies in most Western countries while dealingwith cases of driving in drunken state.\\nBlood levels of 100-200 mg/dl  are associated with\\ndepression of cortical centres, lack of coordination, impairedjudgement and drowsiness.\\nStupor and coma supervene when blood alcohol levels\\nare about 300 mg/dl.\\nBlood levels of alcohol above  400 mg/dl  can cause\\nanaesthesia, depression of medullary centre and death fromrespiratory arrest.\\nHowever, chronic alcoholics develop CNS tolerance and\\nadaptation and, therefore, can withstand higher blood levelsof alcohol without such serious effects.\\n2. Stomach.  Acute alcohol intoxication may cause vomiting,\\nacute gastritis and peptic ulceration.3. Liver.  Acute alcoholic injury to the liver is explained in\\nChapter 21.\\nB. CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM.  Chronic alcoholism\\nproduces widespread injury to organs and systems. Contrary\\nto the earlier belief that chronic alcoholic injury results from\\nnutritional deficiencies, it is now known that most of the\\nalcohol-related injury to different organs is due to toxic effectsof alcohol and accumulation of its main toxic metabolite,\\nacetaldehyde, in the blood. Other proposed mechanisms of\\ntissue injury in chronic alcoholism is free-radical mediatedinjury and genetic susceptibility to alcohol-dependence and\\ntissue damage.\\nSome of the more important organ effects in chronic\\nalcoholism are as under  (Fig. 9.4):\\n1.

Peripheral neuropathies and\\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, cerebral atrophy, cerebellar\\ndegeneration and amblyopia (impaired vision) are seen inchronic alcoholics.\\n5. Cardiovascular system.  Alcoholic cardiomyopathy and\\nbeer-drinkers’ myocardiosis with consequent dilated\\ncardiomyopathy may occur. Level of HDL (atherosclerosis-protective lipoprotein), however, has been shown to increasewith moderate consumption of alcohol.\\n6. Endocrine system.  In men, testicular atrophy, femi-\\nnisation, loss of libido and potency, and gynaecomastia may\\ndevelop. These effects appear to be due to lowering oftestosterone levels.\\n7. Blood.  Haematopoietic dysfunction with secondary\\nmegaloblastic anaemia and increased red blood cell volume\\nmay occur.\\n8. Immune system. Alcoholics are more susceptible to\\nvarious infections.\\n9. Cancer.  There is higher incidence of cancers of upper\\naerodigestive tract in chronic alcoholics but the mechanism\\nis not clear.\\nLEAD POISONING\\nLead poisoning may occur in children or adults due to\\naccidental or occupational ingestion.\\nIn children,  following are the main sources of lead poisoning:\\nChewing of lead-containing furniture items, toys or\\npencils.\\nEating of lead paint flakes from walls.\\nIn adults,  the sources are as follows:\\nOccupational exposure to lead during spray painting,\\nrecycling of automobile batteries (lead oxide fumes), mining,\\nand extraction of lead.\\nAccidental exposure by contaminated water supply,\\nhouse freshly coated with lead paint, and sniffing of lead-containing petrol (hence unleaded petrol introduced as fuel).\\nLead is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract or\\nlungs. The absorbed lead is distributed in two types of tissues(Fig. 9.5):\\na)Bones, teeth, nails and hair  representing relatively harmless\\npool of lead. About 90% of absorbed lead accumulates in the\\ndeveloping metaphysis of bones in children and appears asareas of increased bone densities (‘lead lines’) on X-ray. Leadlines are also seen in the gingiva.\\nFigure 9.3 Metabolism of ethanol in the liver. Thickness and intensity of colour of arrow on left side of figure corresponds to extent of metabolic\\npathway followed (MEOS = Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system; ADH-alcohol dehydrogenase; ALDH = aldehyde dehydrogenase; NAD=nic otinamide\\nadenine dinucleotide; NADH = reduced NAD; NADP = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPH = reduced NADP).\\nFigure 9.4 Complications of chronic alcoholism.241CHAPTER 9 Environmental and Nutritional Diseases\\nb)Brain, liver, kidneys and bone marrow  accumulate the\\nremaining 10% lead which is directly toxic to these organs.\\nIt is excreted via kidneys.\\nLead toxicity occurs in the following organs predo-\\nminantly:\\n1. Nervous system:  The changes are as under:\\nIn children,  lead encephalopathy; oedema of brain,\\nflattening of gyri and compression of ventricles.\\nIn adults,  demyelinating peripheral motor neuropathy\\nwhich typically affects radial and peroneal nerves resulting\\nin wristdrop and footdrop respectively.\\n2. Haematopoietic system:  The changes in blood are quite\\ncharacteristic:\\nMicrocytic hypochromic anaemia  due to inhibition of two\\nenzymes: delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydrogenase required\\nfor haem synthesis, and through inhibition of ferroketolaserequired for incorporation of ferrous iron into the porphyrinring.\\nProminent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes.\\n3. Kidneys:  Lead is toxic to proximal tubular cells of the\\nkidney and produces lead nephropathy  characterised by\\naccumulation of intranuclear inclusion bodies consisting oflead-protein complex in the proximal tubular cells.\\n4. Gastrointestinal tract:  Lead toxicity in the bowel\\nmanifests as acute abdomen presenting as lead colic.\\nCARBON MONOXIDE POISONING\\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless and odourless gas\\nproduced by incomplete combustion of carbon. Sources ofCO gas are:\\nautomobile exhaust;burning of fossil fuel in industries or at home; and\\ntobacco smoke.\\nCO is an important cause of accidental death due to\\nsystemic oxygen deprivation of tissues. This is because\\nhaemoglobin has about 200-times higher affinity for CO than\\nfor O2 and thus varying amount of carboxyhaemoglobin is\\nformed depending upon the extent of CO poisoning. Besides,carboxyhaemoglobin interferes with the release of O\\n2 from\\noxyhaemoglobin causing further aggravation of tissuehypoxia. Diagnosis of CO poisoning is, therefore, best\\nconfirmed by carboxyhaemoglobin levels in the blood.\\nCO poisoning may present in 2 ways:\\nAcute CO poisoning  in which there is sudden\\ndevelopment of brain hypoxia characterised by oedema and\\npetechial haemorrhages.\\nChronic CO poisoning  presents with nonspecific changes\\nof slowly developing hypoxia of the brain.\\nDRUG ABUSE\\nDrug abuse is defined as the use of certain drugs for the\\npurpose of ‘mood alteration’ or ‘euphoria’ or ‘kick’ but\\nsubsequently leading to habit-forming, dependence and\\neventually addiction. Some of the commonly abused drugs\\nand substances are as under:\\n1.Marijuana  or ‘pot’ is psychoactive substance most widely\\nused. It is obtained from the leaves of the plant Cannabis sativa\\nand contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It may be smoked\\nor ingested.2.Derivatives of opium  that includes heroin and morphine.\\nOpioids are derived from the poppy plant. Heroin andmorphine are self-administered intravenously or\\nsubcutaneously.\\n3.CNS depressants  include barbiturates, tranquilisers and\\nalcohol.4.CNS stimulants  e.g. cocaine and amphetamines.\\n5.Psychedelic drugs  (meaning enjoyable perception-giving)\\ne.g. LSD.\\n6.lnhalants  e.g. glue, paint thinner, nail polish remover,\\naerosols, amyl nitrite.\\nIt is beyond the scope of the present discussion to go into\\nthe pharmacologic actions of all these substances. However,apart from pharmacologic and physiologic actions of these\\nstreet drugs, the most common complication is introduction\\nof infection by parenteral use of many of these drugs. Sharing\\nof needles by the drug-addicts accounts for high risk of most\\nfeared viral infections in them, AIDS and viral hepatitis (both\\nHBV and HCV). Following are a few common drug abuse-\\nrelated infectious complications:\\n1.At the site of injection—cellulitis, abscesses, ulcers,\\nthrombosed veins2.\\nThrombophlebitis\\n3. Bacterial endocarditis4. High risk for AIDS\\n5. Viral hepatitis and its complications\\n6. Focal glomerulonephritis\\n7. Talc (foreign body) granuloma formation in the lungs.\\nFigure 9.5 Complications of lead poisoning.242SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS\\nA large number of chemicals are found as contaminants in\\nthe ecosystem, food and water supply and find their wayinto the food chain of man. These substances exert their toxiceffects depending upon their mode of absorption,distribution, metabolism and excretion. Some of thesubstances are directly toxic while others cause ill-effects viatheir metabolites. Environmental chemicals may have slowdamaging effect or there may be sudden accidental exposuresuch as the Bhopal gas tragedy in India due to accidentalleakage of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas in December 1984.\\nSome of the common examples of environmental\\nchemicals are given below:\\n1.Agriculture chemicals.  Modern agriculture thrives on\\npesticides, fungicides, herbicides and organic fertilisers\\nwhich may pose a potential acute poisoning as well as long-term hazard. The problem is particularly alarming indeveloping countries like India, China and Mexico wherefarmers and their families are unknowingly exposed to thesehazardous chemicals during aerial spraying of crops.\\nAcute poisoning by organophosphate insecticides is quite\\nwell known in India as accidental or suicidal poison byinhibiting acetyl cholinesterase and sudden death.\\nChronic human exposure to low level agricultural\\nchemicals is implicated in cancer, chronic degenerativediseases, congenital malformations and impotence but theexact cause-and-effect relationship is lacking.\\nAccording to the WHO estimates, about 7.5 lakh people\\nare taken ill every year worldwide with pesticide poisoning,half of which occur in the developing countries due to readyavailability and indiscriminate use of hazardous pesticideswhich are otherwise banned in advanced countries. Pesticideresidues in food items such as in fruits, vegetables, cereals,grains, pulses etc is of greatest concern.\\n2. Volatile organic solvents.  Volatile organic solvents and\\nvapours are used in industry quite commonly and their\\nexposure may cause acute toxicity or chronic hazard, oftenby inhalation than by ingestion. Such substances includemethanol, chloroform, petrol, kerosene, benzene, ethyleneglycol, toluene etc.\\n3. Metals.  Pollution by occupational exposure to toxic\\nmetals such as mercury, arsenic, cadmium, iron, nickel and\\naluminium are important hazardous environmentalchemicals.\\n4. Aromatic hydrocarbons.  The halogenated aromatic\\nhydrocarbons containing polychlorinated biphenyl which are\\ncontaminant in several preservatives, herbicides andantibacterial agents are a chronic health hazard.\\n5. Cyanide.  Cyanide in the environment is released by\\ncombustion of plastic, silk and is also present in cassava and\\nthe seeds of apricots and wild cherries. Cyanide is a verytoxic chemical and kills by blocking cellular respiration bybinding to mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase.\\n6. Environmental dusts.  These substances causing\\npneumoconioses are discussed in chapter 17 while those\\nimplicated in cancer are discussed in Chapter 8.INJURY BY PHYSICAL AGENTS\\nTHERMAL AND ELECTRICAL INJURY\\nThermal and electrical burns, fall in body temperature below\\n35°C (hypothermia) and elevation of body temperature above41°C (hyperthermia), are all associated with tissue injury.\\nHypothermia  may cause focal injury as in frostbite, or\\nsystemic injury and death as occurs on immersion in coldwater for varying time.\\nHyperthermia  likewise, may be localised as in cutaneous\\nburns, and systemic as occurs in fevers.\\nThermal burns  depending upon severity are categorised\\ninto full thickness (third degree) and partial thickness (firstand second degree). The most serious complications of burnsare haemoconcentration, infections and contractures onhealing.\\nElectrical burns  may cause damage firstly,  by electrical\\ndysfunction of the conduction system of the heart and deathby ventricular fibrillation, and secondly  by heat produced by\\nelectrical energy.\\nINJURY BY RADIATION\\nAs discussed in the preceding chapter, the most important\\nform of radiation injury is ionising radiation which has threetypes of effects on cells:\\ni)Somatic effects which cause acute cell killing.\\ni\\ni) Genetic damage by mutations and therefore, passes\\ngenetic defects in the next progeny of cells.\\niii) Malignant transformation of cells (Chapter 8).\\nIonising radiation is widely employed for diagnostic\\npurpose as well as for radiotherapy of malignant tumours.\\nRadiation-induced cell death is mediated by radiolysis ofwater in the cell with generation of toxic hydroxyl radicals(page 32). During radiotherapy, some normal cells comingin the field of radiation are also damaged. In general,radiation-induced tissue injury predominantly affectsendothelial cells of small arteries and arterioles, causingnecrosis and ischaemia.\\nIonising radiation causes damage to the following major\\norgans:1.Skin:  radiation dermatitis, cancer.\\n2.Lungs:  interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.\\n3.Heart:  myocardial fibrosis, constrictive pericarditis.\\n4.Kidney:  radiation nephritis.\\n5.Gastrointestinal tract:  strictures of small bowel and\\noesophagus.6Gonads:  testicular atrophy in males and destruction of\\novaries.7.Haematopoietic tissue:  pancytopenia due to bone marrow\\ndepression.8.Eyes:  cataract.\\nBesides ionising radiation, other form of harmful\\nradiation is solar (u.v.) radiation which may cause acute skin\\ninjury as sunburns, chronic conditions such as solar keratosisand early onset of cataracts in the eyes. It may, however, bementioned in passing here that electromagnetic radiation243CHAPTER 9 Environmental and Nutritional Diseasesproduced by microwaves (ovens, radars, diathermy) or\\nultrasound waves used for diagnostic purposes do notproduce ionisation and thus are not known to cause anytissue injury.\\nNUTRITIONAL DISEASES\\nNutritional status of a society varies according to the socio-economic conditions. In the Western world, nutritionalimbalance is more often a problem accounting for increasedfrequency of obesity, while in developing countries of Africa,Asia and South America, chronic malnutrition is a serioushealth problem, particularly in children.\\nBefore describing the nutritional diseases, it is essential\\nto know the components of normal and adequate nutrition.For good health, humans require energy-providing nutrients(proteins, fats and carbohydrates), vitamins, minerals, waterand some non-essential nutrients.\\n1. Energy.  The requirement of energy by the body is\\ncalculated in Kcal per day. In order to retain stable weight\\nand undertake day-to-day activities, the energy intake mustmatch the energy output. The average requirement of energyfor an individual is estimated by the formula: 900+10w formales, and 700+7w for females (where w stands for theweight of the individual in kilograms).  Since the requirementof energy varies according to the level of physical activitiesperformed  by the person, the figure arrived at by the above\\nformula is multiplied by: 1.2 for sedentary person, 1.4 formoderately active person and 1.8 for very active person.\\n2. Proteins.  Dietary proteins provide the body with amino\\nacids for endogenous protein synthesis and are also a\\nmetabolic fuel for energy (1 g of protein provides 4 Kcal).Nine essential amino acids  (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine,\\nmethionine/cystine, phenylalanine/tyrosine, theonine,tryptophan and valine) must be supplied by dietary intakeas these cannot be synthesised in the body. Therecommended average requirement of proteins for an adultis 0.6 g/kg of the desired weight per day. For a healthyperson, 10-14% of caloric requirement should come fromproteins.\\n3. Fats.  Fats and fatty acids (in particular linolenic, linoleic\\nand arachidonic acid) should comprise about 35% of diet. In\\norder to minimise the risk of atherosclerosis, poly-unsaturated fats should be limited to <10% of calories andsaturated fats and trans-fats should comprise <10% of calorieswhile monounsaturated fats to constitute the remainder offat intake (1 g of fat yields 9 Kcal).\\n4. Carbohydrates.  Dietary carbohydrates, are the major\\nsource of dietary calories, especially  for the brain, RBCs and\\nmuscles (1 g of carbohydrate provides 4 Kcal). At least 55%of total caloric requirement should be derived fromcarbohydrates.\\n5. Vitamins.  These are mainly derived from exogenous\\ndietary sources and are essential for maintaining the normal\\nstructure and function of cells. A healthy individual requires4 fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) and 11 water-solublevitamins (C, B\\n1/thiamine, B2/riboflavin, B3/niacin/nicotinicacid, B5/pantothenic acid, B6/pyridoxine, folate/folic acid,\\nB12/ cyanocobalamin, choline, biotin, and flavonoids).\\nVitamin deficiencies result in individual deficiencysyndromes, or may be part of a multiple deficiency state.\\n6. Minerals.  A number of minerals like iron, calcium, phos-\\nphorus and certain trace elements (e.g. zinc, copper,\\nselenium, iodine, chlorine, sodium, potassium, magnesium,manganese, cobalt, molybdenum etc) are essential for health.Their deficiencies result in a variety of lesions and deficiencysyndromes.\\n7. Water.  Water intake is essential to cover the losses in\\nfaeces, urine, exhalation and insensible loss so as to avoid\\nunder- or over-hydration. Although body’s water needsvaries according to physical activities and weatherconditions, average requirement of water is 1.0-1.5 ml water/Kcal of energy spent. Infants and pregnant women haverelatively higher requirements of water.\\n8. Non-essential nutrients.  Dietary fibre composed of\\ncellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, though considered non-\\nessential, are important due to their beneficial effects inlowering the risk of colonic cancer, diabetes and coronaryartery disease.\\nPathogenesis of Deficiency Diseases\\nThe nutritional deficiency disease develops when the\\nessential nutrients are not provided to the cells adequately.The nutritional deficiency may be of 2 types:\\n1. Primary deficiency.  This is due to either the lack or\\ndecreased amount of essential nutrients in diet.2. Secondary or conditioned deficiency.  Secondary or\\nconditioned deficiency is malnutrition occurring as a result\\nof the various factors. These are as under:i)Interference with ingestion  e.g. in gastrointestinal disorders\\nsuch as malabsorption syndrome, chronic alcoholism,neuropsychiatric illness, anorexia, food allergy, pregnancy.\\nii)Interference with absorption  e.g. in hypermotility of the gut,\\nachlorhydria, biliary disease.iii)Interference with utilisation  e.g. in liver dysfunction,\\nmalignancy, hypothyroidism.\\niv)Increased excretion  e.g. in lactation, perspiration, polyuria.\\nv)Increased nutritional demand\\n e.g. in fever, pregnancy,\\nlactation, hyperthyroidism.\\nIrrespective of the type of nutritional deficiency (primary\\nor secondary), nutrient reserves in the tissues begin to getdepleted, which initially result in biochemical alterations andeventually lead to functional and morphological changes in\\ntissues and organs.\\nIn the following pages, a brief account of nutritional imba-\\nlance (viz.  obesity ) is followed by description of multiple or\\nmixed deficiencies (e.g. starvation, protein-energy malnutrition )\\nand individual nutrient deficiencies (e.g. vitamin deficiencies ).\\nOBESITY\\nDietary imbalance and overnutrition may lead to diseases\\nlike obesity. Obesity is defined as an excess of adipose tissue that\\nimparts health risk; a body weight of 20% excess over ideal weight244SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesfor age, sex and height is considered a health risk. The most widely\\nused method to gauge obesity is body mass index (BMI)\\nwhich is equal to weight in kg/height in m2. A cut off BMI\\nvalue of 30 is used for obesity in both men and women.\\nETIOLOGY.  Obesity results when caloric intake exceeds utili-\\nsation . The imbalance of these two components can occur in\\nthe following situations:\\n1.Inadequate pushing of oneself away from the dining table\\ncausing overeating.2.Insufficient pushing of oneself out of the chair  leading to\\ninactivity and sedentary life style.\\n3.Genetic predisposition  to develop obesity.\\n4.Diets largely derived from carbohydrates  and fats than\\nprotein-rich diet.5.Secondary obesity  may result following a number of under-\\nlying diseases such as hypothyroidism, Cushing’s disease,\\ninsulinoma and hypothalamic disorders.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The lipid storing cells, adipocytes\\ncomprise the adipose tissue, and are present in vascular and\\nstromal compartment in the body. Besides the generally\\naccepted role of adipocytes for fat storage, these cells also\\nrelease endocrine-regulating molecules. These moleculesinclude: energy regulatory hormone (leptin), cytokines\\n(TNF- α and interleukin-6), insulin sensitivity regulating\\nagents (adiponectin, resistin and RBP4), prothrombotic\\nfactors (plasminogen activator inhibitor), and blood pressure\\nregulating agent (angiotensingen).\\nAdipose mass is increased due to enlargement of adipose\\ncells due to excess of intracellular lipid deposition as well asdue to increase in the number of adipocytes. The most\\nimportant environmental factor of excess consumption ofnutrients can lead to obesity. However, underlying molecular\\nmechanisms of obesity are beginning to unfold based on\\nobservations that obesity is familial and is seen in identicaltwins. Recently, two obesity genes have been found: ob gene\\nand its protein product leptin, and db gene and its protein\\nproduct leptin receptor.\\nSEQUELAE OF OBESITY.  Marked obesity is a serious health\\nhazard and may predispose to a number of clinical disorders\\nand pathological changes described below and illustrated inFig. 9.6.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Obesity is associated with\\nincreased adipose stores in the subcutaneous tissues,\\nskeletal muscles, internal organs such as the kidneys,heart, liver and omentum; fatty liver is also more commonin obese individuals. There is increase in both size andnumber of adipocytes i.e. there is hypertrophy as well ashyperplasia.\\nMETABOLIC CHANGES.  These are as under:\\n1.Hyperinsulinaemia.  Increased insulin secretion is a\\nfeature of obesity. Many obese individuals exhibit hyper-glycaemia or frank diabetes despite hyperinsulinaemia. Thisis due to a state of insulin-resistance consequent to tissueinsensitivity.2.\\nType 2 diabetes mellitus.  There is a strong association\\nof type 2 diabetes mellitus with obesity. Obesity oftenexacerbates the diabetic state and in many cases weightreduction often leads to amelioration of diabetes.\\n3. Hypertension.  A strong association between hyperten-\\nsion and obesity is observed which is perhaps due to\\nincreased blood volume. Weight reduction leads tosignificant reduction in systolic blood pressure.\\n4. Hyperlipoproteinaemia.  The plasma cholesterol circu-\\nlates in the blood as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) containing\\nmost of the circulating triglycerides. Obesity is stronglyassociated with VLDL and mildly with LDL. Total bloodcholesterol levels are also elevated in obesity.\\n5. Atherosclerosis.  Obesity predisposes to development of\\natherosclerosis. As a result of atherosclerosis and\\nhypertension, there is increased risk of myocardial infarctionand stroke in obese individuals.\\n6. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  Obesity\\ncontributes to development of NAFLD which may progress\\nfurther to cirrhosis of the liver.\\n7. Cholelithiasis.  There is six times higher incidence of\\ngallstones in obese persons, mainly due to increased total\\nbody cholesterol.\\n8. Hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome).\\nThis is characterised by hypersomnolence, both at night andduring day in obese individuals along with carbon dioxideretention, hypoxia, polycythaemia and eventually right-sidedheart failure. (Mr Pickwick was a character, the fat boy, in\\nFigure 9.6 Major sequelae of obesity.245CHAPTER 9 Environmental and Nutritional DiseasesCharles Dickens’ Pickwick Papers . The term pickwickian\\nsyndrome was first used by Sir William Osler for the sleep-\\napnoea syndrome).\\n9. Osteoarthritis.  These individuals are more prone to\\ndevelop degenerative joint disease due to wear and tear\\nfollowing trauma to joints as a result of large body weight.\\n10. Cancer. Diet rich in fats, particularly derived from animal\\nfats and meats, is associated with higher incidence of cancersof colon, breast, endometrium and prostate.\\nSTARVATION\\nStarvation is a state of overall deprivation of nutrients. Its\\ncauses may be the following:i)deliberate fasting—religious or political;\\ni\\ni) famine conditions in a country or community; or\\niii) secondary undernutrition such as due to chronic wastingdiseases (infections, inflammatory conditions, liver disease),cancer etc. Cancer results in malignant cachexia as a resultof which cytokines are elaborated e.g. tumour necrosis factor-α, elastases, proteases etc.\\nA starved individual has lax, dry skin, wasted muscles\\nand atrophy of internal organs.\\nMETABOLIC CHANGES.  The following metabolic changes\\ntake place in starvation:\\n1.Glucose.  Glucose stores  of the body are sufficient for one\\nday’s metabolic needs only. During fasting state, insulin-\\nindependent tissues such as the brain, blood cells and renalmedulla continue to utilise glucose while insulin-dependenttissues like muscle stop taking up glucose. This results inrelease of glycogen stores of the liver to maintain normalblood glucose level. Subsequently, hepatic gluconeogenesisfrom other sources such as breakdown of proteins takes place.\\n2.Proteins.  Protein stores and the triglycerides of adipose\\ntissue have enough energy for about 3 months in an\\nindividual. Proteins  breakdown to release amino acids which\\nare used as fuel for hepatic gluconeogenesis so as to maintainglucose needs of the brain. This results in nitrogen imbalancedue to excretion of nitrogen compounds as urea.\\n3\\n. Fats.  After about one week of starvation, protein\\nbreakdown is decreased while triglycerides  of adipose tissue\\nbreakdown to form glycerol and fatty acids. The fatty acids\\nare converted into ketone bodies in the liver which are usedby most organs including brain in place of glucose. Starvationcan then continue till all the body fat stores are exhaustedfollowing which death occurs.\\nPROTEIN-ENERGY MALNUTRITION\\nThe inadequate consumption of protein and energy as a result\\nof primary dietary deficiency or conditioned deficiency maycause loss of body mass and adipose tissue, resulting inprotein energy or protein calorie malnutrition (PEM or PCM).The primary deficiency is more frequent due tosocioeconomic factors limiting the quantity and quality ofdietary intake, particularly prevalent in the developingcountries of Africa, Asia and South America. The impact ofdeficiency is marked in infants and children.\\nFigure 9.7 Two forms of PEM.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 9.3: Contrasting Features of Kwashiorkor and Marasmus.\\nFeature Kwashiorkor Marasmus\\nDefinition Protein deficiency with sufficient calorie intake Starvation in infants with overall lack of calories\\nClinical features Occurs in children between 6 months and 3 years Common in infants under 1 year of age\\n(Fig. 9.7) of age\\nGrowth failure Growth failureWasting of muscles but preserved adipose tissues Wasting of all tissues including muscles and adipose\\ntissues\\nOedema, localised or generalised, present Oedema absentEnlarged fatty liver No hepatic enlargement\\nSerum proteins low Serum proteins low\\nAnaemia present Anaemia present‘Flag sign’—alternate bands of light (depigmented) Monkey-like face, protuberant abdomen, thin limbs\\nand dark (pigmented) hair\\nMorphology Enlarged fatty liver No fatty liver\\nAtrophy of different tissues and organs but Atrophy of different tissues and organs including\\nsubcutaneous fat preserved subcutaneous fat246SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesThe spectrum of clinical syndromes  produced as a result\\nof PEM includes the following (Fig. 9.7):\\n1.Kwashiorkor  which is related to protein deficiency though\\ncalorie intake may be sufficient.\\n2.Marasmus  is starvation in infants occurring due to overall\\nlack of calories.\\nThe salient features of the two conditions are contrasted\\nin Table 9.3.  However, it must be remembered that mixed\\nforms of kwashiorkor-marasmus syndrome may also occur.\\nDISORDERS OF VITAMINS\\nVitamins are organic substances which cannot be synthesised\\nwithin the body and are essential for maintenance of normalstructure and function of cells.  Thus, these substances must be\\nprovided in the human diet. Most of the vitamins are of plantor animal origin so that they normally enter the body asconstituents of ingested plant food or animal food. They are\\nrequired in minute amounts in contrast to the relatively largeamounts of essential amino acids and fatty acids. Vitamins\\ndo not play any part in production of energy.\\nETIOLOGY OF VITAMIN DEFICIENCIES.  In the develop-\\ning countries, multiple deficiencies of vitamins and other\\nnutrients are common due to generalised malnutrition of\\ndietary origin. In the developed countries, individual vitamin\\ndeficiencies  are noted more often, particularly in children,\\nadolescent, pregnant and lactating women, and in some dueto poverty. General secondary causes of conditioned\\nnutritional deficiencies listed already above (i.e. interference\\nin ingestion, absorption, utilization, excretion) can result invitamin deficinecy in either case. Chronic alcoholism is a\\ncommon denominator in many of vitamin deficiencies. A few\\nother noteworthy features about vitamins are as under:1.While both vitamin deficiency and excess may occur from\\nanother disease, the states of excess and deficiencythemselves also cause disease.2.\\nVitamins in high dose can be used as drugs.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 9.4: Vitamin Deficiencies.\\nVitamins Deficiency Disorders\\nI.

Vitamins are conven-\\ntionally divided into 2 groups: fat-soluble and water-soluble.\\n1.Fat-soluble vitamins. There are 4 fat-soluble vitamins:\\nA, D, E and K. They are absorbed from intestine in the\\npresence of bile salts and intact pancreatic function. Theirdeficiencies occur more readily due to conditioning factors(secondary deficiency ). Beside the deficiency syndromes of\\nthese vitamins, a state of hypervitaminosis  due to excess of\\nvitamin A and D also occurs.\\n2.\\nWater-soluble vitamins. This group conventionally\\nconsists of vitamin C and members of B complex group.\\nBesides, choline, biotin and flavonoids are new additions tothis group. Water-soluble vitamins are more readily absor-bed from small intestine. Deficiency of these vitamins ismainly due to primary (dietary) factors.  Being water soluble,\\nthese vitamins are more easily lost due to cooking orprocessing of food.\\nTable 9.4 sums up the various clinical disorders produced\\nby vitamin deficiencies.\\nFAT-SOLUBLE  VITAMINS\\nVit\\namin A (Retinol)\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Vitamin A or retinol is a fat-soluble alcohol.\\nIt is available in diet in 2 forms:\\nAs preformed retinol,  the dietary sources of which are\\nanimal-derived foods such as yolk of eggs, butter, whole\\nmilk, fish, liver, kidney.\\nAs provitamin precursor carotenoid,  which is derived from\\nβ-carotene-containing foods such as yellow plants and\\nvegetables e.g. carrots, potatoes, pumpkins, mangoes,spinach. β-carotene can be absorbed intact or converted in\\nthe intestinal mucosa to form retinaldehyde which issubsequently reduced to retinol.\\nRetinol is stored in the liver cells and released for trans-\\nport to peripheral tissues after binding to retinol-bindingprotein found in blood.\\nThe physiologic functions  of retinol are as follows:\\n1.Maintenance of normal vision in reduced light . This invol-\\nves formation of 2 pigments by oxidation of retinol: rhodopsin ,\\na light sensitive pigment in reduced light synthesised in therod cells, and iodopsin s sensitive in bright light and formed\\nin cone cells of retina. These pigments then transform the\\nradiant energy into nerve impulses.\\n2.Maintenance of structure and function of specialised epithe-\\nlium.  Retinol plays an important role in the synthesis of\\nglycoproteins of the cell membrane of specialised epithelium\\nsuch as mucus-secreting columnar epithelium in glands and\\nmucosal surfaces, respiratory epithelium and urothelium.\\n3.Maintenance of normal cartilaginous and bone growth.\\n4. Increased immunity  against infections in children .\\n5. Anti-proliferative effect.  β-carotene has anti-oxidant\\nproperties and may cause regression of certain non-tumorous\\nskin diseases, premalignant conditions and certain cancers.\\nLESIONS IN VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY.  Nutritional defi-\\nciency of vitamin A is common in countries of South-East\\nAsia, Africa, Central and South America whereas mal-absorption syndrome may account for conditioned vitamin\\nA deficiency in developed countries.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Consequent to vitamin A\\ndeficiency, following pathologic changes are seen\\n(Fig. 9.8):\\n1.O\\ncular lesions.  Lesions in the eyes are most obvious.\\nNight blindness  is usually the first sign of vitamin A\\ndeficiency. As a result of replacement metaplasia of\\nmucus-secreting cells by squamous cells, there is dry andscaly scleral conjunctiva ( xerophthalmia ). The lacrimal duct\\nalso shows hyperkeratosis. Corneal ulcers may occurwhich may get infected and cause keratomalacia. Bitot’s spots\\nmay appear which are focal triangular areas of opacitiesdue to accumulation of keratinised epithelium. If theseoccur on cornea, they impede transmission of light.Ultimately, infection, scarring and opacities lead to\\nblindness.\\n2.Cutaneous lesions.  The skin develops papular lesions\\ngiving toad-like appearance ( xeroderma ). This is due to\\nfollicular hyperkeratosis and keratin plugging in the\\nsebaceous glands.\\n3.\\nOther lesions.  These are as under:\\ni)Squamous metaplasia of respiratory epithelium  of bronchus\\nand trachea may predispose to respiratory infections.248SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesii)Squamous metaplasia of pancreatic ductal  epithelium  may\\nlead to obstruction and cystic dilatation.\\niii)Squamous metaplasia of urothelium  of the pelvis of kid-\\nney may predispose to pyelonephritis and perhaps to\\nrenal calculi.\\niv) Long-standing metaplasia may cause progression to\\nanaplasia  under certain circumstances.\\nv) Bone growth  in vitamin A deficient animals is retarded.\\nvi) Immune dysfunction may occur due to damaged barrier\\nepithelium and compromised immune defenses.\\nvii) Pregnant women  may have increased risk of maternal\\ninfection, mortality and impaired embryonic develop-ment.\\nHYPERVITAMINOSIS A.  Very large doses of vitamin A\\ncan produce toxic manifestations in children as well as inadults. These may be acute or chronic.\\nAcute toxicity.  This results from a single large dose of vitamin\\nA. The effects include neurological manifestations resemblingbrain tumour e.g. headache, vomiting, stupor, papilloedema.\\nChronic toxicity.  The clinical manifestations of chronic\\nvitamin A excess are as under:\\ni)Neurological  such as severe headache and disordered\\nvision due to increased intracranial pressure.ii)Skeletal pains  due to loss of cortical bone by increased\\nosteoclastic activity as well as due to exostosis.iii)Cutaneous involvement  may be in the form of pruritus,\\nfissuring, sores at the corners of mouth and coarseness ofhair.iv)Hepatomegaly  with parenchymal damage and fibrosis.\\nv)Hypercarotenaemia  is yellowness of palms and skin due\\nto excessive intake of β -carotene containing foods like carrots\\nor due to inborn error of metabolism.\\nThe effects of toxicity usually disappear on stopping\\nexcess of vitamin A intake.\\nVitamin D (Calcitriol)\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  This fat-soluble vitamin exists in 2 activated\\nsterol forms:\\nVitamin D2 or calciferol;  and\\nVitamin D3 or cholecalciferol.\\nThe material originally described as vitamin D1 was\\nsubsequently found to be impure mixture of sterols. Since\\nvitamin D2 and D3 have similar metabolism and functions,\\nthey are therefore referred to as vitamin D.\\nThere are 2 main sources  of vitamin D:\\ni) Endogenous synthesis.  80% of body’s need of vitamin D\\nis met by endogenous synthesis from the action of ultravioletlight on 7-dehydrocholesterol widely distributed in oilysecretions of the skin. The vitamin so formed by irradiationenters the body directly through the skin. Pigmentation ofthe skin reduces the beneficial effects of ultraviolet light.\\nii) Exogenous sources.  The other source of vitamin D is diet\\nsuch as deep sea fish, fish oil, eggs, butter, milk, some plants\\nand grains.\\nIrrespective of the source of vitamin D, it must be conver-\\nted to its active metabolites  (25-hydroxy vitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D or calcitriol) after its metabolism  inthe liver and kidney for being functionally active (Fig. 9.9).\\n1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol) is 5-10 times more\\npotent biologically than 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Theproduction of calcitriol by the kidney is regulated by:\\nplasma levels of calcitriol (hormonal feedback);\\nplasma calcium levels (hypocalcaemia stimulates\\nsynthesis); and\\nplasma phosphorus levels (hypophosphataemia\\nstimulates synthesis).\\nThe main storage site of vitamin D is the adipose tissue\\nrather than the liver which is the case with vitamin A.\\nThe main physiologic functions  of the most active\\nmetabolite of vitamin D, calcitriol, are mediated by its bindingto nuclear receptor superfamily, vitamin D receptor,\\nexpressed on a wide variety of cells. These actions are as\\nunder:\\n1. Maintenance of normal plasma levels of calcium and\\nphosphorus.  The major essential function of vitamin D is to\\npromote mineralisation of bone. This is achieved by the\\nfollowing actions of vitamin D:\\ni)Intestinal absorption  of calcium and phosphorus is\\nstimulated by vitamin D.\\nii)On bones.  Vitamin D is normally required for minerali-\\nsation of epiphyseal cartilage and osteoid matrix. However,in hypocalcaemia, vitamin D collaborates with parathyroidhormone and causes osteoclastic resorption of calcium and\\nphosphorus from bone so as to maintain the normal blood\\nlevels of calcium and phosphorus.iii)On kidneys.  Vitamin D stimulates reabsorption of calcium\\nat distal renal tu bular level, though this function is also\\nparathyroid hormone-dependent.\\n2.\\nAntiproliferative effects.  Vitamin D receptor is expressed\\non the parathyroid gland cells by which active form of\\nvitamin D causes antiproliferative action on parathyroid cellsand suppresses the parathormone gene. Besides, vitamin Dreceptor is also expressed on cells of organs which do notFigure 9.9 Normal metabolism of vitamin D.\\n249CHAPTER 9 Environmental and Nutritional Diseaseshave any role in mineral ion homeostasis and has\\nantiproliferative effects on them e.g. in skin, breast cancercells, prostate cancer cells.\\nLESIONS IN VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY.   Deficiency of\\nvitamin D may result from:\\ni)reduced endogenous synthesis due to inadequate\\nexposure to sunlight;i\\ni) dietary deficiency of vitamin D;\\niii) malabsorption of lipids due to lack of bile salts such as inintrahepatic biliary obstruction, pancreatic insufficiency andmalabsorption syndrome;iv) derangements of vitamin D metabolism as occur inkidney disorders (chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome,uraemia), liver disorders (diffuse liver disease) and geneticdisorders; andv) resistance of end-organ to respond to vitamin D.\\nDeficiency of vitamin D from any of the above\\nmechanisms results in 3 types of lesions:1. rickets in growing children;2. osteomalacia in adults; and3. hypocalcaemic tetany due to neuromuscular dysfunction.\\nRICKETS.  The primary defects in rickets are:\\ninterference with mineralisation of bone; and\\nderanged endochondral and intramembranous bone\\ngrowth.\\nThe pathogenesis of lesions in rickets is better understood\\nby contrasting them with sequence of changes in normal bone\\ngrowth as outlined in Table 9.5.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Rickets occurs in growing\\nchildren from 6 months to 2 years of age. The disease hasthe following lesions and clinical characteristics (Fig. 9.10):\\nSkeletal changes.  These are as under:\\ni)Craniotabes  is the earliest bony lesion occurring due to\\nsmall round unossified areas in the membranous bonesof the skull, disappearing within 12 months of birth. Theskull looks square and box-like.ii) Harrison’s sulcus  appears due to indrawing of soft ribs\\non inspiration.iii) Rachitic rosary  is a deformity of chest due to cartila-\\nginous overgrowth at costochondral junction.iv) Pigeon-chest deformity  is the anterior protrusion of\\nsternum due to action of respiratory muscles.v) Bow legs  occur in ambulatory children due to weak\\nbones of lower legs.vi) Knock knees  may occur due to enlarged ends of the\\nfemur, tibia and fibula.vii) Lower epiphyses of radius may be enlarged.\\nviii) Lumbar lordosis  is due to involvement of the spine\\nand pelvis.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 9.5: Contrasting Features of Rickets with Normal Bone Growth.\\nNormal Bone Growth Rickets\\nI.

These are as follows:\\ni) Lowered levels of active metabolites of vitamin D (25-\\nhydroxy vitamin D and 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D).ii) Plasma calcium levels are normal or slightly low.iii) Plasma phosphate levels are lowered.iv) Plasma alkaline phosphatase is usually raised due toosteoblastic activity.\\nVitamin D-dependent rickets is an autosomal dominant\\ndisorder of vitamin D. The disease responds rapidly toadministration of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D.\\nOSTEOMALACIA.  Osteomalacia is the adult counterpart\\nof rickets in which there is failure of mineralisation of the\\nosteoid matrix. It may occur following dietary deficiency,poor endogenous synthesis of vitamin D, or as a result ofconditioned deficiency.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Due to deficiency of\\nvitamin D, osteoid matrix laid down fails to get minera-lised. In H and E stained microscopic sections, this isidentified by widened and thickened osteoid seams(stained pink) and decreased mineralisation at the bordersbetween osteoid and bone (stained basophilic).  von Kossa’s\\nstain  for calcium may be employed to mark out the wide\\nseams of unstained osteoid while the calcified bone isstained black. In addition, there may be increasedosteoclastic activity and fibrosis of marrow.\\nClinical features.  Osteomalacia is characterised by:\\ni)muscular weakness;\\ni\\ni) vague bony pains;\\niii) fractures following trivial trauma;iv) incomplete or greenstick fractures; andv) looser’s zones or pseudofractures at weak places in bones.\\nBiochemical changes.  These are:\\ni) normal or low serum calcium levels;\\nii) plasma phosphate levels lowered; andiii)raised serum alkaline phosphatase due to increased\\nosteoblastic activity.\\nIt may be worthwhile to note here that another chronic\\ndisorder of skeleton seen in elderly, osteoporosis,  is clinically\\nsimilar but biochemically different disease (Chapter 28).\\nHYPERVITAMINOSIS D.  Very large excess of vitamin D\\nmay cause increased intestinal absorption of calcium and\\nphosphorus, leading to hypercalcaemia, hyperphos-phataemia and increased bone resorption. These changesmay result in the following effects:\\ni)increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate;\\ni\\ni) predisposition to renal calculi;\\niii) osteoporosis; andiv) widespread metastatic calcification, more marked in the\\nrenal tubules, arteries, myocardium, lungs and stomach.\\nVitamin E ( α αα αα-Tocopherol)\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Out of many naturally-occurring tocoferols\\nand tocotrienols, α-tocopherol is biologically the most active\\nfat soluble compound for humans. Vitamin E is found in most\\nof the ordinary foods such as vegetables, grains, nuts andoils. It is absorbed from the intestine and transported in bloodin the form of chylomicrons. It is stored in fat depots, liverand muscle.\\nThe main physiologic functions  of vitamin E are as\\nunder:1. Anti-oxidant activity.  Active form of Vitamin E acts as an\\nantioxidant and prevents the oxidative degradation of cellmembranes containing phospholipids.2. Scavenger of free radicals.  Vitamin E scavenges free radicals\\nformed by redox reaction in the body (Chapter 3) and thusmaintains the integrity of the cell.3.  Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.4. Activates protein kinase C and phospholipase A\\n2.\\nLESIONS IN VITAMIN E DEFICIENCY.  The deficiency of\\nvitamin E is mainly by conditioning disorders affecting itsabsorption and transport such as abetalipoproteinaemia,intra- and extrahepatic biliary cholestasis, cystic fibrosis ofthe pancreas and malabsorption syndrome. Low birth weightneonates, due to physiologic immaturity of the liver andbowel, may also develop vitamin E deficiency. Lesions ofvitamin E deficiency are as follows:1.Neurons  with long axons develop degeneration in the\\nposterior columns of spinal cord.2.Peripheral nerves  may also develop myelin degeneration\\nin the axons.3.Skeletal muscles  may develop denervation.\\n4.Retinal pigmentary degeneration  may occur.\\n5.Red blood cells  deficient in vitamin E such as in premature\\ninfants have reduced lifespan.6.In experimental animals, vitamin E deficiency can pro-\\nduce sterility  in both male and female animals.\\nVi\\ntamin K\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Vitamin K ( K for Koagulations in Danish )\\nexists in nature in 2 forms:\\nVitamin K1 or phylloquinone,  obtained from exogenous\\ndietary sources such as most green leafy vegetables; and\\nVitamin K2 or menaquinone,  produced endogenously by\\nnormal intestinal flora.  Phylloquinone can be converted into\\nmenaquinone in some organs.\\nLike other fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin K is absorbed\\nfrom the small intestine and requires adequate bile flow andintact pancreatic function.\\nThe main physiologic function  of vitamin K is in hepa-\\ntic microsomal carboxylation reaction for vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (most importantly factor II orprothrombin; others are factors VII, IX and X).\\nLESIONS IN VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY.  Since vitamin K\\nis necessary for the manufacture of prothrombin, its\\ndeficiency leads of hypoprothrombinaemia (Chapter 13).\\nEstimation of plasma prothrombin, thus, affords a simple in\\nvitro test for determining whether there is deficiency of\\nvitamin K. Subjects with levels below 70% of normal shouldreceive therapy with vitamin K.\\nBecause most of the green vegetables contain vitamin K\\nand that it can be synthesised endogenously, vitamin Kdeficiency is frequently a conditioned deficiency. Theconditions which may bring about vitamin K deficiency areas follows:251CHAPTER 9 Environmental and Nutritional Diseases1. Haemorrhagic disease of newborn. The newborn infants\\nare deficient in vitamin K because of minimal stores ofvitamin K at birth, lack of established intestinal flora forendogenous synthesis and limited dietary intake since breastmilk is a poor source of vitamin K. Hence the clinical practiceis to routinely administer vitamin K at birth.\\n2. Biliary obstruction.  Bile is prevented from entering the\\nbowel due to biliary obstruction which prevents the\\nabsorption of this fat-soluble vitamin. Surgery in patients ofobstructive jaundice, therefore, leads to marked tendency tobleeding.\\n3. Due to malabsorption syndrome.  Patients suffering from\\nmalabsorption of fat develop vitamin K deficiency e.g. coeliac\\ndisease, sprue, pancreatic disease, hypermotility of boweletc.\\n4. Due to anticoagulant therapy.  Patients on warfarin group\\nof anticoagulants have impaired biosynthesis of vitamin K-\\ndependent coagulation factors.\\n5. Due to antibiotic therapy.  The use of broad-spectrum\\nantibiotics and sulfa drugs reduces the normal intestinal flora.6. Diffuse liver disease.  Patients with diffuse liver disease\\n(e.g. cirrhosis, amyloidosis of liver, hepatocellular carcinoma,\\nhepatoblastoma) have hypoprothrombinaemia due toimpaired synthesis of prothrombin. Administration ofvitamin K to such patients is of no avail since liver, whereprothrombin synthesis utilising vitamin K takes place, isdiseased.\\nWATER-SOLUBLE  VITAMINS\\nVit\\namin C (Ascorbic Acid)\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Vitamin C exists in natural sources as L-\\nascorbic acid closely related to glucose. The major sources of\\nvitamin C are citrus fruits such as orange, lemon, grape fruitand some fresh vegetables like tomatoes and potatoes. It ispresent in small amounts in meat and milk. The vitamin iseasily destroyed by heating so that boiled or pasteurised milkmay lack vitamin C. It is readily absorbed from the smallintestine and is stored in many tissues, most abundantly inadrenal cortex.\\nThe physiologic functions  of vitamin C are due to its\\nability to carry out oxidation-reduction reactions:\\nL-Ascorbic Acid  Dehydro L-Ascorbic\\nacid + 2H\\n+ + 2e\\n1. Vitamin C has been fond to have antioxidant  properties\\nand can scavenge free radicals.2. Ascorbic acid is required for hydroxylation of proline toform hydroxyproline which is an essential component ofcollagen.\\n3. Besides collagen, it is necessary for the ground substance\\nof other mesenchymal structures such as osteoid, chondroitin\\nsulfate, dentin and cement substance of vascularendothelium.\\n4. Vitamin C being a reducing substance  has other functions\\nsuch as:\\nhydroxylation of dopamine to norepinephrine;maintenance of folic acid levels by preventing oxidation\\nof tetrahydrofolate; and\\nrole in iron metabolism in its absorption, storage and\\nkeeping it in reduced state.\\nLESIONS IN VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY.  Vitamin C defi-\\nciency in the food or as a conditioned deficiency results in\\nscurvy. The lesions and clinical manifestations of scurvy areseen more commonly at two peak ages: in early childhoodand in the very aged. These are as under (Fig. 9.11):\\n1. Haemorrhagic diathesis. A marked tendency to bleeding\\nis characteristic of scurvy. This may be due to deficiency of\\nintercellular cement which holds together the cells of\\ncapillary endothelium. There may be haemorrhages in the\\nskin, mucous membranes, gums, muscles, joints and\\nunderneath the periosteum.\\n2.Skeletal lesions.  These changes are more pronounced in\\ngrowing children. The most prominent change is the deranged\\nformation of osteoid matrix and not deranged mineralisation  (c.f.\\nthe pathological changes underlying rickets already\\ndescribed). Growing tubular bones as well as flat bones are\\naffected. The epiphyseal ends of growing long bones have\\ncartilage cells in rows which normally undergo provisional\\nmineralisation. However, due to vitamin C deficiency, the\\nnext step of laying down of osteoid matrix by osteoblasts is\\npoor and results in failure of resorption of cartilage. Conse-\\nquently, mineralised cartilage under the widened and irregu-\\nlar epiphyseal plates project as scorbutic rosary.  The skeletal\\nchanges are further worsened due to haemorrhages andhaematomas under the periosteum and bleeding into the joint\\nspaces.\\n3.Delayed wound healing.  There is delayed healing of\\nwounds in scurvy due to following:\\nderanged collagen synthesis;\\nFigure 9.11 Lesions in scurvy.252SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquespoor preservation and maturation of fibroblasts; and\\nlocalisation of infections in the wounds.\\n4. Anaemia. Anaemia is common in scurvy. It may be the\\nresult of haemorrhage, interference with formation of folic\\nacid or deranged iron metabolism. Accordingly, anaemia ismost often normocytic normochromic type; occasionally itmay be megaloblastic or even iron deficiency type.\\n5. Lesions in teeth and gums.  Scurvy may interfere with\\ndevelopment of dentin. The gums are soft and swollen, may\\nbleed readily and get infected commonly.\\n6. Skin rash.  Hyperkeratotic and follicular rash may occur\\nin scurvy.\\nVITAMIN B COMPLEX\\nThe term vitamin B was originally coined for a substance\\ncapable of curing beriberi (B from beriberi). Now, vitamin Bcomplex is commonly used for a group of essential compounds\\nwhich are biochemically unrelated but occur together in certainfoods  such as green leafy vegetables, cereals, yeast, liver and\\nmilk. Most of the vitamins in this group are involved inmetabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.\\nThe principal members of vitamin B complex are thiamine\\n(vitamin B\\n1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin/nicotinic acid\\n(vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine\\n(vitamin B6), folate (folic acid), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12)\\nand biotin. There is no definite evidence that any clinicaldisorder results from deficiency of pantothenic acid (vitaminB\\n5).\\nThiamine (Vitamin B1)\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Thiamine was the first in the family of\\nvitamin B complex group and hence named B1. Thiamine\\nhydrochloride is available in a variety of items of diet such\\nas peas, beans, pulses, yeast, green vegetable roots, fruits,\\nmeat, pork, rice and wheat bran. The vitamin is lost in refined\\nfoods such as polished rice, white flour and white sugar. Afew substances in the diet (strong tea, coffee) act as anti-\\nthiamines.  Since the vitamin is soluble in water, considerable\\namount of the vitamin is lost during cooking of vegetables.\\nThe vitamin is absorbed from the intestine either by passive\\ndiffusion or by energy-dependent transport. Reserves of\\nvitamin B\\n1 are stored in the skeletal muscles, heart, liver,\\nkidneys and bones.\\nThe main physiologic function  of thiamine is in\\ncarbohydrate metabolism. Thiamine after absorption isphosphorylated to form thiamine pyrophosphate which is\\nthe functionally active compound. This compound acts as\\ncoenzyme for carboxylase so as to decarboxylate pyruvicacid, synthesises ATP and also participates in the synthesis\\nof fat from carbohydrate. In addition, thiamin plays a role in\\nperipheral nerve conduction by an unknown mechanism.\\nLESIONS IN THIAMINE DEFICIENCY.  Thiamine\\ndeficiency can occur from primary or conditioned causes,\\nchronic alcoholism being an important cause. The deficiencystate leads to failure of complete combustion of carbohydrate\\nand accumulation of pyruvic acid. This results in beriberi\\nwhich produces lesions at 3 target tissues (peripheral nerves,\\nheart and brain). Accor dingly, beriberi is of 3 types:dry beriberi ( peripheral neuritis );\\nwet beriberi ( cardiac manifestations ), and\\ncerebral beriberi ( Wernicke-Korsakoff’s syndrome ).\\nIt is worth-noting that lesions in beriberi are mainly\\nlocated in the nervous system and heart. This is because theenergy requirement of the brain and nerves is solely derivedfrom oxidation of carbohydrates which is deranged inberiberi, while lesions in the heart appear to arise due toreduced ATP synthesis in beriberi which is required forcardiac functions.\\nThe features of 3 forms of beriberi are as under:\\n1. Dry beriberi (peripheral neuritis).  This is marked by\\nneuromuscular symptoms such as weakness, paraesthesiaand sensory loss. The nerves show polyneuritis, myelindegeneration and fragmentation of axons.\\n2. Wet beriberi (cardiac manifestations).  This is charac-\\nterised by cardiovascular involvement, generalised oedema,\\nserous effusions and chronic passive congestion of viscera.The heart in beriberi is flabby (due to thin and weakmyocardium), enlarged and globular in appearance due to4-chamber dilatation (Fig. 9.12).\\nMicroscopic examination  of the heart shows hydropic\\ndegeneration of myocardial fibres, loss of striations,interstitial oedema and lymphocytic infiltration.\\n3. Cerebral beriberi (Wernicke-Korsakoff’s syndrome).It consists of the following features:\\ni)Wernicke’s encephalopathy  occurs more often due to\\nconditioned deficiencies such as in chronic alcoholism. It is\\ncharacterised by degeneration of ganglia cells, focaldemyelination and haemorrhage in the nuclei surroundingthe region of ventricles and aqueduct.\\nMicroscopic examination shows degeneration andnecrosis of neurons, hypertrophy-hyperplasia of smallblood vessels and haemorrhages.\\nii)Korsakoff’s psychosis  results from persistence of psychotic\\nfeatures following brain haemorrhage in Wernicke’sencephalopathy.\\nFigure 9.12 Wet (Cardiac) beriberi. Flabby, thin-walled, enlarged\\nand globular appearance of the heart due to four-chamber dilatation.253CHAPTER 9 Environmental and Nutritional DiseasesRiboflavin (Vitamin B2)\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Riboflavin used to be called ‘yellow\\nrespiratory enzyme’ ( flavus  = yellow), now known as\\n‘cytochrome oxidase enzyme’ which is important in view of\\nits role as cellular respiratory coenzyme. The vitamin isusually distributed in plant and animal foods such as theliver, beaf, mutton, pork, eggs, milk and green vegetables.Like other water-soluble vitamins, it is rapidly absorbed fromthe bowel and stored in tissues like liver.\\nLESIONS IN RIBOFLAVIN DEFICIENCY.  Lesions due to\\nprimary or conditioned deficiency of riboflavin ( aribo-\\nflavinosis ) are as follows:\\n1.Ocular lesions  consist of vascularisation of normally\\navascular cornea due to proliferation of capillaries from\\nlimbus. Subsequently, conjunctivitis, interstitial keratitis andcorneal ulcers may develop.2.Cheilosis  and  angular stomatitis  are characterised by\\noccurrence of fissures and cracks at the angles of mouth.3.Glossitis  is development of red, cyanosed and shiny\\ntongue due to atrophy of mucosa of tongue ( ‘bald tongue’ ).\\n4Skin changes  appear in the form of scaly dermatitis\\nresembling seborrheic dermatitis on nasolabial folds on theface, scrotum and vulva.5. Anaemia may develop in some cases.\\nNiacin/Nicotinic Acid (Vitamin B\\n3)\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  As with thiamine and riboflavin, niacin or\\nnicotinic acid or vitamin B3 is also widely distributed in plant\\nand animal foods such as the liver, kidney, meat, greenvegetables and whole grain cereals. Niacin includesbiologically active derivative nicotinamide  which is essential\\nfor the formation of 2 oxidative coenzymes ( dehydrogenases ):\\nNAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) which is requi-\\nred for dehydrogenation in the metabolism of fat, carbo-hydrates and proteins.\\nNADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)\\nwhich is essential for dehydrogenation in the hexosemonophosphate shunt of glucose metabolism.\\nLESIONS IN NIACIN DEFICIENCY.  Deficiency of niacin\\ncauses pellagra, so named because of the rough skin of such\\npatients (Italian pelle agra  = rough skin). Pellagra may result\\nfrom dietary deficiency in those who largely subsist on maizesince niacin in maize is present in bound form and hence notabsorbable. Since niacin can be endogenously synthesisedfrom tryptophan, a diet deficient in this amino acid ordisorders of tryptophan metabolism such as in carcinoidsyndrome or Hartnup syndrome results in niacin deficiency.\\nLesions  in pellagra are characterised by 3Ds:\\n1Dermatitis:  The sun-exposed areas of skin develop\\nerythema resembling sunburn. This may progress to chronictype of dermatitis with blister formation.2.Diarrhoea:  Lesions similar to those seen in skin may\\ndevelop in mucous membrane of the alimentary tract resul-ting in glossitis, lesions in the mouth, oesophagus, stomachand colon and cause diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting andburning sensation.3.Dementia:  Degeneration of neurons of the brain and of\\nspinal tract results in neurological symptoms such asdementia, peripheral neuritis, ataxia and visual and auditorydisturbances.\\nTOXICITY OF NIACIN.  Toxicity due to administration of\\nhigh doses of niacin as therapy for dyslipidaemia has been\\nobserved but not due dietary excess. It is characterised byflushing of skin and liver derangement.\\nPyridoxine (Vitamin B\\n6)\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Pyridoxine or vitamin B6 is widely\\ndistributed in all animal and plant foods such as meat, liver,\\neggs, green vegetables and whole grain cereals. Pyridoxineexists in 3 closely related naturally-occurring substances—pyridoxine, pyridoxal  and pyridoxamine. All of these can be\\nconverted into biologically active coenzyme, pyridoxal 5-phosphate.\\nThe major physiologic functions  of pyridoxine are\\nrelated to:\\nfat metabolism;\\nprotein metabolism;\\namino acid metabolism such as decarboxylation of amino\\nacids, transmethylation of methionine, conversion of trypto-phan to niacin;\\nsteroid metabolism;\\nneurotransmitter synthesis; and\\nhaem synthesis.\\nLESIONS IN PYRIDOXINE DEFICIENCY.  Vitamin B6\\ndeficiency may result from inadequate dietary intake or mayresult from secondary deficiency such as increased demandin pregnancy and lactation, chronic alcoholism and intakeof certain drugs (e.g. isoniazid in the treatment oftuberculosis, penicillamine, oestrogen in oral contraceptivesetc).\\nThe lesions  of pyridoxine deficiency include the\\nfollowing:\\n1. Convulsions in infants born to mothers who had been\\nadministered large doses of vitamin B\\n6 for hyperemesis\\ngravidarum (pyridoxine dependence)\\n2. Dermatitis and seborrhoea\\n3. Cheilosis and angular stomatitis4. Glossitis (bald tongue)\\n5. Neuropathy\\n6. Depression, confusion7. Sideroblastic anaemia.\\nFolate (Folic Acid) and Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B\\n12)\\nBoth these vitamins included in the B complex group are\\nrequired for red cell formation. Their deficiency leads to\\nmegaloblastic anaemia which is discussed in Chapter 12.\\nBiotin\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin and a\\nmember of vitamin B complex group. It is available in food\\nsources such as organ meat, soya beans, egg yolk; however254SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesegg-white has a protein avidin which binds to biotin and\\nblocks its bioavailability.\\nThe major physiologic functions  of biotin are as under:\\n1. In gene expression2. In gluconeogenesis\\n3. In fatty acid synthesis\\n4. In catabolism of certain amino acids such as leucine\\n4. As carrier of CO\\n2 in carboxylase enzymes.\\nLESIONS IN BIOTIN DEFICIENCY.  Biotin deficiency is\\nrare and develops due to inborn errors of metabolism and in\\npatients on parenteral nutrients devoid of biotin. The lesions\\nof biotin deficiency are as under:\\n1.Mental and neurologic symptoms such as hallucination,\\ndepression, paraesthesia2. Anorexia\\n3.\\nNausea\\n4. Scaly, seborrhoeic dermatitis\\n5. In infants, hypotonia, alopecia and rash near ears.\\nIn concluding the discussion of vitamin B complex, it\\nmust be mentioned that many of the animal and plant foods\\ncontain vitamin B complex group of vitamins. Their\\ndeficiency, whether primary from poverty, ignorance etc, or\\nsecondary from conditioning factors like chronic alcoholism,\\nis more frequently  multiple vitamin deficiency.  Hence, the\\nclinical practice is to administer combination of thesemembers of vitamin B complex.\\nCHOLINE\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Choline is precursor form of acetylcoline and\\nbetaine. Choline is widely distributed as lecithin in foods such\\nas egg yolk, milk, wheat and organ meat.  Choline is also\\nsynthesised in the liver.\\nThe major physiologic functions  of choline are as under:\\n1.In maintenance structural integrity of cell membranes\\n2.In transmembrane signaling pathways\\n3.\\nIn cholinergic neurotransmission\\n4. In metabolism of lipids and cholesterol.\\nLESIONS IN CHOLINE DEFICIENCY.  Choline deficiency\\ndevelops in patients on choline-free parenteral nutrients. The\\nlesions of choline deficiency are as under:\\n1.Fatty liver with deranged liver enzymes\\n2.Skeletal muscle damage with elevated CPK levels.\\nFLA\\nVONOIDS\\nPHYSIOLOGY.  Flavoonoids are a form of polyphenols\\npresent in several fruits and vegetables and are the\\nconstituents which imparts colour, flavour and taste to these\\nedible products. Particular food and vegetables rich in\\nflavonoids are berries, grapes, apples, broccoli, onions,legumes etc.\\nThe major physiologic functions  of flavonoids are as\\nunder:\\n1.As antioxidants\\n2.In cell signaling pathwaysLESIONS IN BIOTIN DEFICIENCY.  Flavonoids have been\\na recent addition to the family of vitamins. Present data onanimal experiments and human clinical studies indicates that\\nthey play a role in prevention of neurodegenerative diseases,osteoporosis and diabetes.\\nMETALS AND TRACE ELEMENTS\\nSeveral minerals in trace amounts are essential for health\\nsince they form components of enzymes and cofactors formetabolic functions. Besides calcium  and phosphorus  required\\nfor vitamin D manufacture, others include: iron, copper, iodine,\\nzinc, selenium, manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum,fluorine.  However, out of these, the dietary deficiency of first\\nfive trace elements is associated with deficiency states whichare discussed in detail in respective chapters later. These areas under:\\ni)Iron:  Microcytic hypochromic anaemia.\\nii)Calcium:  reduced bone mass, osteoporosis.\\niii)Phosphorous : Rickets, osteomalacia.\\niv)Copper:  Muscle weakness, neurologic defect, anaemia,\\ngrowth retardation.v)Iodine:  Goitre and hyperthyroidism, cretinism.\\nvi)Zinc:  Growth retardation, infertility, alopecia.\\nvii) Selenium:  Cardiomyopathy, muscle degeneration.\\nviii) Fluoride:  Dental caries.\\nix) Manganese : Impaired growth and skeletal development.\\nx)Molybdenum : Severe neurological abnormalities.\\nDIET AND CANCER\\nBefore closing the discussion of nutritional pathology, it is\\nworthwhile to sum up relationship of these factors tocarcinogenesis discussed in previoius chapter. There are threepossible mechanisms on which the story of this relationshipcan be built up:\\n1. Dietary content of exogenous carcinogens:\\ni) The most important example in this mechanism comes\\nfrom naturally-occurring carcinogen aflatoxin  which is\\nstrongly associated with high incidence of hepatocellularcarcinoma in those consuming grain contaminated withmould,  Aspergillus  flavus .\\nii)Artificial sweeteners  (e.g. saccharine cyclomates), food\\nadditives and pesticide contamination of food are implicatedas carcinogens derived from diet.\\n2. Endogenous synthesis of carcinogens or promoters:\\ni) In the context of etiology of gastric carcinoma,  nitrites,\\nnitrates and amines from the digested food are trans-\\nformed in the body to carcinogens—nitrosamines andnitrosamides.ii)\\nIn the etiology of colon cancer,  low fibre intake and high\\nanimal-derived fats are implicated. High fat diet results inrise in the level of bile acids and their intermediatemetabolites produced by intestinal bacteria which act as255CHAPTER 9 Environmental and Nutritional Diseasescarcinogens. The low fibre diet, on the other hand, does not\\nprovide adequate protection to the mucosa and reduces thestool bulk and thus increases the time the stools remain inthe colon.\\niii) In the etiology of breast cancer,  epidemiologic studies have\\nimplicated the role of animal proteins, fats and obesity with\\nas yet unsubstantiated evidence.3. Inadequate protective factors:\\nAs already mentioned, some components of diet such as\\nvitamin C, A, E, selenium,  and \\nβ-carotenes  have protective role\\nagainst cancer. These substances in normal amounts in thebody act as antioxidants and protect the cells against free\\nradical injury but their role of supplementation in diet as\\nprevention against cancer is unproven.\\nq256SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesThis chapter deals with the group of disorders affecting the\\nfoetus during intrauterine life (genetic as well asdevelopmental) and paediatric age group. In the westerncountries, developmental and genetic birth defects constituteabout 50% of total mortality in infancy and childhood, whilein the developing and underdeveloped countries 95% ofinfant mortality is attributed to environmental factors suchas poor sanitation and undernutrition.\\nFor the purpose of convenience of discussion, genetic and\\npaediatric diseases are covered under the following headings:1Developmental defects:  Errors in morphogenesis\\n2.Cytogenetic (Karyotypic) defects:  chromosomal abnor-\\nmalities3.Single-gene defects:  Mendelian disorders\\n4.Multifactorial inheritance disorders\\n5.Other paediatric diseasesThough many of diseases included in the groups above\\nhave been discussed along with relevant chapters later, broadoverview of these disorders is presented below.\\nDEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS\\nDevelopmental defects are a group of abnormalities duringfoetal life due to errors in morphogenesis. The branch ofscience dealing with the study of developmental anomaliesis called teratology . Certain chemicals, drugs, physical and\\nbiologic agents are known to induce such birth defects andare called teratogens.  The morphologic abnormality or defect\\nin an organ or anatomic region of the body so produced iscalled malformation.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe teratogens may result in one of the following outcomes:\\ni)Intrauterine death\\nii\\n) Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)\\niii) Functional defectsiv) Malformation\\nThe effects  of teratogens in inducing developmental\\ndefects are related to the following factors:\\nVariable individual susceptibility to teratogen:  All patients\\nexposed to the same teratogen do not develop birth defect.\\nIntrauterine stage at which patient is exposed to teratogen:\\nMost teratogens induce birth defects during the first trimesterof pregnancy.\\nDose of teratogen:  Higher the exposure dose of teratogen,\\ngreater the chances of inducing birth defects.\\nSpecificity of developmental defect for specific teratogen:  A\\nparticular teratogen acts in a particular way and induces thesame specific developmental defect.\\nChapter 10Genetic and\\nPaediatric DiseasesChapter 10\\nClassification\\nVarious developmental anomalies resulting from teratogenic\\neffects are categorised as under:\\nAgenesis  means the complete absence of an organ e.g.\\nunilateral or bilateral agenesis of kidney.\\nAplasia  is the absence of development of an organ with\\npresence of rudiment or anlage e.g. aplasia of lung with\\nrudimentary bronchus.\\nHypoplasia  is incomplete development of an organ not\\nreaching the normal adult size e.g. microglossia.\\nAtresia  refers to incomplete formation of lumen in hollow\\nviscus e.g. oesophageal atresia.\\nDevelopmental dysplasia  is defective development of cells\\nand tissues resulting in abnormal or primitive histogenetic\\nstructures e.g. renal dysplasia ( Developmental dysplasia  is quite\\ndifferent from cellular dysplasia in relation to precancerous\\nlesions discussed earlier on page 58).\\nDystraphic anomalies  are the defects resulting from failure\\nof fusion e.g. spina bifida.\\nEctopia or heterotopia  refers to abnormal location of tissue\\nat ectopic site e.g. pancreatic heterotopia in the wall of\\nstomach.\\nExamples of Developmental Defects\\nA few common clinically important examples are given\\nbelow:\\n1.Anencephaly-spina bifida complex.  This is the group of\\nanomalies resulting from failure to fuse (dystraphy). While\\nanencephaly results from failure of neural tube closure, spinabifida occurs from incomplete closure of the spinal cord andvertebral column, often in the lumbar region. The latterresults in meningocele or meningomyelocele.\\n2.Thalidomide malformations.  Thalidomide is the best\\nknown example of teratogenic drug which was used as a\\nsedative by pregnant women in 1960s in England andGermany and resulted in high incidence of limb-reductionanomalies (phocomelia) in the newborns.\\n3.\\nFoetal hydantoin syndrome.  Babies born to mothers on\\nanti-epileptic treatment with hydantoin have characteristic\\nfacial features and congenital heart defects.\\n4. Foetal alcohol syndrome.  Ethanol is another potent\\nteratogen. Consumption of alcohol by pregnant mother in\\nfirst trimester increases the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths,growth retardation and mental retardation in the newborn.\\n5. TORCH complex.  Infection with TORCH group of\\norganisms ( Toxoplasma, Others, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus,257CHAPTER 10 Genetic and Paediatric Diseasesand Herpes simplex) during pregnancy is associated with\\nmultisystem anomalies and TORCH syndrome in the\\nnewborn (page 191).\\n6. Congenital syphilis.  As discussed in Chapter 6, vertical\\ntransmission of syphilis from mother to foetus is\\ncharacterised by Hutchinson’s triad: interstitial keratitis,sensorineural deafness and deformed Hutchinson’s teeth,along with saddle-nose deformity.\\nCYTOGENETIC (KARYOTYPIC)\\nABNORMALITIES\\nHuman germ cells (ova and sperms) contain 23 chromo-somes (haploid or 1N) while all the nucleated somatic cellsof the human body contain 23 pairs of chromosomes(diploid or 2N)—44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes,being XX in females (46, XX) and XY in males (46, XY). Thebranch of science dealing with the study of humanchromosomal abnormalities is called cytogenetics(discussed in Chapter 2).\\nIn a female, one of the two X chromosomes (paternal or\\nmaternal derived) is inactivated during embryogenesis asstated in Lyon hypothesis . This inactivation is passed to all\\nthe somatic cells while the germ cells in the female remainunaffected i.e. ovary will always have active X chromosome.Such an inactive X chromosome in the somatic cells in femaleslies condensed in the nucleus and is called as sex chromatin\\nseen specifically in the somatic cells in females. Nuclear sexing\\ncan be done for genetic female testing by preparing andstaining the smears of squamous cells scraped from oralcavity, or by identifying the Barr body  in the circulating\\nneutrophils as drumstick appendage attached to one of thenuclear lobes (Fig. 10.1).  A minimum of 30% cells positive\\nfor sex chromatin is indicative of genetically femalecomposition.\\nThough chromosomes can be studied in any human\\nnucle ated cells, circulating lymphocytes are more often used\\nfor this purpose. The study is done by arresting the dividing\\ncells in metaphase by colchicine and then spreading themon glass slide and staining them with Giemsa stain.\\nKaryotype  is the photographic representation of the\\nstained preparation of chromosomes.\\nEach chromosome is composed of a pair of identical\\ndouble helix of chromosomal DNA called chromatids.  The\\nchromosomes are classified based on their length and locationof the centromere;  centromere is the point where the two\\nchromatids cross each other (Fig. 10.2).  The distal end of each\\nchromosome is called telomere.\\nBased on centromeric location, they are classified into 3\\ngroups:\\nMetacentric chromosomes  (numbers 1, 3, 16, 19, 20) are those\\nin which the centromere is exactly in the middle.\\nSubmetacentric chromosomes  (numbers 1, 3) in which the\\ncentromere divides the chromosomes into short arm ( p arm;\\npetit means short in French) and long arm (q  arm; for alphabet\\nnext to p).\\nAcrocentric chromosomes  (numbers 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, and\\nY) have very short arm and the centromere is eccentricallylocated.Based on length of chromosomes, they are divided into 7\\ngroups—A to G, called Denver  classification  adopted at a\\nmeeting in Denver, Colorado in US.\\nChromosomal banding techniques  are employed for study\\nof classes of chromosomes. Chromosomal bands are unique\\nalternate dark and light staining patterns. Banding techniques\\ninclude:i) G-banding (Giemsa stain);ii) Q-banding (quinacrine fluorescence stain);iii) R-banding (reverse Giemsa staining); andiv) C-banding (constitutive heterochromatin demonstration).\\nWith these brief introductory comments, we can now turn\\nto abnormalities of chromosomes which can be divided into2 types:1. Numerical abnormalities; and\\n2. Structural abnormalities.\\nNumerical Abnormalities\\nAs mentioned above, normal karyotype of a human\\nnucleated somatic cell is diploid or 2N (46 chromosomes)Figure 10.1 Nuclear sexing. A, sex chromatin as seen in scraped\\nsquamous cells from oral cavity. B, Barr body seen as drumstick\\nappendage attached to a lobe of a circulating neutrophil.\\nFigure 10.2 Classification of chromosomes based on size and\\nlocation of centromere.\\n258SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniqueswhile the germ cells have haploid or 1N (23 chromo-\\nsomes).\\n1. Polyploidy  is the term used for the number of chromo-\\nsomes which is a multiple of haploid number e.g. triploid or\\n3N (69 chromosomes), tetraploid or 4N (92 chromosomes).\\nPolyploidy occurs normally in megakaryocytes and dividingliver cells. Polyploidy in somatic cells of conceptus resultsin spontaneous abortions.\\n2. Aneuploidy  is the number of chromosomes which is not\\nan exact multiple of haploid number e.g. hypodiploid or\\n2N-1 (45 chromosomes) monosomy, hyperdiploid or 2 N+1(47 chromosomes) trisomy.\\nThe most common mechanism of aneuploidy is\\nnondisjunction.  Nondisjunction is the failure of chromo-\\nsomes to separate normally during cell division during firstor second stage of meiosis, or in mitosis.\\nNondisjunction during first meiotic division  stage will result\\nin two gametes from both the parental chromosomes due tofailure to separate while the other two gametes will have nochromosomes (nullisomic).\\nNondisjunction during second meiotic division  stage results\\nin one gamete with two identical copies of the samechromosome, one nullisomic gamete, and two gametes withnormal chromosome number.\\nNondisjunction during mitosis  results in mosaicism,\\nmeaning thereby that the individual has two or more typesof cell lines derived from the same zygote. Mosaicism ofmitotic nondisjunction of chromosomes occurs in cancers.\\nAnaphase lag  is a form of nondisjunction involving single\\npair of chromosomes in which one chromosome in meiosisor a chromatid in mitosis fails to reach the pole of dividingcell at the same time (i.e. it lags behind) and is left out of thenucleus of daughter cell. This results in one normal daughtercell and the other monosomic for the missing chromosome.Three clinically important syndromes resulting from\\nnumerical aberrations of chromosomes due to nondisjunctionare as under and their main clinical features are illustratedin Fig. 10.3:\\nDown’s syndrome.  There is trisomy 21 in about 95% cases\\nof Down’s syndrome due to nondisjunction during meiosisin one of the parents. Down’s syndrome is the most commonchromosomal disorder and is the commonest cause of mentalretardation. The incidence of producing offspring withDown’s syndrome rises in mothers over 35 years of age.\\nKlinefelter’s syndrome.  Klinefelter’s syndrome is the\\nmost important example of sex chromosome trisomy. About80% cases have 47, XXY karyotype while others are mosaics.Typically, these patients have testicular dysgenesis. Ingeneral, sex chromosome trisomies are more common thantrisomies of autosomes.\\nTurner’s syndrome.  Turner’s syndrome is an example\\nof monosomy (45, X0) most often due to loss of Xchromosome in paternal meiosis.\\nStructural Abnormalities\\nDuring cell division (meiosis as well as mitosis), certain\\nstructural abnormalities of chromosomes may appear. Thesemay occur during gametogenesis and then transmitted toall somatic cells and cause hereditary transmissible disorders,or may produce somatic cell mutations and result in changesvarying from no effect to some forms of cancers. Structuralabnormalities may be balanced or unbalanced.\\nBalanced structural alteration means  no change in total\\nnumber of genes or genetic material.\\nUnbalanced structural alteration  refers to gene rearrange-\\nment resulting in loss or gain of genetic material.\\nSome common forms of structural abnormalities are as\\nunder (Fig. 10.4):\\nFigure 10.3 Clinical features of important forms of numerical chromosomal abnormalities.\\n259CHAPTER 10 Genetic and Paediatric Diseases\\nTRANSLOCATIONS. Translocation means crossing over or\\nexchange of fragment of chromosome which may occur\\nbetween non-homologous or homologous chromosomes.There are two main types of translocations: reciprocal in\\nabout two-third and Robertsonian in one-third cases:\\nReciprocal translocation  is the exchange of genetic\\nmaterial between two non-homologous (heterologous)chromosomes without involving centromere (acentric). Such\\ntranslocations occur due to single breaks in both thechromosomes and the exchange is detected by banding\\ntechniques. Reciprocal translocation may be balanced\\n(without any loss of genetic material during the exchange)\\nor unbalanced (with some loss of genetic material).\\ni)Balanced reciprocal translocation  is more common and the\\nindividual is phenotypically normal e.g. translocation\\nbetween long arm (q) of chromosomes 22 and long arm (q)\\nof chromosome 9 written as 46, XX, t (9;22). This translocation\\nis termed Philadelphia chromosome seen in most cases of\\nchronic myeloid leukaemia (page 355).\\nii)Unbalanced reciprocal translocations  are less common and\\naccount for repeated abortions and malformed children.\\nRobertsonian translocation  is less common than reci-\\nprocal translocation. In this, there is fusion of two acrocentricchromosomes (having very short arms) at the centromere\\n(centric fusion) with loss of short arms. The result of this\\nfusion is one very large chromosome and the other very small\\none. Individuals born with Robertsonian translocation maybe phenotypically normal but suffer from infertility and are\\nat higher risk of producing malformed children in the next\\nprogeny.\\nDELETIONS. Loss of genetic material from the chromosome\\nis called deletion. Deletion may be from the terminal or\\nmiddle portion of the chromosome. The examples of deletion\\nare: cri du chat  (named after cry of infant like that of a cat)\\nsyndrome (deletion of short arm of chromosome 5) andseveral cancers with hereditary basis (e.g. retinoblastomawith deletion of long arm of chromosome 13, Wilms’ tumour\\nwith deletion of short arm of chromosome 11).\\nINVERSION.  Inversion is a form of rearrangement invol-\\nving breaks of a single chromosome at two points. Inversion\\nmay be pericentric or paracentric, depending upon whether\\nthe rotation occurs at the centromere or at the acentric portion\\nof the arm of chromosome. Inversions are not associated withany abnormality.RING CHROMOSOME.  A ring of chromosome is formed\\nby a break at both the telomeric (terminal) ends of achromosome followed by deletion of the broken fragmentand then end-to-end fusion. The consequences of ringchromosome depend upon the amount of genetic materiallost due to break.\\nISOCHROMOSOME.  When centromere, rather than divi-\\nding parallel to the long axis, instead divides transverse to\\nthe long axis of chromosome, it results in either two shortarms only or two long arms only called isochromosomes.The example involving isochromosome of X-chromosome isseen in some cases (15%) of Turner’s syndrome.\\nSINGLE-GENE DEFECTS\\n(MENDELIAN DISORDERS)\\nIn order to unravel causes of disease at genetic level,\\nspectacular advances have been made in human genetics.With mapping of human genome consisting of about 30,000\\ngenes, it is possible to perform molecular profiling of diseases\\nat genetic level.\\nThe classic laws of inheritance of characteristics or traits\\nwere outlined by Austrian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866\\nbased on his observations of cross-breeding of red and white\\ngarden peas. Single-gene defects follow the classic mendelianpatterns of inheritance and are also called mendeliandisorders. These disorders are the result of mutation of a\\nsingle gene of large effect.\\nMUTATIONS.  The term mutation is applied to permanent\\nchange in the DNA of the cell. Mutations affecting germ cells\\nare transmitted to the next progeny producing inherited\\ndiseases,  while the mutations affecting somatic cells give rise\\nto various cancers  and congenital malformations.  Presently,\\nfollowing types of mutations have been described:\\ni) Point mutation  is the result of substitution of a single\\nnucleotide base by a different base i.e. replacement of an\\namino acid by  another e.g. in sickle cell anaemia there is point\\nmutation by substitution of glutamic acid by valine in the\\npolypeptide chain.\\nii)\\nStop codon or nonsense mutation  refers to a type of point\\nmutation in which the protein chain is prematurely\\nterminated or truncated.Figure 10.4 Common structural abnormalities of human chromosomes.\\n260SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniquesiii) Frameshift mutation  occurs when there is insertion or\\ndeletion of one or two base pairs in the DNA sequence e.g.\\nin cystic fibrosis of pancreas.\\niv) Trinucleotide repeat mutation  is characterised by\\namplification of a sequence of three nucleotides.\\nThus it can be summed up from above that single-gene\\ndefects are synonymous with various types of heritable\\nmutations. Currently, approximately 5000 single-gene defectshave been described—some major and others of minorconsequence. While most of these disorders are discussed inrelevant chapters later, the group of storage diseases (inbornerrors of metabolism) is considered below.\\nINHERITANCE PATTERN.  The inheritance pattern of\\ngenetic abnormalities may be\\n dominant or recessive, autosomal\\nor sex-linked:\\nA dominant gene * produces its effects, whether combined\\nwith similar dominant or recessive gene.  Recessive genes  are\\neffective only if both genes are similar. However, when both\\nalleles of a gene pair are expressed in heterozygous state, itis called codominant  inheritance . A single gene may express\\nin multiple allelic forms known as  polymorphism .\\nAutosomal dominant inheritance  pattern is characterised by\\none faulty copy of gene (i.e. mutant allele) in any autosomeand one copy of normal allele; disease phenotype is seen inall such individuals. Patients having autosomal dominantinheritance disease have 50% chance of passing on the diseaseto the next generation.\\nIn autosomal recessive inheritance , both copies of genes are\\nmutated. Usually, it occurs when both parents are carriersof the defective gene, i.e. having one normal allele and onedefective allele in each parent, and each parent passes ontheir defective gene to the next progeny causing disease.There is 25% chance of transmission of autosomal recessivedisease when both parents are carriers.\\nX-linked disorders  are caused by mutations in genes on X-\\nchromosome, derived from either one of the two X-chromosomes in females, or from the single X-chromosomeof the male. There are much fewer genes on Y-chromosomeand are determinant for testis; they are not known to causeany sex-linked disorder. Therefore, all sex-linked disordersare, in fact , X-linked disorders.\\nTable 10.1 lists important examples of groups of genetic\\ndisorders:  autosomal  recessive (the largest group), codominant\\n(intermediate), and dominant, and  sex-(X-) linked  recessive\\nand dominant disorders.\\nSTORAGE DISEASES\\n(INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM)\\nStorage diseases or inborn errors of metabolism are bio-chemically distinct groups of disorders occurring due togenetic defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, andproteins resulting in intracellular accumulation ofmetabolites. These substances may collect within the cellsthroughout the body but most commonly affected organ orsite is the one where the stored material is normally foundand degraded. Since lysosomes comprise the chief site ofintracellular digestion (autophagy as well as heterophagy),the material is naturally stored in the lysosomes, and hencethe generic name ‘lysosomal storage diseases’. Cells of mono-nuclear-phagocyte system are particularly rich in lysosomes;therefore, reticuloendothelial organs containing numerousphagocytic cells like the liver and spleen are most commonlyinvolved in storage disease.\\nBased on the biochemical composition of the accumulated\\nmaterial within the cells, storage diseases are classified intodistinct groups, each group containing a number of diseasesdepending upon the specific enzyme deficiency. A summary*\\nA particular characteristic of an individual is determined by a pair of\\nsingle genes,  located at the same specific site termed locus,  on a pair of\\nhomologous chromosomes. These paired genes are called alleles  which\\nmay be homozygous  when alike, and heterozygous  if dissimilar. Genotype\\nis the genetic composition of an individual while phenotype  is the effect\\nof genes produced.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 10.1: Important Examples of Mendelian Disorders\\n(Single Gene Defects).\\nI.

A few general comments can be made about all\\nstorage diseases:\\nAll the storage diseases occur either as a result of auto-\\nsomal recessive, or sex-(X-) linked recessive genetictransmission.\\nMost, but not all, of the storage diseases are lysosomal\\nstorage diseases. Out of the glycogen storage diseases, onlytype II (Pompe’s disease) is due to lysosomal enzymedeficiency.\\nA few important forms of storage diseases are described\\nbelow:\\nGlycogen Storage Diseases (Glycogenoses)\\nThese are a group of inherited disorders in which there is\\ndefective glucose metabolism resulting in excessive intra-cellular accumulation of glycogen in various tissues. Basedon specific enzyme deficiencies, glycogen storage diseasesare divided into 8 main types designated by Roman numeralsI to VIII. However, based on pathophysiology, glycogenstorage diseases can be divided into 3 main subgroups:\\n1.Hepatic forms  are characterised by inherited deficiency\\nof hepatic enzymes required for synthesis of glycogen forstorage (e.g. von Gierke’s disease or type I glycogenosis) or\\ndue to lack of hepatic enzymes necessary for breakdown ofglycogen into glucose (e.g. type VI glycogenosis).\\n2. Myopathic forms  on the other hand, are those disorders\\nin which there is genetic deficiency of glycolysis to form\\nlactate in the striated muscle resulting in accumulation ofglycogen in the muscles (e.g. McArdle’s disease or type Vglycogenosis, type VII disease).\\n3.\\nOther forms  are those in which glycogen storage does\\nnot occur by either hepatic or myopathic mechanisms. In\\nPompe’s disease or type II glycogenosis, there is lysosomalstorage of glycogen, while in type IV there is deposition ofabnormal metabolites of glycogen in the brain, heart, liverand muscles.\\nThe prototypes of these three forms are briefly considered\\nbelow.\\nVON GIERKE’S DISEASE (TYPE I GLYCOGENOSIS).\\nThis condition is inherited as an autosomal recessivedisorder due to deficiency of enzyme, glucose-6-phos-phatase. In the absence of glucose-6-phosphatase, excessof normal type of glycogen accumulates in the liver andalso results in hypoglycaemia due to reduced formationof free glucose from glycogen. As a result, fat is meta -\\nbolised for energy requirement leading to hyper -\\nlipoproteinaemia and ketosis.

Most prominent feature isenormous hepatomegaly with intracytoplasmic andintranuclear glycogen. The kidneys are also enlarged andshow intracytoplasmic glycogen in tubular epithelial cells.Other features include gout, skin xanthomas and bleedingtendencies due to platelet dysfunction.\\nPOMPE’S DISEASE (TYPE II GLYCOGENOSIS).  This is\\nalso an autosomal recessive disorder due to deficiency of a\\nlysosomal enzyme, acid maltase, and is the only example oflysosomal  storage disease amongst the various types of\\nglycogenoses. Acid maltase is normally present in most celltypes and is responsible for the degradation of glycogen. Itsdeficiency, therefore, results in accumulation of glycogen inmany tissues, most often in the heart and skeletal muscle,leading to cardiomegaly and hypotonia.\\nMcARDLE’S DISEASE (TYPE V GLYCOGENOSIS).  The\\ncondition occurs due to deficiency of muscle phosphorylase\\nresulting in accumulation of glycogen in the muscle(deficiency of liver phosphorylase results in type VIglycogenosis). The disease is common in 2nd to 4th decadesof life and is characterised by painful muscle cramps,especially after exercise, and detection of myoglobinuria inhalf the cases.\\nMucopolysaccharidoses (MPS)\\nMucopolysaccharidoses are a group of six inherited\\nsyndromes numbered from MPS I to MPS VI. Each of theseresults from deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymeinvolved in the degradation of mucopolysaccharides orglycosaminoglycans, and are, therefore, a form of lysosomalstorage diseases. Mucopolysaccharides which accumulate inthe MPS are: chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate,heparan sulphate and keratan sulphate. All these syndromesare autosomal recessive disorders except MPS II (Hunter’ssyndrome) which has X-linked recessive transmission.\\nSyndrome of MPS manifests in infancy or early childhood\\nand involves multiple organs and tissues, chiefly connectivetissues, liver, spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, kidneys,heart and brain. The mucopolysaccharides accumulate inmononuclear phagocytic cells, endothelial cells, intimalsmooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The material is finelygranular and PAS-positive by light microscopy. By electronmicroscopy, it appears in the swollen lysosomes and can beidentified biochemically as mucopolysaccharide.\\nGaucher’s Disease\\nThis is an autosomal recessive disorder in which there is\\nmutation in lysosomal enzyme,  acid β-glucosidase (earlier\\ncalled glucocerebrosidase), which normally cleaves glucosefrom ceramide. This results in lysosomal accumulation ofglucocerebroside (ceramide-glucose) in phagocytic cells ofthe body and sometimes in the neurons. The main sourcesof glucocerebroside in phagocytic cells are the membraneglycolipids of old leucocytes and erythrocytes, while thedeposits in the neurons consist of gangliosides.Clinically, 3 subtypes of Gaucher’s disease are identified\\nbased on neuronopathic involvement:\\nType I or classic form  is the adult form of disease in which\\nthere is storage of glucocerebrosides in the phagocytic cellsof the body, principally involving the spleen, liver, bonemarrow, and lymph nodes. This is the most common typecomprising 80% of all cases of Gaucher’s disease.\\nType II is the infantile form in which there is progressive\\ninvolvement of the central nervous system.\\nType III  is the juvenile form of the disease having features\\nin between type I and type II i.e. they have systemicinvolvement like in type I and progressive involvement ofthe CNS as in type II.\\nThe clinical features depend upon the clinical subtype of\\nGaucher’s disease. In addition to involvement of differentorgans and systems (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,lymphadenopathy, bone marrow and cerebral involvement),a few other features include pancytopenia, or thrombo-cytopenia secondary to hypersplenism, bone pains andpathologic fractures.\\nMicroscopy  shows large number of characteristically\\ndistended and enlarged macrophages called Gaucher cells\\nwhich are found in the spleen, liver, bone marrow andlymph nodes, and in the case of neuronal involvement, inthe Virchow-Robin space. The cytoplasm of these cells isabundant, granular and fibrillar resembling crumpledtissue paper. They have mostly a single nucleus butoccasionally may have two or three nuclei (Fig. 10.5, A,\\nC). Gaucher cells are positive with PAS, oil red O, and\\nPrussian-blue reaction indicating the nature ofaccumulated material as glycolipids admixed withhaemosiderin. These cells often show erythrophagocytosisand are rich in acid phosphatase.\\nNiemann-Pick Disease\\nThis is also an autosomal recessive disorder characterised\\nby accumulation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol due todefect in acid sphingomyelinase.\\nTwo types have been described: type A and B.\\nType A  is more common and typically presents in infancy\\nand is characterised by hepatosplenomegaly, lymph-adenopathy, rapidly progressive deterioration of CNS andphysical underdevelopment. About a quarter of patientspresent with familial amaurotic idiocy with characteristiccherry-red spots in the macula of the retina ( amaurosis  = loss\\nof vision without apparent lesion of the eye).\\nType B  develops later and has a progressive hepato-\\nsplenomegaly with development of cirrhosis due toreplacement of the liver by foam cells, and impaired lungfunction due to infiltration in lung alveoli.\\nMicroscopy  shows storage of sphingomyelin and choles-\\nterol within the lysosomes, particularly in the cells ofmononuclear phagocyte system. The cells of Niemann-Pick disease are somewhat smaller than Gaucher cellsand their cytoplasm is not wrinkled but is instead foamy263CHAPTER 10 Genetic and Paediatric Diseases\\nand vacuolated which stains positively with fat stains\\n(Fig. 10.5, B).  These cells are widely distributed in the\\nspleen, liver, lymph nodes, bone marrow, lungs, boweland brain.\\nMULTIFACTORIAL  INHERITANCE\\nSome normal phenotypic characteristics have alsomultifactorial inheritance e.g. colour of hair, eye, skin, heightand intelligence. Multifactorial disorders are those disorderswhich result from the combined effect of genetic compositionand environmental influences. Some common examples ofsuch disorders in which environmental influences mask themutant genes are as under:\\n1. Cleft lip and cleft palate2. Pyloric stenosis3. Diabetes mellitus4. Hypertension\\n5. Congenital heart disease\\n6. Coronary heart disease.\\nOTHER PAEDIATRIC DISEASES\\nAs mentioned in the foregoing discussion, many diseasesaffecting infancy and childhood are genetic or developmentalin origin. Here, other diseases affecting the period from birthto puberty are discussed under the heading of paediatricdiseases. This period is conventionally subdivided into 4stages:\\nNeonatal period:  birth to first 4 weeks\\nInfancy:  first year of life\\nEarly childhood:  1-4 years\\nLate childhood:  5-14 years\\nEach of these four stages has distinct anatomic,\\nphysiologic and immunologic development compared toadults and, therefore, has different groups of diseases uniqueto particular age groups. Before discussing these diseasesaffecting different age groups, a few general comments aboutthese stages can be made:1. Neonatal period  is the period of continuation of\\ndependent intrauterine foetal life to independent postnatalperiod. Therefore, this is the period of maximum risk to lifedue to perinatal causes (e.g. prematurity, low birth weight,perinatal infections, respiratory distress syndrome, birthasphyxia, birth trauma etc) and congenital anomalies. Ifadequate postnatal medical care is not provided, neonatalmortality is high. Neonatal mortality in first week after birthis about 10-times higher compared to second week, andshows improvement with every passing week at this stage.\\n2. In infancy,  the major health problems are related to\\ncongenital anomalies, infections of lungs and bowel, and\\nsudden infant death syndrome (often during sleep).\\n3. Young children from 1-4 years  are exposed to higher risk\\nof sustaining injuries, and manifest certain congenital\\nanomalies. Some malignant tumours are peculiar to this agegroup.\\n4. Older children from 5-14 years  too have higher risk of\\ninjuries from accidents and have other problems related to\\ncongenital anomalies and certain malignant tumours at thisage.\\nThus, hazardous effects of congenital anomalies are a\\ncommon denominator for all age groups from birth toadolescence. Specific tumours peculiar to infants andchildren are discussed along with discussion in relatedchapters of Systemic Pathology. However, a short note ongeneral aspects of this subject is given below.\\nTUMOURS OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD\\nTumours of infancy and childhood comprise 2% of all\\nmalignant tumours but they are the leading cause of deathin this age group exceeded only by accidents. Benign tumoursare more common than malignant neoplasms but they aregenerally of little immediate consequence. Another aspectrequiring consideration here is the difficulty in differentiatingbenign tumours from tumour-like lesions.\\nHISTOGENESIS.  Histogenetic evolution of tumours at\\ndifferent age groups takes place as under:Figure 10.5 Diagrammatic view of comparative features of typical\\nGaucher cell (A). B, typical macrophage in Niemann-Pick disease. C, A\\nGaucher cell (arrow) in bone marrow aspirate smear.\\n264SECTION I General Pathology and Basic TechniquesSome tumours have probably evolved in utero  and are\\napparent at birth or in immediate postnatal period. Such\\ntumours are termed developmental tumours.\\nMany other tumours originate in abnormally developed\\norgans and organ rests; they become apparent subsequentlyand are termed embryonic tumours.\\nIn embryonic tumours, proliferation of embryonic cells\\noccurs which have not reached the differentiation stage  essential\\nfor specialised functions i.e. the cells proliferate asundifferentiated or as partially differentiated  stem cells and an\\nembryonal tumour is formed.\\nTumours of infancy and childhood have some features of\\nnormal embryonic or foetal cells  in them which proliferate under\\ngrowth promoting influence of oncogenes and suffer frommutations which make them appear morphologicallymalignant.\\nUnder appropriate conditions, these malignant embryo-\\nnal cells may cease to proliferate  and transform into non-\\nproliferating mature differentiated cells e.g. a neonatalneuroblastoma may mature and differentiate into benignganglioneuroma; tissues in foetal sacrococcygeal teratomamay mature with age to adult tissues and is assigned betterprognosis.\\nThus, normal somatic cell maturation and neoplastic\\ndevelopment in embryonal tumours represent two oppositeends of ontogenesis,  with capability of some such tumours to\\nmature and differentiate to turn benign from malignant.\\nBenign Tumours and Tumour-like Conditions\\nMany of the benign tumours seen in infancy and childhood\\nare actually growth of displaced cells and masses of tissuesand their proliferation takes place along with the growth ofthe child. Some of these tumours undergo a phase ofspontaneous regression subsequently—a feature usually notseen in true benign tumours. While some consider suchlesions as mere ‘tumour-like lesions  or malformations’ , others\\ncall them benign tumours. A few such examples are as under:\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 10.3: Common Paediatric Benign Tumours and Tumour-like Lesions.\\nNomenclature Main Features\\nBENIGN TUMOURS\\ni. Haemangioma •\\nMost common in infancy\\n• Commonly on skin (e.g. port-wine stain)\\n• May regress spontaneously\\nii.

Its basis was application ofknowledge of morphological details of cells for diagnosis ofdisease in biopsy material. This generated interest of workerstowards obtaining cellular material by non-biopsy techniquesto arrive at the diagnosis. As a result, cytopathologicdiagnosis was initially introduced purely as Exfoliative\\nCytology  in the 1920s by Dr. George N. Papanicolaou.\\nSubsequently, success of bone marrow aspiration for diagnosis\\nof haematopoietic diseases generated interest in aspiration\\nbiopsy for diagnosis of solid lesions in the 1930s, which\\nevolved over the next three decades mainly in Scandinaviancountries in Europe and later spread to the rest of the worldto become the mainstay branch of diagnostic cytology knownas Interventional Cytology.\\nIn general, diagnostic cytology pertains to the\\ninterpretation of cells from the human body that eitherexfoliate (desquamate) spontaneously from epithelialsurfaces, or the cells are obtained from various organs/tissues by different clinical procedures. While histopathologicdiagnosis is based on interpretation of changes in tissuearchitecture, the cytopathologic diagnosis rests uponalterations in morphology observed in single cells or smallgroups of cells.\\nRole of Diagnostic Cytology\\nAmong the numerous applications of cytodiagnostic\\ntechniques, the following are more important:\\n1.Diagnosis and management of cancer.  In the field of\\noncology, establishing a ‘tissue diagnosis’ (i.e. pathologic\\ndiagnosis based on microscopic evidence of malignancy) isan essential pre-requisite for proper management of a cancerpatient.\\ni)Cytodiagnosis in its traditional role is a valuable adjunct\\nto histopathology for establishing the vital tissue diagnosis\\ne.g. diagnosis of lymphomas where imprint smears provevaluable, and in some respects superior to histopathologyin typing the lymphoma.\\ni\\ni) Cytologic techniques also provide a preliminary  diagnosis\\nof cancer for later confirmation by histopathology e.g.\\ndetection of ovarian cancer cells in ascitic fluid.\\nChapter 11 Basic Diagnostic Cytology* Chapter 11\\niii) In some fields, cytodiagnosis has replaced histopatho-logy as the primary method  of establishing a tissue diagnosis\\ne.g. in breast cancer, where positive cytologic report isconsidered sufficient for planning the management,obviating the need for diagnostic surgical biopsy.\\niv) Cytodiagnosis has a major role in the detection and diag-\\nnosis of clinically silent early cancer  e.g. carcinoma in situ  of\\nthe uterine cervix.\\nv) In the management of cancer, cytodiagnosis may help in\\nassessing response to therapy  e.g. cervical smears for response\\nto radiotherapy in carcinoma cervix, and urinary cytologyfor response to chemotherapy in carcinoma of the urinarybladder.\\nvi) In the follow-up  of previously diagnosed cases of cancer,\\nit is of particular value in detecting dissemination (metastasis)\\nor recurrence of tumour.\\n2. Identification of benign neoplasms.  This application is\\nderived from its ability to distinguish between benign and\\nmalignant neoplasms e.g. fibroadenoma of the breast versus\\ncarcinoma.\\n3. Intraoperative pathologic diagnosis.  In this role, cyto-\\ndiagnosis complements histopathologic diagnosis e.g.\\nimprint smears alongwith frozen section for breast lumps.\\n4. Diagnosis of non-neoplastic/inflammatory conditions.\\nCytodiagnosis allows recognition of specific conditions which\\n*The contribution of this chapter by Dr Rohit Sharma, MD, to the second edition of this book (1994) is gratefully acknowledged.267CHAPTER 11 Basic Diagnostic Cytology\\ndo not routinely require surgical intervention e.g.\\nHashimoto’s thyroiditis.\\n5. Diagnosis of specific infections.  A variety of bacterial,\\nviral, protozoal and fungal infections can be identified by\\ncytologic methods e.g. tubercle bacilli in lymph nodeaspirates, herpetic inclusions and Trichomonas in cervico-\\nvaginal smears, fungal hyphae in touch preparations fromdraining sinuses.\\n6. Cytogenetics.  Cytodiagnostic techniques can be emplo-\\nyed for chromosomal studies including leucocyte and tissue\\ncultures and for demonstrating sex-chromatin e.g. buccalsmear for Barr body.\\n7. Assessment of hormonal status in women. Vaginal\\nsmears accurately reflect changes in female sex hormonal\\nlevels e.g. to confirm the onset of menopause.\\n8. Identification of cell of origin.  For example, identifi-\\ncation of spermatogenic elements in aspirates from the testes\\nin cases of male infertility.\\nFor cytomorphological recognition of cancer, nuclear charac-\\nteristics are used to determine the presence or absence of\\nmalignancy (Table 11.1) . Cytoplasmic characteristics help in\\ntyping the malignancy e.g.keratinisation in squamous cell\\ncarcinoma, mucin droplets in adenocarcinoma, melaninpigment in melanomas.\\nBranches of Diagnostic Cytology\\nTwo branches of diagnostic cytology are currently recog-\\nnised: exfoliative and interventional.\\nEXFOLIATIVE CYTOLOGY.  This is the older branch that\\nessentially involves the study of cells spontaneously shed\\noff (as a result of continuous growth of epithelial linings)from epithelial surfaces into body cavities or body fluids.Exfoliative cytology is facilitated by the fact that the rate ofexfoliation is enhanced in disease-states thereby yielding alarger number of cells for study. In addition, cells for studymay also be obtained by scraping, brushing, or washingvarious mucosal surfaces (abrasive cytology).\\nINTERVENTIONAL CYTOLOGY.  This is the branch in\\nwhich samples are obtained by clinical procedures or\\nsurgical intervention. It is dominated by, and is virtuallysynonymous with, Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology(FNAC) which is also known as Aspiration Biopsy Cyto-logy (ABC). In interventional cytology, the cytopathologistoften performs the clinical procedure himself and interactswith the patient in contrast to exfoliative cytology wherethe samples are prepared and forwarded by the clinician tothe pathologist and the cytopathologist interprets them inisolation.\\nA brief  account of both main branches of cytology is\\ngiven below while their contrasting features are presentedin Table 11.2.\\nEXFOLIATIVE CYTOLOGY\\nType of samples that can be obtained from different organsystems for exfoliative cytodiagnosis are listed in Table 11.3.\\nApparently, a comprehensive review of each type of sampleis beyond the scope of this text. Cytology of female genitaltract is discussed in detail below while brief mention is madeabout other samples.\\nI. FEMALE GENITAL TRACT\\nSmears from the female genital tract have traditionally been\\nknown as ‘Pap smears’. These smears may be prepared by\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 11.2: Differences between Exfoliative and Interventional Cytology.\\nFeature Exfoliative Cytology Interventional Cytology\\n1.

They offer the advantages of both\\nand are recommended for routine population screening asthey allow detection of up to 97% of cervical cancers andabout 90% of endometrial cancers when properly prepared.\\nv)Triple (cervical-vaginal-endocervical or CVE)  smears  contain\\nthree distinct samples representing the ectocervix, vagina and\\nendocervix on three separate areas of the same slide. Thesesmears are also recommended for routine screening as theyallow localisation of lesions but are difficult to prepare.\\nvi)Endocervical and endometrial smears  may also be prepared\\nby aspirating the contents of the endocervical canal and\\nendometrial cavity respectively.\\nCELLS IN NORMAL COMBINED SMEARS.  Normally,\\ncombined smear contains two types of cells: epithelial and\\nothers (Fig. 11.1):\\nEpithelial cells.  There are 4 types of squamous epithelial cells\\nin the cervical smear: superficial, intermediate, parabasal and\\nbasal cells.  Morphological features of these cells are summed\\nup in Table 11.4.  A few variants of morphological forms and\\nother epithelial cells are as under:\\nNavicular cells  are boat-shaped intermediate cells with\\nfolded cell borders. These cells appear in latter half of themenstrual cycle, during pregnancy and menopause.Lactation cells  are parabasal cells with strongly acidophilic\\ncytoplasm. These cells are seen so long as lactation persists.\\nEndocervical cells  appear either as single dispersed nuclei\\ndue to degeneration, or as clusters of columnar cells givingit honey-combed appearance. Nuclei of endocervical cells arevesicular, with fine granular chromatin and contain 1-2\\nnucleoli, while the cytoplasm is slightly basophilic or\\nvacuolated.\\nEndometrial cells  are seen up to 12th day of menstrual\\ncycle. They are slightly smaller than endocervical cells,appear as tight rounded clusters of overlapping cells withmoderately dark oval nuclei and scanty basophilic,vacuolated cytoplasm.\\nTrophoblastic cells are seen following abortion or after\\ndelivery.Figure 11.1 Various types of epithelial cells seen in normal Pap\\nsmear.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 11.4: Squamous Epithelial Cells Found in Normal Combined (Fast) Smears.\\nCell Type Size Nuclei Cytoplasm Morphology\\nSuperficial 30-60 μm<  6 μm Polyhedral, thin, broad,\\ndark, pyknotic acidophilic or cyanophilic\\nwith keratohyaline granules.\\nIntermediate 20-40 μm 6-9 μm Polyhedral or elongated,\\nvesicular thin, cyanophilic with\\nfolded edges.\\nParabasal 15-25 μm 6-11 μm Round to oval, thick,\\nvesicular well-defined, basophilic\\nwith occasional small\\nvacuoles.\\nBasal 13-20 μm Large, (> one-half of cell\\nRound to oval,\\nvolume), hyperchromatic, deeply basophilic.may have small nucleoli\\n269CHAPTER 11 Basic Diagnostic CytologyOther cells.  Besides epithelial cells, other cells in cervical\\nsmears are leucocytes and Döderlein bacilli:\\nLeucocytes  in cervical smear include polymorphonuclear\\nneutrophils (in large numbers normally), lymphocytes\\n(isolated and entrapped in mucus normally), plasma cells(in chronic cervicitis), macrophages (normally in first 10 daysof the menstrual cycle) and multinucleate cells (in specificinflammation).\\nDöderlein bacilli  (Bacillus vaginalis/Lactobacillus acidophilis),\\nwhich belong to the group of lactobacilli, are the predominantorganisms of the normal vaginal flora. It is a slender, gram-positive, rod-like organism staining pale blue with thePapanicolaou technique. These organisms utilise theglycogen contained in the cytoplasm of intermediate andparabasal cells resulting in their disintegration (cytolysis).They are most numerous in the luteal phase and duringpregnancy.\\nAPPLICATIONS OF PAP SMEAR\\nCytohormonal Evaluation\\nAssessment of hormonal status is best carried out from lateral\\nvaginal smears although vaginal ‘pool’ or fast smears mayalso be used. Ideally, at least 3 smears obtained on alternatedays should be scrutinised and cytologic indices determinedfor each smear for accurate assessment.\\nSeveral indices are available for description of cyto-\\nhormonal patterns. The most commonly used are as under:\\ni)Acidophilic index (AI):  The relative proportion of cells\\ncontaining acidophilic (pink) and basophilic (blue) cytoplasm\\nare determined by AI.\\nii)Pyknotic index (PI):  The percentage of cells having small,\\ndark, shrunken nuclei (less than 6 μm in size) is determined\\nby PI. The PI is more reliable than AI as it is not influenced\\nby many of the cytoplasmic artefacts e.g. acidophilia causedby drying of smears prior to fixation that affects the latter.\\niii)Maturation index (MI):  MI is the most widely used\\nmethod. One hundred squamous cells are counted and\\ngrouped according to their type—parabasal, intermediate,or superficial (basal cells are virtually absent from normalvaginal smears). Their proportions are expressed as apercentage; for example 10/80/10 represents parabasal,intermediate and superficial cells respectively. Somerepresentative MIs at different stages of life are listed in\\nTable 11.5.\\nAbnormal Combined Smears\\nIn order to evolve a system acceptable to clinicians and\\ncytopathologists, National Cancer Institute Workshop in 1988developed the Bethesda System (TBS) for uniformity in\\nevaluation as well as limitations of reporting in cervico-vaginal cytopathology; this was subsequently modified in1991 and further updated in 2001. Criteria followed in theBethesda system are given in Chapter 26. Briefly, it has threebasic components in recommnedations:\\n1.Specimen adequacy: It is an important component of\\nquality assurance and provides feedback regarding sampling\\ntechnique. It implies properly labelled, adequately fixedsmears having sufficient number of evenly spread, wellpreserved cells as evaluated microscopically.\\n2.\\nGeneral categorisation: It includes categorising the smear\\nin one of the three broad categories: within normal limits,\\nbenign cellular changes, and epithelial cell abnormalities.\\n3. Descriptive diagnosis:  Final aspect of the Bethesda\\nsystem includes detailed description of the benign cellular\\nchanges or epithelial cell abnormalities in the smear.\\nBased on it, the cellular changes in cervical smears are\\ndescribed under 2 headings: non-neoplastic (or benign) andneoplastic epithelial cell abnormalities.\\nNON-NEOPLASTIC (BENIGN) CELLULAR CHANGES:\\ni) NON-SPECIFIC INFLAMMATORY CHANGES.\\nInflammatory changes not associated with any specificinfection or identifiable infectious agent (i.e. non-specificinflammation) are commonly seen in smears of the femalegenital tract as under:\\nAcute inflammatory changes  are characterised by an\\nincrease in the number of parabasal cells (due to disruptionof superficial layers of the epithelium resulting in exposureof deeper layers), cytoplasmic acidophilia and vacuolisation,leucocytic migration into cytoplasm, and perinuclear haloswith nuclear pyknosis or enlargement.\\nChronic inflammatory changes  (Reactive changes)  manifest\\nin squamous cells as nuclear enlargement, hyperchromatism,and nucleolar prominence, with multinucleation in someinstances. Endocervical cells may show reparativehyperplasia and/or squamous metaplasia.\\nii) SPECIFIC INFLAMMATORY CHANGES. Specific\\ninflammatory changes may be associated with a variety of\\ninfectious agents, the common among which are listed inTable 11.6.\\na)Bacterial agents:\\nN. gonorrhoeae  (the gonococcus) is a gram-negative diplo-\\ncoccus which is an intracellular micro-organism.

However, a definitive\\ndiagnosis requires bacterial culture.\\nGardnerella vaginalis,  a gram-negative rod, is a frequent\\ncause of bacterial vaginitis. It manifests in smears as bluestained cocco-bacillary organism covering and imparting agrainy appearance to affected squamous cells (so called ‘cluecells’) against a clean background devoid of Döderlein bacilli.\\nTuberculosis of the female genital tract usually manifests\\nas tuberculous salpingitis or endometritis, but may involvethe uterine cervix. While Mycobacterium tuberculosis  cannot\\nbe identified in Papanicolaou stained smears, tuberculousgranulomas composed of epithelioid macrophages withaccompanying Langhans’ giant cells may occasionally beidentified.\\nb)Viral agents:\\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV)  is one of the commonest\\nsexually-transmitted infections. There are 2 types of HPVs:\\nlow-risk and high-risk types. Low-risk HPV, most commonlytypes 6 and 11, are involved in causation of anogenital wartor condyloma acuminatum. High-risk HPV, most often types16 and 18, are strongly implicated in precancerous lesions ofectocervical epithelium leading to cervical cancer.Morphologically, smears from HPV-infected subjects showaggregates of rounded to oval squamous cells with bluntedcell margins, peripheral cytoplasmic condensation andcrisply outlined perinuclear halos, with dysplastic or\\ndegenerative changes of nuclei; these changes are collectively\\ntermed ‘koilocytotic changes.’ ( see Fig. 11.4). HPV can also\\nbe identified by Southern blot, PCR, in situ hybridization and\\nby hybrid capture.\\nGenital infection by herpes simplex virus (HSV)  commonly\\naffects the squamous epithelium of the vulva, vagina and\\ncervix, but may ascend to involve endocervical and\\nendometrial epithelium. Infected cells show enlarged nuclei\\nwith watery, ‘ground-glass’ chromatin, multinucleation with\\ninternuclear moulding, and intranuclear acidophilic\\ninclusions.\\nc)Fungal agents:\\nMoniliasis (infection by Candida albicans)  is the\\ncommonest fungal infection of the female genital tract and\\nis particularly associated with diabetes, pregnancy and use\\nof antibacterial agents (which alter the vaginal flora). Candida\\nappears in smears in two forms—the yeast form (unicellular)\\nappears as round to oval budding organisms withinconspicuous capsules, and the fungal form  (pseudohyphae)\\nas thin, elongated, pseudoseptate, bamboo-like filaments\\n(Fig. 11.2).\\nTorulopsis glabrata  causes less than 10% of mycotic vaginal\\ninfections. It is related to Candida, appears in smears asround budding organisms with thick capsule-like halos, and\\ndoes not form pseudohyphae in vivo.\\nd)Parasitic agents:\\nUp to 25% of adult women are estimated to harbour\\nTrichomonas vaginalis  in their lower genital tract.

SQUAMOUS CELL ABNORMALITIES:  The fully-\\ndeveloped invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine\\ncervix is preceded by a pre-invasive intraepithelial neoplastic\\nprocess that is recognisable on histologic and cytologicexamination.\\nMorphogenesis and nomenclature.  The earliest recognisable\\nchange is hyperplasia  of basal or reserve cells which normally\\nconstitute a single layer at the deepest part of the epithelium.\\nThe proliferating reserve cells next develop certain atypical\\nfeatures i.e. hyperchromasia and increased nuclear size. The\\ncontinued proliferation of these atypical cells with loss ofpolarity, a concomitant increase in mitotic activity, andprogressive involvement of more and more layers of the\\nepithelium is known as dysplasia  (disordered growth). When\\ndysplasia involves the full thickness of the epithelium and\\nthe lesion morphologically resembles squamous cellcarcinoma without invasion of underlying stroma, it is\\ntermed carcinoma in situ (CIS).  CIS further evolves through\\nthe stage of microinvasive carcinoma  (with depth of stromal\\ninvasion not exceeding 3 mm) into full-blown invasive\\nsquamous cell carcinoma .\\nPreviously depending on the degree of epithelial\\ninvolvement, three grades of dysplasia were recognised:\\nmild, moderate and severe. As the stages of dysplasia andCIS represented a continuous spectrum of lesions seen inthe precancerous state, they were collectively termed ‘cervical\\nintraepithelial neoplasia’ (CIN ) and categorised as under\\n(also see  Fig. 24.5):\\nCIN I Mild Primitive (atypical) cells,\\ndysplasia proliferating in lower\\nthird of epithelium.\\nCIN II Moderate Involvement up todysplasia middle-third of epithelium.\\nCIN III Severe Involvement of upper-third\\ndysplasia\\nof epithelium.\\nCarcinoma Involvement of fullin situ  (CIS) thickness of epithelium.\\nPresently,  the Bethesda system  divides squamous cell\\nabnormalities into four categories:\\nAtypical squamous cells of undetermined significance\\n(ASCUS)  which represents cellular changes falling short of\\nintraepithelial lesion.\\nLow-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (L-SIL) that\\nincludes CIN-I and cellular changes associated with HPVinfection.\\nHigh-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (H-SIL)  includes\\nCIN grade II, III and CIS.\\nSquamous cell carcinoma.\\nCytomorphology.  Precancerous states can be distinguished\\nfrom invasive carcinoma on the basis of cytomorphologicalfeatures observed in smears. In dysplastic epithelium,stratification and maturation of cytoplasm occurs above thelayers of proliferating primitive cells while the nuclearabnormalities persist. Cells exfoliating from the surface, thus,display cytoplasmic maturation and differentiation withnuclear atypia and are known as dyskaryotic cells.\\nThe character and type of dyskaryotic cells observed in\\nsmears reflect the severity of dysplasia:\\nIn mild dysplasia (CIN-I or L-SIL), maturation occurs in\\nthe upper two thirds of the epithelium and exfoliated\\ndyskaryotic cells are of the superficial type. These cells showFigure 11.4 L-SIL. The smear shows koilocytes having abundant\\nvacuolated cytoplasm and nuclear enlargement (arrow).Figure 11.5 H-SIL. The squamous cells have scanty cytoplasm and\\nmarkedly hyperchromatic nuclei having irregular nuclear outlines. The\\nbackground shows numerous PMNs.\\n272SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\ncytoplasmic vacuolation (koilocytosis) and nuclear\\nenlargement (Fig. 11.4).\\nWith increasing dysplasia (CIN-II and CIN-III, or H-SIL),\\nthe proliferating primitive cells reach closer to the epithelialsurface, less cytoplasmic maturation/differentiation occurs,and dyskaryotic intermediate and parabasal cells areobserved in smears  (Fig. 11.5).\\nProgression to CIS (CIN-III or H-SIL) manifests as subtle\\nalterations in cell arrangement and morphology (with\\npredominantly basal and parabasal cells in smears).\\nOnset of invasive carcinoma is heralded by the\\nappearance of macronucleoli, cytoplasmic orangeophilia andpresence of tumour diathesis (dirty, necrotic background)(Fig. 11.6).\\n2. GLANDULAR CELL ABNORMALITIES.  The Bethesda\\nsystem categorises glandular abnormalities as under:\\nAtypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS)\\nwhich represent nuclear atypia of endocervical and\\nendometrial cells exceeding reparative changes.Endocervical  and endometrial  adenocarcinoma , both of which\\ncan be detected from Pap smears; cytomorphological featuresallowing distinction between these two types of malignanciesare summed up in Table 11.7.\\nCells from  extrauterine cancers  may also be present in Pap\\nsmears, majority originating from the ovaries. Clues to theextrauterine origin of cancer cells include: the absence of atumour diathesis, arrangement of cancer cells in glandularand papillary configuration (accompanied by psammomabodies in some instances), and absence of dysplastic changesin coexistent cervico-endometrial cells.\\nAutomation in Cervical Cytology\\nIntroduction of automated devices like PapNet for primary\\nscreening is a major technologic achievement in recenttimes. Automation offers routine pre-screening of hundredsof Pap smears, decreasing the workload of cytopathologistsand at the same time providing quality assurance. It can beapplied to conventional Pap smears or to Thin-Preps\\n(discussed later).\\nII. RESPIRATORY TRACT\\nCellular material from the respiratory tract may be obtained\\nas a result of spontaneous expectoration (sputum), aspirationor brushing during bronchoscopic procedures.\\n1. SPUTUM EXAMINATION.  Sputum is produced by a\\nspontaneous deep cough bringing up material from small\\nairways and alveoli. The cough reflex may also be triggeredartificially by aerosol-inhalation of cough-stimulatingsubstances (e.g. propylene glycol with hypertonic saline).Sputum examination is advantageous as samples are easilyobtained and the cellular content is representative of theentire respiratory tract (satisfactory specimens allowdiagnosis of over 80% of lung cancers). However, a largenumber of cells have to be scrutinised and the specimendoes not allow localisation of the lesion within therespiratory tract.\\n2. BRONCHIAL ASPIRATION (WASHINGS) AND\\nBRONCHIAL BRUSHING.  Cellular material obtained by\\naspiration brushing or bronchial washing, or by bronchio-Figure 11.6 Invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

However, bronchoscopicprocedures are unpleasant for patients, time-consuming andrequire considerable expertise.\\nIII. GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT\\nLesions in the oral cavity may be sampled by scraping the\\nsurface with wooden and metal tongue-depressors. For theoesophagus and stomach, samples are obtained under directvision by brushing or lavage through fibreoptic endoscopes.For cytologic samples from the stomach, the older methodof blind lavage through a Ryle’s tube using isotonic saline orRinger’s solution have largely been replaced nowadays bydirect mucosal visualisation by the endoscopist and collectionof cytologic sample while doing a biopsy. Cytology samplesfrom the colon may also obtained by brushing duringcolonoscopy or lavage following enema to clean the colon.\\nIV. URINARY TRACT\\n1.URINARY SEDIMENT CYTOLOGY.  Cytological\\nevaluation of the urinary tract is most often carried out by\\nexamining the sediment of voided or catheterised specimensof urine. It is convenient for the patient and a useful methodfor study of both the upper and lower urinary tracts, providedthe samples are collected and processed in the correct manner(page 276). While voided specimens are satisfactory in men,catheterisation is often preferred in women to avoid contami-nation by vaginal cells and menstrual blood.\\n2.\\nBLADDER IRRIGATION (WASHINGS).  Washings of\\nthe urinary bladder obtained at cystoscopy are preferred in\\nsymptomatic patients when bladder tumours are suspected.The procedure provides excellent cytological preparations.\\n3. RETROGRADE CATHETERISATION. For suspected\\nlesions of the upper urinary tract, voided urine is usually\\nsatisfactory. While renal parenchymal cells are infrequent inurine, material obtained from the renal pelvis and uretercontains adequate quantity of these cells. In some instances,retrograde catheterisation and brushing of the ureter andrenal pelvis are utilised for localisation of lesions.\\n4. PROSTATIC MASSAGE.  Prostatic secretions are\\nobtained by prostatic massage and the sample is collected\\ndirectly onto a glass slide and smeared. The procedure israrely used nowadays with the advent of direct sampling ofthe prostate by FNAC.\\nDiagnostic Utility of Urinary Cytology\\nWhile evaluating the utility of urinary cytology in the diag-\\nnosis of urothelial tumours, following aspects need to be keptin mind:\\n1.Papillary tumours of low-grade  are lined by urothelium\\nshowing no morphological abnormalities or only slight\\ncellular and nuclear abnormalities. Such tumours cannot bediagnosed on cytologic material with any degree of certainty.2.High-grade papillary tumours,  sessile tumours and carci-\\nnoma in situ where urothelial cells exhibit cytomorphological\\nabnormalities, are readily diagnosed by urinary cytology.\\n3.Urothelial tumours are often synchronous or meta-\\nchronous and may involve different regions of the urinary tract.\\nUrinary cytology is, thus, of immense value in the follow-up\\nof patients with previously diagnosed urothelial tumours.\\nV\\n. BODY FLUIDS\\nFor the sake of convenience, the cytology of body fluids can\\nbe discussed under following two headings:A. Effusions in body cavitiesB.\\nFluids of small volume.\\nA. EFFUSIONS\\nEffusion refers to the accumulation of fluid in any of the three\\nbody cavities (pleural, pericardial and peritoneal). Aneffusion in the peritoneal cavity is also known as ascites.Effusions have traditionally been classed as transudates orexudates. This distinction is important in diagnostic cytologyas malignant effusions are invariably exudates with a proteincontent greater than 3 gm/dl ( see Table 5.1, page 96).\\nDiagnostic cytology of effusions on samples obtained by\\nparacentesis is mainly related to the identification ofmalignancy, and wherever possible, its classification. Inbenign effusions, cytological findings are mostly non-specific.\\nCellular Components in Effusions\\nTwo main primary component cells of effusions are\\nmesothelial cells and macrophages or histiocytes. Effusioncauses disruption of the mesothelial lining and these cellscollect in the fluid individually or as small groups.Macrophages appear as mononuclear cells of the size ofmesothelial cells distributed singly or as loose clusters.However, macrophages have ill-defined cell bordercompared to mesothelial and may have cytoplasmicvacuoles. Moreover, the nuclei in the macrophages areeccentric and kidney-shaped while those of mesothelial cellsare central and round.\\nIn addition, the effusion may have the following cellular\\ncomponents:\\nCELLS IN BENIGN EFFUSIONS.  These include reactive\\nproliferations of mesothelial cells in inflammation,\\npolymorphonulcear neutrophils in acute suppurativeinflammation, and lymphocytes in chronic fluid collections.When lymphocytes are dominant cells in the effusion fluidin fibrin-rich background, the possibility of tuberculosis isconsidered. In tuberculous effusions, granulomas, epithelioidcells or Langhans’ giant cells may not be seen; stain fortubercle bacilli may sometimes be of value.\\nCELLS IN MALIGNANT EFFUSIONS.  Malignant cells in\\neffusion may of origin from primary tumour (e.g.\\nmesothelioma) or from secondary/metastatic tumour; thelatter being more common the case.\\nMesothelioma.  It is uncommon and is more often epithelial\\ntype since fibrous mesothelioma does not exfoliate cells in274SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nthe effusion. Epithelial cells of mesothelioma require to be\\ndistinguished from adenocarcinoma cells.\\nAdenocarcinomas.  These are the most common malignant\\ncellular component in the effusions. They mostly represent\\nmetastasis from primary adenocarcinomas such as from thestomach, lung, breast, colon, and ovary. Less frequent sourcesare adenocarcinoma of the biliary system, pancreas and liver.Most adenocarcinomas show similar morphologicappearance and thus it may not be possible to comment onthe possible primary site of origin of the adenocarcinoma onmorphology alone (Fig. 11.7).\\nSquamous cell carcinoma.  Effusion may rarely have\\nmalignant squamous cells in it and represent metastasis fromcarcinoma lung, oesophagus or uterine cervix.\\nSmall cell carcinoma.  Cytologic features of small cell\\ncarcinoma of the lung are quite characteristic—hyper-\\nchromatic moulded nuclei and scanty or no cytoplasm.\\nLymphomas-leukaemias.  Effusions may sometimes have\\nmalignant cells of leukameia and lymphoma in line with\\nprimary disease in the body.\\nB. FLUIDS OF SMALL VOLUME\\nOf the miscellaneous fluids included in this category, the\\nmost common samples submitted for cytological evaluationare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and seminal fluid (semen).\\nCerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)\\nCSF examination is an important part of complete neurologic\\nevaluation, both in non-neoplastic and neoplastic diseasesof the central nervous system. Samples are usually obtainedby lumbar puncture. Factors that are critical to the successfulcytological evaluation of CSF are as under:\\ni) Speed of delivery to the laboratory and immediate\\nprocessing, as diagnostic material may disintegrate within\\nan hour resulting in false-negative diagnosis.ii\\n) Correct cytological processing and technique, since the\\ncell yield of CSF is generally low and faulty technique mayresult in loss of cellular material or poor morphology.\\nNormal CSF.  CSF is an ultrafiltrate of plasma with a total\\nvolume of about 150 ml (in the adult). Cell content is low\\n(0-4/ μl) comprising mainly lymphocytes or monocytes.\\nCSF in non-neoplastic diseases.  Changes in CSF in various\\nnon-neoplastic diseases are discussed in Chapter 30 ( see\\n Table 30.1).\\nCSF in neoplastic disease.  Neoplasms that are in direct\\ncontact with the CSF are most likely to shed cells which are\\nrecoverable for scrutiny. Metastatic cancers (leukaemia,lymphoma and adenocarcinoma), medulloblastomas, andependymomas shed the greatest amount of material. Though\\nmeningioma occurs in the subarachnoid space, it rarely\\nexfoliates sufficient material for diagnosis. Low-gradegliomas do not generally shed sufficient cells although high-grade gliomas may yield adequate cellular material for\\ndiagnosis.\\nSeminal Fluid (Semen)\\nExamination of seminal fluid (semen analysis) is one of the\\ntests for investigating infertile couples, and is also used to\\ncheck the adequacy of vasectomy. Samples are obtained by\\nmasturbation or coitus interruptus after observing at least 4days of sexual abstinence and assessed on the following lines:\\n1.Volume.  Normal volume is between 2.5 and 5 ml.\\n2.Viscosity and pH.  When ejaculated, semen is fairly viscid\\nbut liquefies in about 10 to 30 minutes. It is usually alkaline\\n(pH about 8).\\n3\\n. Motility.  Normally, within 2 hours of ejaculation, at least\\n60% of the spermatozoa are vigorously motile; in 6 to 8 hours\\n25 to 40% are still motile.\\n4. Count.  Counting is done in a Neubauer chamber after\\nsuitable dilution. Normally, 60 million or more spermatozoa\\nare present per ml. Currently, automated counters for semen\\nare also available.\\n5. Morphology.  Stained smears are used to assess\\nmorphology. Normally, not more than 20% of spermatozoa\\nare morphologically abnormal (e.g. double-head, pointed-head, or swollen).\\n6. Fructose.  Seminal fructose estimation (normal levels 150-\\n600 mg/dl) complements cytological analysis. Low levels of\\nseminal fructose indicate obstruction at the level of\\nejaculatory ducts.\\nResults of semen analysis need to be interpreted with\\ncaution as infertility is caused by several factors in the couple.\\nAs discussed in Chapter 23, other causes of infertility need\\nto be evaluated before it is ascribed to abnormalities in semen.Even specimens with several abnormal features need notnecessarily be the cause of infertility.\\nVI. BUCCAL SMEARS FOR SEX CHROMATIN BODIES\\nSex-specific chromatin bodies are observed in interphase\\nnuclei and comprise the Barr body (X chromatin) and theFigure 11.7 Pleural fluid positive for signet ring cells (adeno-\\ncarcinoma stomach). There are large number of malignant cells scattered\\nsingly or in small clusters having characteristic cytoplasmic vacuoles,nuclear hyperchromasia and prominent nucleoli.\\n275CHAPTER 11 Basic Diagnostic Cytologyfluorescent or F body (Y chromatin). The number of Barr\\nbodies observed in interphase nuclei is one less than the\\nnumber of X chromosome (n–1), whereas the number of F\\nbodies observed is equal to the number of Y chromosomespresent (n). In effect, the Barr body is specific for femalesand the F body for males (page 257).\\n1. DEMONSTRATION OF BARR BODY (X CHROMA-\\nTIN). In buccal smears, the Barr body appears as a plano-\\nconvex mass about 1 μm in diameter applied to the inner\\nsurface of the nuclear membrane. The interphase nuclei ofone hundred intermediate squamous epithelial cells arescrutinised. In normal females, Barr bodies are present in at\\nleast 20% of nuclei (Fig. 11.8, A) . Males have a Barr body\\ncount of less than 2%. Vaginal smears may also be used for\\nBarr body counts (page 257).\\n2. DEMONSTRATION OF THE F BODY (Y CHROMA-\\nTIN).  Demonstration of the F body requires fluorescent\\nstaining in contrast to the Barr body which may be observedon routine Papanicolaou-stained smears. On staining buccal\\nsmears with quinacrine mustard, the intensely fluorescent F\\nbody is observed in about 60% of interphase nuclei in malesand in less than 8% of nuclei in females. The F body is alsodemonstrable in the nuclei of lymphocytes in a peripheral\\nblood film stained with quinacrine mustard.\\n3. COUNTING OF DRUMSTICK APPENDAGE.  The\\npresence and frequency of drumstick appendages attached\\nto nuclei of polymorphonuclear leucocytes on a peripheral\\nblood film may also be used for determining sex. At least500 neutrophilic leucocytes are scrutinised in a Romanowsky-stained blood film. Genetic females show drumsticks in 3-\\n6% of neutrophils (Fig. 11.8, B).  In males, the frequency of\\ndrumsticks is less than 0.3%.\\nTECHNIQUES IN EXFOLIATIVE CYTOLOGY\\nA brief resume of methods for collection of specimens and\\nprocessing of samples for exfoliative cytodiagnosis isoutlined below under 4 headings: collection, fixation and\\nfixatives, processing in the laboratory, and staining.\\nA. Collection of Samples\\n1. PREPARATION OF COMBINED (FAST) SMEARS.\\nSmears should not be taken during menstrual bleeding. The\\npatient should not douche for at least 24 hours before the\\nsmear is obtained.\\ni) Smears are obtained under direct vision after introducing\\na Cusco’s speculum with the patient in lithotomy position.ii)\\nIdeally, lubricants and medical jellies should not be used\\nfor introducing the speculum since use of lubricants results\\nin contamination of the smear. If required, the speculum maybe moistened with a few drops of normal saline.\\niii) The posterior fornix of the vagina is aspirated with a\\nblunt-ended glass pipette fitted with a rubber bulb. A drop of\\nthe aspirate is placed at the unlabelled end of a glass slide.iv) The ectocervix is sampled with the Ayre’s spatula\\n(Fig. 11.9). The longer limb of the spatula is fitted into the\\nexternal os and the spatula rotated through 360° to sample\\nthe entire cervix. The scraped material on the spatula is thenplaced on the drop aspirated from the vaginal pool and thesmear prepared with the spatula itself or with the tip of thegloved finger (cotton swabs may be used instead of the Ayre’sspatula, although the quality of smears is not as good).\\nv)Thin uniform smears should be prepared and the slide\\nimmediately immersed in fixative to avoid artefacts in cells\\ncaused by drying.\\nvi)\\nSmears should be transported to the laboratory in the\\nfixative in a Coplin’s jar (discussed later).\\nSlides should ideally be labelled by using a diamond\\npencil. If labels of sticking plaster are used, the labels must\\nnot come into contact with the fixative.\\n2. LIQUID-BASED CYTOLOGY PREPARATIONS (THIN\\nPREPS). This is a special technique for preparation of\\ngynaecologic and non-gynaecologic samples which providesuniform monolayered dispersion of cells on smears, withoutoverlapping or clump formation. It is a pre-requisite forquantitative analysis and automated devices.\\n3. PREPARATION OF LATERAL VAGINAL SMEARS\\n(LVS).  The LVS is obtained by scraping the lateral walls of\\nthe upper third of the vagina (at the level of the cervicalexternal os) with the flat surface of a wooden tonguedepressor and smearing the material directly onto labelledslides. The patient is prepared and positioned as describedfor the combined (fast) smear.\\n4. COLLECTION OF SPUTUM.  Fresh, unfixed, early\\nmorning specimens resulting from overnight accumulation\\nof secretions are best for diagnostic purposes. A minimumof at least three specimens collected on three successive daysshould be examined. The patient is instructed to coughdeeply on waking up and to expectorate all sputum into aFigure 11.8 Sex chromatin. A, Buccal smear showing condensation\\nof chromatin under the nuclear membrane. B, Blood film showing\\npresence of drumstick appendage attached to a nuclear lobe of theneutrophil.\\n276SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nclean, dry, wide-mouthed glass container or a petridish. Care\\nshould be taken to avoid spitting into the container. Thecontainer is capped or covered, labelled and transported tothe laboratory where smears are prepared.\\n5. BRONCHIAL MATERIALS.  All aspirated bronchial\\nsecretions, lavage, washings and brushings must be\\ndespatched to the laboratory without delay. If immediatedespatch is not possible, the sample should be collected infixative (50% ethanol in volumes equal to that of the sample).\\n6. BUCCAL SMEARS.  The mouth is rinsed with water or\\nnormal saline and the buccal mucosa scraped vigorously with\\na wooden or metal tongue depressor. The material is smeareddirectly onto labelled glass slides which are placed in fixative.\\n7. G.I. CYTOLOGY.  In a case of suspected malignancy or\\nspecific infections of GI tract, or for screening for Barrett’s\\noesophagus, cytologic examination is indicated. The cytologyspecimen is collected during fibreoptic endoscopy of the partbeing visualised.\\n8. URINE.  Fresh catheterised specimens are preferred in\\nfemale patients while voided urine is satisfactory in males.\\nAfter initial morning voiding (which is discarded),\\nsamples of about 50 to 100 ml are collected on three\\nconsecutive days. Hydration by forced intake of fluids (1 glassof water every 30 minutes over 3 hour period) is recom-mended by some workers for production of high volumespecimens. If delay is anticipated in despatch to thelaboratory, the sample should be collected in an equal volumeof 50% ethanol.\\nThe initial morning specimen is discarded as cells\\ndeteriorate extremely quickly in acidic urine, and themorphology of cells accumulating overnight in bladder urineis distorted to an extreme degree. For the same reason,24-hour collections of urine are useless for cytodiagnosticpurposes.\\n9. EFFUSIONS.  Pericardial, pleural and peritoneal fluids\\nare obtained by paracentesis. As these fluids are often\\nexudative in character, they may clot after removal fromrespective cavities. Anticoagulants may be used to preventcoagulation—heparin (3-5 units per ml), 3.8% sodium citrate(1 ml per 10 ml), or EDTA (1 mg per ml) may be used for thispurpose.\\nIf the fluids cannot be processed within 12 hours of\\ncollection, an equal volume of 50% ethanol or 10% formalinshould be added.\\n10. CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF).  CSF samples should\\nbe despatched without delay to the laboratory for immediate\\nprocessing as the cells contained are extremely fragile. A gapof even 1 hour between removal and processing may resultin loss of diagnostic cellular material.\\n11. SEMEN.  Samples of seminal fluid obtained by\\nmasturbation are best collected at the laboratory. Samples\\nobtained by coitus interruptus are collected in clean, dry testtubes (or vials) and transported to the laboratory within 30minutes. The patient is instructed to note the time ofejaculation.\\nB. Fixation and Fixatives\\nAll material for cytological examination must be properly\\nfixed to ensure preservation of cytomorphological details.Methods of fixation vary depending upon the type of stainingemployed:\\nMaterial for exfoliative cytodiagnosis is usually wet-fixed\\ni.e. smears are immersed in fixative without allowing themto dry. These smears are then stained with Papanicolaou(Pap) or haematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stains.\\nSometimes, exfoliative cytology smears are air-dried  for\\nuse with the Romanowsky stains as are used in haematologicstudies. In Romanowsky staining, fixation is effected duringthe staining procedure.\\n1. ROUTINE FIXATIVES.  The ideal fixative for routine use\\nis Papanicolaou’s fixative comprising a solution of equal parts\\nof ether and 95% ethanol. However, the flammability of ethermakes it hazardous. Most laboratories use 95% ethanol alonewith excellent results. Where ethanol is not available, 100%methanol, 95% denatured alcohol, or 85% isopropyl alcohol(isopropanolol) may be used.\\nSmears prepared at the bedside as well as those prepared\\nin the laboratory from fluid samples are immediately placedin 95% ethanol without allowing them to dry prior to fixation.\\nDrying causes distortion of cells and induces cytoplasmicstaining artefacts. Fixation time of 10 to 15 minutes at roomtemperature is adequate. Smears may also be left in thefixative for 24 hours or more without any detrimental effectas regards cytomorphological detail. Smears should betransported to the laboratory in the fixative; screw-cappedCoplin jars are best for this purpose.\\n2. COATING FIXATIVES.  Coating fixatives are applied as\\naerosol-sprays or with a dropper to the surface of freshlyFigure 11.9 Method of obtaining cervical smear with Ayre spatula\\n(fast smear).\\n277CHAPTER 11 Basic Diagnostic Cytologyprepared smears. While commercial preparations (e.g.\\ncytospray) are available, a standard hairspray with a highalcohol content is also a suitable alternative. Smears whilestill wet, are placed face-up on a table and sprayed with thenozzle held at a distance of 10 to 12 inches. A period of 10minutes is sufficient for drying of coated smears, which may\\nthen be wrapped or put in a box for transport to thelaboratory. Coating fixatives are ideal when unstained smears\\nare to be transported over long distances.\\n3. SPECIAL PURPOSE FIXATIVES.  Buffered neutral\\nformalin, Bouin’s fluid and picric acid are used for specific\\npurposes when required. Formalin vapour fixation is alsoemployed for some staining procedures.\\n4. PRESERVATION OF FLUID SAMPLES.  Samples of\\nfluids are best submitted to the laboratory in a fresh state for\\nimmediate processing. Where a delay is anticipated indespatch to the laboratory or in processing, the sample iscollected in a suitable preservative for ‘prefixation’ so that\\ncellular morphology is preserved. When the samples have\\nbeen processed and smears prepared, ‘fixation’ is effectedas described earlier.\\nFluid samples with a high protein content (e.g. peri-\\ncardial, pleural and peritoneal fluids) may be preservedunder refrigeration for up to 12 hours without prefixation.However, fluids with a low protein content (e.g. urine andcerebrospinal fluid) deteriorate in 1 to 2 hours even if\\nrefrigerated. Fluids with low pH (e.g. gastric lavage samples)\\nmust be collected in pre-cooled preservative since cellsdeteriorate extremely rapidly in such specimens.\\nThe best preservative for general use is 50% ethanol in\\nvolumes equal to that of the fluid sample. Ninety-five per\\ncent ethanol precipitates proteins and hardens the sediment\\nmaking smear preparation difficult; it is used only for gastricaspirates. Pericardial, pleural and peritoneal fluids may bepre-fixed with an equal volume of 10% formalin if ethanol is\\nnot available. Solutions containing ether and acetone are not\\nused as preservatives as they cause extreme hardening ofthe sediment making smear preparation virtually impossible.\\nC. Processing of Samples in the Laboratory\\n1.PREPARED SMEARS.  Smears prepared at the bedside\\nand wet-fixed in ethanol need no further processing in the\\nlaboratory prior to staining.\\n2.SPUTUM.  The sample is prepared as under:\\ni) The sample is placed in a petridish and inspected against\\na dark background.\\nii\\n) Bloody, discoloured or solid particles are removed with\\nwooden applicator sticks and placed on glass slides. Strands\\nof ropy mucus are also selected (exfoliated cells adhere to\\nmucus strands).\\niii) Clean glass slides are used to crush the particles/mucus\\nand spread the material evenly.\\niv) Four such smears are prepared and immediately placed\\nin 95% ethanol for fixation.\\n3. FLUID SPECIMENS.  Large volumes of fluid received\\nare allowed to stand in the refrigerator for half to one hour.After that, all except the bottom 200 ml is discarded. The\\nretained fluid is then processed. In specimens containing\\nexcessive amounts of blood, erythrocytes may be lysed by\\nthe addition of 1 ml of g lacial acetic acid for every 50 ml of\\nspecimen.\\nCommonly employed techniques for processing of fluids\\nare as under:\\nSediment smears.  The sample is poured into 50 ml centrifuge\\ntubes and centrifuged at 600 g for 10 minutes. (To achieve a\\nrelative centrifugal force of 600 g, the speed of the centrifuge\\nin revolutions per minute varies with the rotating radius ofthe centrifuge. With a rotating radius of 25 cm the requiredspeed is 1500 rpm).\\nFollowing centrifugation, the supernatant is decanted and\\nsmears prepared from the sediment or cell button byrecovering the material with a glass pipette or a platinumwire loop. Smear preparation from samples collected in apreservative require albuminised slides as cell adhesivenessis reduced by prefixation. Smears are wet-fixed in 95%ethanol (or air-dried in some instances).\\nCytocentrifuge and membrane filter preparations.  These\\nmethods are most useful for small volume fluids of low cell\\ncontent. The interested reader is referred to specialised textsfor descriptions of these methods.\\nD\\n. Staining of Smears\\nThree staining procedures are commonly employed:\\nPapanicolaou and H&E stains are used for wet-fixed smears\\nwhile Romanowsky stains are used for air-dried smears.\\n1. PAPANICOLAOU STAIN.  Papanicolaou staining is the\\nbest method for routine cytodiagnostic studies. Threesolutions are used comprising a nuclear stain and twocytoplasmic counter-stains. Harris’ haematoxylin is thenuclear stain. Orange G (OG-6) and eosin-alcohol (EA-65 orEA-50) are the two cytoplasmic counterstains which impartthe orange and cyanophilic tints to cytoplasm respectively.\\n2. H & E STAIN.  The stain is essentially the same as that\\nused for histological sections. Harris’ haematoxylin is the\\nnuclear stain, and eosin is the cytoplasmic counterstain.\\n3. ROMANOWSKY STAINS.  Romanowsky stains used in\\nhaematological preparations may also be used for cytological\\nsmear preparations. Leishman’s, May-Grünwald-Giemsa(MGG) and Wright’s stains are most commonly used.\\nINTERVENTIONAL CYTOLOGY\\nIn interventional cytology, samples are obtained byaspiration or surgical biopsy. This branch includes fine needleaspiration cytology, imprint cytology, crush smear cytologyand biopsy sediment cytology.\\nI. FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION CYTOLOGY\\nInterventional cytology is virtually synonymous with Fine\\nNeedle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC). The technique hasgained wide acceptance in the last four decades and isincreasingly being used to sample a wide variety of body278SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\ntissues. Almost all organ systems are accessible to the fine\\nneedle and versatility of the technique has enormouslyincreased the scope of diagnostic cytology. The applicationsand advantages of FNAC, its procedure, complications andlimitations are detailed below.\\nA. APPLICATIONS OF FNAC\\nIn routine practice, FNAC is most often used for diagnosis\\nof palpable mass lesions. Palpable lesions commonlysampled are: breast masses, enlarged lymph nodes, enlargedthyroid and superficial soft tissue masses. The salivaryglands, palpable abdominal lesions and the testicles are alsofrequently sampled for FNAC. Other sites and lesionsaccessible to FNAC are the prostate, pelvic organs, bone andjoint spaces, lungs, retroperitoneum and orbit.\\nB. ADVANTAGES OF FNAC\\ni) FNAC is an OPD procedure and requires no hospitalisation\\nwhile surgical biopsies are obtained in the operation theatre\\nand hospitalisation is often required.\\nii)No anaesthesia is required (except in specific circum-\\nstances), while surgical biopsy is performed under local or\\ngeneral anaesthesia.\\niii)The procedure is quick, safe and painless .\\niv)Multiple attempts (or repeating the procedure) are possi-\\nble without inconvenience, whereas repeating a surgical\\nbiospy is uncomfortable and inconvenient for the patient.\\nv) Results are obtained rapidly with reports being available\\nin a matter of hours (turn-around time of 2 to 24 hours\\ndepending on the urgency), while histopathological reportsare available after a longer duration (turn-around time of 2to 4 days on account of time required for processing andsectioning of tissues).\\nvi\\n) It is a low-cost procedure which is cost-effective .\\nvii) As the cytopathologist performs the procedure himself,\\nhe gains first-hand knowledge  of the clinical findings which\\nfacilitates interpretation of slides and enhances diagnosticaccuracy.C. GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR FNAC\\nMaterials\\nFor performing FNAC, a syringe with a well-fitting needle,\\nsyringe holder, some microscopic glass slides and a suitablefixative are the only material required in most instances(Fig. 11.10):\\nNEEDLES.  Fine needles range from 25 to 20 gauge (0.6 mm\\nto 0.9 mm outer diameter). The standard 21 gauge disposable\\nneedle of 38 mm length is suitable for routine transcutaneousFNAC of palpable masses; 25 or 24 gauge disposable needles\\nof 25 mm length are used for lymph nodes and in children.Larger needles, 80 to 160 mm in length, are required forsampling the lung and abdominal viscera; 22 to 20 gaugeChiba spinal puncture needles may be profitably employedfor this purpose. Needles of up to 200 mm length are usedfor transrectal and transvaginal FNAC of the prostate andovary respectively. Aspiration of bony lesions may require18 gauge (1 mm outer diameter) needles although superficiallytic lesions are adequately sampled with a 21 gauge needle.\\nSYRINGES.  Syringes of 10 to 20 ml capacity are suitable.\\nSyringe holders such as the Franzen handle permit a single-\\nhand grip during aspiration, employing disposable syringes.For needles with metal hubs (e.g. spinal puncture needles),disposable syringes should be used to ensure a proper fitbetween the needle hub and syringe nozzle.\\nGLASS SLIDES AND FIXATIVE.  Four or six standard\\nmicroscopic glass slides and a Coplin jar containing 95% ethyl\\nalcohol (as a fixative) are the only other material requiredfor routine FNAC.\\nMethod of Aspiration\\nTranscutaneous FNAC of palpable masses is routinely per-\\nformed without anaesthesia as per the following procedure;aspiration of sites/lesions requiring anaesthesia or specialtechnique are discussed separately (Fig. 11.11):\\ni)The patient is asked to lie down  in a position that best\\nexposes the target area.Figure 11.10 Equipments required for transcutaneous FNAC.\\n279CHAPTER 11 Basic Diagnostic Cytology\\nii) The target area is thoroughly palpated  and the firmest\\nportion of the lesion or mass delineated.\\niii) The skin is cleaned  with an alcohol pad.\\niv) The mass is fixed  by the palpating hand of the operator\\nor by an assistant; gloves may be used for protection of theoperator and the assistant.\\nv) The needle is inserted  into the target area. On reaching\\nthe lesion, the plunger of the syringe is retracted and at least\\n10 ml of suction applied while moving the needle back andforth within the lesion; the direction or angle of the needlemay be changed to access different areas of the lesion.\\nvi) Aspiration is terminated  when aspirated material or blood\\nbecomes visible at the base or hub of the needle. For\\ndiagnostic purposes, cellular material contained within theneedle is more than adequate; material drawn into the barrelof the syringe is not recovered since it is of no use for cytologicdiagnosis.\\nvii) On completion of aspiration, suction is released  and\\npressure within the syringe allowed to equalise before\\nwithdrawing the needle. Withdrawing the needle withnegative pressure or suction results in blood being aspiratedand cellular material being sucked into the barrel of thesyringe, thus lost to interpretation.Figure 11.11 Procedure for FNAC of palpable masses. Needle is\\nintroduced into the mass (A). Plunger is retracted after needle enters the\\nmass (B). Suction is maintained while needle is moved back and forthwithin the mass (C). Suction is released and plunger returned to originalposition before needle is withdrawn (D).viii) Following withdrawal of the needle from the lesion,\\npressure  is applied to the site of puncture by the assistant or\\npatient himself for 2 to 3 minutes in order to arrest bleedingand prevent haematoma formation.\\nix) Aspirated material is recovered  by detaching the needle\\nfrom the syringe and filling the syringe with air; the syringe\\nand needle are then reconnected and the aspirate expressedonto one end of a glass slide.\\nPreparation of Smears\\nPreparation of smears is crucial to the success of FNAC.\\nPoorly-prepared smears with distorted cellular morphologywill frustrate the best efforts of the most competentcytopathologist, and often result in errors of interpretationor in failure to arrive at any specific diagnosis. The procedureconsists of the following steps (Fig. 11.12):\\ni) Aspirates deposited on the slide are inspected  with the\\nnaked eye.\\nii) Semisolid particulate aspirates are crush-smeared  by flat\\npressure with a glass slide or a thick coverslip. Even and\\ngentle pressure is required to avoid traumatising cells.Droplets of fluid or bloody material are gathered under theedge of the angled smearing slide or coverslip and pulledlike a blood smear. Particulate material, which collects alongthe edges and at the end of the smear, is then crush-smearedby flattening the smearing slide.\\niii) Prepared smears are either wet-fixed  or air-dried.  Half the\\nnumber of smears are immediately immersed in 95% ethanol,\\ntransported to the laboratory in the fixative, and used forPapanicolaou or H&E staining. The remaining smears areair-dried, wrapped in tissue paper for transport to the labo-ratory, and stained by Romanowsky stains (e.g. Leishman’s,May-Grünwald-Giemsa). Most cytopathologists use bothwet-fixed and air-dried smears—the wet-fixed smearsprovide excellent nuclear detail while the air-dried smearsyields information about the cytoplasm and the background.The general properties of wet-fixed and air-dried smearsoutlined in Table 11.8.\\nSpecial and Ancillary S\\ntudies\\nAspirates may also be studied by special stains and tech-niques for specific purposes as under:\\nFigure 11.12 Preparation of smears. Semisolid aspirates are crush-smeared by flat pressure with cover slip or glass slide (A). Fluid or bloo d\\ndroplet is collected along edge of spreader (B), and pulled as for peripheral blood films (C). Particles at the end of the smear are crush-smeared (D).\\n280SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\ni) SPECIAL STAINS. Wet-fixed smears are used for a\\nvariety of special stains such as Alcian blue, mucicarmine\\nand PAS (for mucin and carbohydrates); methyl violet orcongo red (for amyloid); and bacterial and fungal stains (formicrobial agents).\\nii) MICROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES.  Aspirates may also be\\nsubmitted for viral, fungal, mycobacterial and bacterial\\nculture. When infection is suspected, an additional aspirateis obtained and expressed into a sterile culture tube. Ifadditional aspiration is not feasible, the needle is flushed withsterile isotonic saline or foetal calf serum and the rinsed fluidsubmitted for microbial culture.\\niii) CELL BLOCK. Aspirated material may be processed as\\nsurgical pathology material by preparing paraffin blocks\\nfrom cell button of the centrifuged deposit. Sections providerecognition of histologic patterns and can also be used forancillary techniques.\\niv) IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL STUDIES.  The smears or\\ncell block sections can be further evaluated by immuno-\\ncytochemical stains by employing panel of antibodiesselected on the basis of differential diagnosis made afterroutine morphologic examination of smears.\\nv) IMAGE ANALYSIS AND MORPHOMETRY. These\\ntechniques when applied to cytological smears bring\\nquantitation and objectivity to cytodiagnosis. They determinethe cellular parameters like N/C ratio, nuclear area, shapeand size of nuclei and nucleoli etc.\\nvi) FLOW CYTOMETRY. Determination of ploidy status and\\nS phase fraction of tumour cells using flow cytometry\\nenhances the diagnostic and prognostic information availableon routine cytology.\\nvii) ULTRASTRUCTURAL STUDIES.  Aspirates obtained\\nby FNAC are also suitable for electron microscopy (both TEM\\nand SEM).\\nviii) MOLECULAR BIOLOGIC TECHNIQUES. These\\ntechniques are now being widely applied to cytopathology\\nalso. Detection of  oncogenes like ERBB-2  in breast cancer,\\nBCL-2  in lymphomas, DNA sequence analysis, gene\\nexpression profiling and fluorescence in situ hybridisation\\n(FISH) can all be used for aspiration samples.\\nAspiration of Specific Lesions/Body Sites\\nIn addition to the general procedure for FNAC described\\nabove, aspiration from certain specific sites/lesionsrequire greater expertise and additional material asoutlined below.\\ni) CYSTS.  Cysts of the neck, thyroid, breast and other sites\\nare often encountered during FNAC. During aspiration, the\\nentire fluid content is evacuated by drawing into the syringeand collected in test tube for centrifugation and smearpreparation. If a residual mass is palpable after removal offluid, a fresh syringe is used for additional aspiration of themass in the usual manner.\\nii) THYROID.  Lesions of the thyroid are aspirated with the\\npatient either sitting up or lying supine with the neck\\nextended. Solitary nodules are fixed between two palpatingfingers, while a diffusely enlarged lobe is fixed by askingthe patient to swallow and applying two fingers to the baseof the lobe to hold it against the trachea. The patient is askedto avoid swallowing during aspiration. Subsequently, firmpressure is applied to the puncture site for about 3 minutesto prevent haematoma formation.\\niii) LUNG AND RETROPERITONEUM.  FNAC of these two\\nsites is usually carried out under the guidance of radiological\\nimaging techniques. Local anaesthesia (1% xylocaine) isadvisable with infiltration of skin and deeper tissues. Spinalpuncture needles (22 or 20 gauge) are used. Since these longneedles are flexible they are rotated during insertion to enablean accurate approach to the target lesion.\\niv) PROSTATE.  The prostate is sampled transrectally during\\nper-rectal examination with the patient in lithotomy position.\\nA custom-made or commercially available needle guide (suchas the Franzen needle guide) may be used. Alternatively, a16 gauge blunt-tipped venous cannula may serve as a needleguide. The cannula is taped to the index finger of the glovedhand with its tip just proximal to the pulp of the index-finger,and a fingercot drawn over it. The prostatic lesion is palpatedwith the pulp of the finger and sampled by puncturingthrough the fingercot with a long 22 gauge needle introduced\\nthrough the cannula.\\nv\\n) TESTIS.  Local anaesthesia is advisable when FNAC of\\nthe testis is carried out for infertility as pain may beconsiderable when suction is applied. Spermatic cord blockis employed for the purpose. Infiltration of scrotal skin isnot required. For suspected testicular tumours, localanaesthesia is not required; however, thinner needles (25 or24 gauge) are advocated by some workers to avoid seeding\\nof tumour along the needle track.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 11.8: General Properties of Wet-Fixed and Air-Dried Smears.\\nFeature Wet-fixed Air-dried\\n1.

FNA of the para-\\numbilical abdominal adipose tissue is currently accepted\\nmethod for diagnosis of secondary systemic amyloidosis.\\nAmyloid is demonstrated as rings around fat cells by the\\nconvention al Congo red staining (congophilia) and apple-\\ngreen birefringence when viewed under polarising\\nmicroscopy.\\nRadiological Imaging Aids for FNAC\\nNon-palpable lesions require some form of localisation by\\nradiological aids for FNAC to be carried out. Plain X-ray films\\nare usually adequate for lesions within bones and for somelesions within the chest. FNAC of the chest may also beattempted under image amplified fluoroscopy  which allows\\nvisualisation of needle placement on the television monitor.Computerised tomographic-(CT)  guidance  is also used for lesions\\nwithin the chest and abdomen. The most versatileradiological aid is ultrasonographic (US)-guidance which allows\\ndirect visualisation of needle placement in real time and isfree from radiation hazards. It is an extremely valuable aidfor FNAC of thyroid nodules, soft tissue masses, intra-abdo-minal lesions and for intrathoracic lesions which abut thechest wall, but is of no help in deep intrathoracic lesions orin bony lesions.\\nD\\n. COMPLICATIONS AND HAZARDS OF FNAC\\nFNAC is associated with relatively few complications.\\nPossible hazards and more commonly encountered\\ncomplications are as follows:\\n1. Haematomas.  Bleeding from the puncture site and\\nhaematoma formation are the commonest complications of\\nthe procedure, particularly in the breast and the thyroid. Firmfinger pressure for 2 to 3 minutes immediately after theprocedure greatly reduces the frequency of thesecomplications.\\n2. Infection.  Introduction of infection is not a significant\\nhazard; even transabdominal aspiration does not result in\\nperitoneal contamination despite puncture of bowel walls.Transrectal aspiration in cases of acute prostatitis may,however, result in bacteraemia and septicaemia.\\n3. Pneumothorax.  Transcutaneous aspiration of the lung\\ncauses pneumothorax in about 20% of cases; most resolve\\nspontaneously although intercostal intubation may berequired in some instances. Transient haemoptysis may alsobe associated with lung aspiration.\\n4. Dissemination of tumour.  Generalised dissemination of\\nmalignant cells via lymphatics and blood vessels following\\nFNAC is a theoretical possibility but no definite instanceshave been recorded. Local dissemination by seeding ofmalignant cells along the needle tract is a rare complicationand has been reported in cancers of the lung, prostate andpancreas. Aspiration of malignant ovarian cysts may resultin release of cyst contents into the peritoneal cavity withperitoneal implants.E. PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS OF FNAC\\nWhile FNAC is generally a safe procedure, precautions have\\nto be taken when aspiration is contemplated of some sitesunder certain circumstances:\\n1. Bleeding disorders.  Thrombocytopenia per se  is not a\\ncontraindication to FNAC. In patients with coagulopathies\\nsuch as haemophilia, aspiration of joint spaces, chest andabdominal viscera is contraindicated; superficial lesions maybe aspirated and pressure applied to the puncture site for atleast 5 minutes following the procedure.\\n2. Liver.  Estimation of prothrombin time is an essential pre-\\nrequisite for aspiration of the liver. FNAC is not advisable if\\nprothrombin index (PTI) is less than 80%. Obstructivejaundice is a relative contraindication for FNAC on accountof the risk of bile peritonitis.\\n3. Lung.  FNAC of the lung should not be undertaken in\\nelderly patients with emphysema or pulmonary hyper-\\ntension because of the enhanced risk of pneumothorax andhaemoptysis respectively.\\n4. Pancreas.  FNAC is contraindicated in acute pancreatitis\\nas it aggravates the inflammatory process.5. Prostate.  Transrectal aspiration in acute prostatitis may\\ncause bacteraemia/septicaemia and is contraindicated.6. Testis.  Aspiration is extremely painful in acute\\nepididymo-orchitis and should be deferred till such time the\\nacute inflammatory process subsides. The patient is treatedwith anti-inflammatory agents and antibiotics and FNACundertaken at a later date.\\n7. Adrenal.  FNAC of a suspected pheochromocytoma is\\ninadvisable as it may sometimes provoke extreme fluctua-\\ntions in blood pressure.\\nF. CYTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS\\nThe cytopathologist can render a preliminary diagnosis\\nwithin one hour after the FNAC procedure when urgentlyrequired. Basic cytologic features in FNAC are similar tothose in histopathology but smear cytology depends uponthe technique for smear and stains employed. Emphasis inFNA cytology is on pattern recognition or arrangement ofcells, nuclear and cytoplasmic features of individual cells orgroups of cells, and comment on the backgroundmorphology.\\nUnderstandably, it is beyond the scope of this book to\\ndelve into morphological details of various lesions which canbe sampled by FNAC; interested readers in this subject arereferred to the specialised texts listed at the end of the book.However, a few common and classical examples of FNACapplications in lymph node (tuberculous lymphadenitis,Fig. 11.13 ), thyroid (follicular neoplasm, Fig. 11.14 ), breast\\n(fibroadenoma and infiltrating carcinoma, Figs. 11.15 and\\n11.16 ), abdominal fat (for amyloid, Fig. 11.17 ) and cell-block\\npreparation along with immunocytochemistry (Fig. 11.18)\\nare illustrated.282SECTION I General Pathology and Basic Techniques\\nFigure 11.13 FNA lymph node showing tuberculous lymphadenitis.\\nInbox shows Ziehl-Neelsen staining having many tubercle bacilli.Figure 11.14 FNA thyroid showing follicular neoplasm.\\nFigure 11.15 FNA breast lump showing features of fibroadenoma.

B, Same cellblock, stained with cytokeratin for\\nepithelial cells.\\n283CHAPTER 11 Basic Diagnostic CytologyG. LIMITATIONS OF FNAC\\nThe main limitation of FNAC lies in the fact that only a small\\npopulation of cells is sampled by the procedure. Thereliability of the test, thus, depends upon the adequacy ofthe sample and its representative character. An inadequatesample which is not representative of the true lesion resultsin a ‘false-negative’ diagnosis. If the FNAC report is‘negative’ despite a strong clinical suspicion of malignancy,the patient should be investigated further. FNAC may berepeated or a surgical biopsy performed to obtain a tissuediagnosis in such instances.\\nLack of requisite clinical information (e.g. size, site and\\ncharacter of mass) or relevant investigative results (e.g. X-ray findings) further limit the utility of FNAC. Knowledgeof the exact site from where the aspirate has been obtainedis crucial to the accurate interpretation of FNAC smears andlack of this information severely compromises the ability ofthe cytopathologist to provide a diagnosis.\\nII. IMPRINT CYTOLOGY\\nIn imprint cytology, touch preparations from cut surfaces of\\nfresh unfixed surgically excised mass lesions are examined.Imprints may also be obtained from draining sinuses orulcerated areas.\\nFor surgically resected specimens (e.g. lymph nodes)\\nsmears are prepared by bisecting or slicing the specimen andlightly touching or pressing a glass slide onto the freshlyexposed surface without smearing it. Smears cannot beprepared from fixed specimens. Smears are wet-fixed or air-dried and stained as per routine.\\nThe main advantage of the imprint smear is that the cell\\ndistribution reflects, and to some extent, recapitulates tissuearchitecture thus aiding in interpretation. The technique isused in the intraoperative diagnosis of malignancy as acomplement to frozen-section, and is also valuable as anadjunct to histopathology in the typing of lymphomas.\\nIII. CRUSH SMEAR CYTOLOGY\\nCrush smear preparations of tissue particles obtained by\\ncraniotomy have been used in the diagnosis of brain tumours.These smears are preferred by many workers as they allowrecognition of tissue architecture to some degree, in additionto better cytological details.\\nIV. BIOPSY SEDIMENT CYTOLOGY\\nBiopsy sediment cytology entails the examination of\\nsediment obtained by centrifugation of fixatives/fluids inwhich surgical biopsy specimens are despatched to thelaboratory. The method may be useful in the rapid diagnosisof bone tumours as histological sections are usually obtainedafter many days on account of the delay necessitated bydecalcification. For soft tissue specimens, the technique offersno particular advantage.\\nIn conclusion, both exfoliative cytology and FNA\\ncytology have now become a part of diagnostic pathology.It is imperative for the student in pathology as well as theclinician to be familiar with the advantages and limitationsof cytologic diagnosis. It is acknowledged that a markeddecline in incidence of cervical cancer in developed countriesis attributable to highly successful preventive Pap smearscreening programme. Similarly, large number of surgicaldiagnostic procedures are now avoided by rational use of\\nFNAC. However, in view of unique responsibility of\\npathologist in patient management, reporting cyto-pathologist should be adequately trained in the skill andshould not hesitate to ask for ancillary diagnostic techniques,or advise the use of core biopsy or open biopsy, whereverappropriate.\\n❑284SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nIntroduction to Haematopoietic\\nSystem and Disorders of\\nErythroid SeriesChapter 12Chapter 12\\nThe section on disorders of the haematopoietic system is\\nconcerned with diseases of the blood and the bone marrow.Conventionally, it includes study of constituents ofcirculating blood and thus comprises of discussion ondiseases of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets andbleeding disorders, and an account of blood groups andblood transfusion. However, with wide acceptance of thenewer WHO classification of malignancies of haematopoieticsystem and lymphoreticular tissues over previous FAB(French-American-British) Cooperative Group classification,this section needed rational redistribution. While the FABgroup had taken the criteria of location of leucocytes (in bloodand in tissues) for classification, the WHO classification hastaken into consideration both ‘circulating’ leucocytes and‘fixed’ leucocytes present anywhere in the tissues togethersince these diseases tend to disseminate from one pool tothe other.\\nThus, in this edition, the present chapter encompasses\\nbasic introduction to the haematopoietic system and the bonemarrow, followed by discussion on erythroid series ofdisorders. The disorders of leucocytes (myeloid andlymphoid series) and diseases of lymphoreticular tissueshave been put together in Chapter 14. A separate chapter ondisorders of platelets and bleeding along with transfusionmedicine (Chapter 13) has been placed interposed betweenthese two chapters.\\nSince study of haematopoietic system involves two\\nphases—laboratory haematology and clinical haematology,understanding of broad principles of management ofcommon haematological diseases has been considereddesirable part of the discussion on these topics.\\nBONE MARROW\\nThe pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow give rise totwo types of multipotent stem cells: non-lymphoid stem cells\\nwhich differentiate in the bone marrow, and lymphoid stem\\ncells which differentiate in the bone marrow and then migrateto the lymphoid tissues. The non-lymphoid stem cells formthe circulating erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes andplatelets. Monocytes on entering the tissues form a varietyof phagocytic macrophages, both of which together constitutemononuclear-phagocyte system (Chapter 4). Lymphopoieticcells in the marrow undergo differentiation to form B, T andnatural killer (NK) cells of the immune system.\\nCirculating blood normally contains 3 main types of\\nmature cells—the red cells (erythrocytes), the white cells(leucocytes) and the platelets (thrombocytes). These bloodcells perform their respective physiologic functions:erythrocytes  are largely concerned with oxygen transport,\\nleucocytes  play various roles in body defense against infection\\nand tissue injury, while  thrombocytes  are primarily involved\\nin maintaining integrity of blood vessels and in preventingblood loss. The lifespan of these cells in circulating blood isvariable—neutrophils have a lifespan of 6-8 hours, followedby platelets with a lifepan of 10 days, while the RBCs havethe longest lifespan of 90-120 days. The rates of productionof these blood cells are normally regulated in healthyindividuals in such a way so as to match the rate at whichthey are lost from circulation. Their concentration is normallymaintained within well-defined limits unless the balance isdisturbed due to some pathologic processes.\\nHAEMATOPOIESIS\\nIn the human embryo, the yolk sac  is the main site of\\nhaematopoiesis in the first few weeks of gestation. By about\\n3rd month, however, the liver and spleen  are the main sites of\\nblood cell formation and continue to do so until about 2 weeksafter birth. Haematopoiesis commences in the bone marrow\\nby 4th and 5th month and becomes fully active by 7th and8th month so that at birth practically all the bones containactive marrow. During normal childhood and adult life,therefore, the marrow is the only source of new blood cells.However, during childhood, there is progressive fattyreplacement throughout the long bones so that by adult lifethe haematopoietic marrow is confined to the central skele-ton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull, sacrum and pelvis) andproximal ends of femur, tibia and humerus (Fig.\\xa012.1).  Even\\nin these haematopoietic areas, about 50% of the marrowconsists of fat (Fig.\\xa012.2).\\xa0 Non-haematopoietic marrow in the\\nadult is, however, capable of reverting to active haemato-\\nSection II HAEMATOLOGY AND\\nLYMPHORETICULAR TISSUES285CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\npoiesis in certain pathologic conditions. The spleen and liver\\ncan also resume their foetal haematopoietic role in certainpathologic conditions and is called extramedullary\\nhaematopoiesis.\\nIn the bone marrow, developing blood cells are situated\\noutside the marrow sinuses, from where after maturationthey enter the marrow sinuses, the marrow microcirculationand thence released into circulation.\\nHAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS\\nHaematopoieisis involves two stages: mitotic division or\\nproliferation, and differentiation or maturation.\\nIt is widely accepted that blood cells develop from a small\\npopulation of common multipotent haematopoietic stemcells. The stem cells express a variety of cell surface proteinssuch as CD34 and adhesion proteins which help the stemcells to “home” to the bone marrow when infused. The stemcells have the appearance of small or intermediate-sizedlymphocytes and their presence in the marrow can bedemonstrated by cell culture techniques by the growth ofcolony-forming units (CFU) pertaining to different cell lines.The stem cells have the capability of maintaining theirprogeny by self-replication. The bone marrow provides asuitable environment for growth and development of stemcells. For instance, if haematopoietic stem cells are infusedintravenously into a suitably-prepared recipient, they seedthe marrow successfully but do not thrive at other sites. Thisprinciple forms the basis of bone marrow (or stem cell) trans-plantation performed for various haematologic diseases.The stem cells, after a series of divisions, differentiate into\\ntwo types of progenitors— lymphoid  (immune system) stem\\ncells, and non-lymphoid or myeloid  (trilineage) stem cells. The\\nformer develop into T, B and NK cells while the latterdifferentiate into 3 types of cell lines—granulocyte-monocyteprogenitors (producing neutrophils, eosinophils, basophilsand monocytes), erythroid progenitors (producing red cells),and megakaryocytes (as the source of platelets). The develop-ment of mature cells (i.e. poiesis )—red cells (erythropoiesis),\\ngranulocytes (granulopoiesis), monocytes, lymphocytes(lymphopoiesis) and platelets (thrombopoiesis) areconsidered in detail later in relevant sections.\\nMyeloid haematopoiesis or myelopoiesis includes\\ndifferentiation and maturation of granulocytes, monocytes,\\nerythroid cells and megakaryocytes (Fig.\\xa012.3).\\xa0 The\\ndifferentiation and maturation of each series of these cells\\nfrom stem cells are regulated by endogenous glycoproteins\\ncalled as growth factors, cytokines and hormones.  These are as\\nunder:\\nErythropoietin\\nGranulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)\\nGranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-\\nCSF)\\nThrombopoietinEach of these growth factors acts on specific receptors\\nfor growth factor to initiate further cell events as shown\\nschematically in Fig. 12.3.\\nBONE MARROW EXAMINA TION\\nExamination of the bone marrow provides an invaluable\\ndiagnostic help in some cases, while in others it is of value inconfirming a diagnosis suspected on clinical examination or\\non the blood film. A peripheral blood smear examination,\\nhowever, must always precede bone marrow examination.Figure 12.1 Sites of haematopoiesis in the bone marrow in the\\nadult.Figure 12.2 A normal bone marrow in an adult as seen in a section\\nafter trephine biopsy. Bony trabeculae support the marrow-containing\\ntissue. Approximately 50% of the soft tissue of the bone consists ofhaematopoietic tissue and 50% is fatty marrow.\\n286SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nFigure 12.3 Schematic representation of differentiation of multipotent stem cells into blood cells.\\nBone marrow examination may be performed by two\\nmethods— aspiration and trephine biopsy.  A comparison of the\\ntwo methods is summarised in Table 12.1.\\nBONE MARROW ASPIRATION.  The method involves\\nsuction of marrow via a strong, wide bore, short-bevelled\\nneedle fitted with a stylet and an adjustable guard in order\\nto prevent excessive penetration; for instance Salah bonemarrow aspiration needle (Fig. 12.4,A).  Smears are prepared\\nimmediately from the bone marrow aspirate and are fixedin 95% methanol after air-drying. The usual Romanowskytechnique is employed for s taining and a stain for iron is\\nperformed routinely so as to assess the reticuloendothelialstores of iron.\\nThe marrow film provides assessment of cellularity,\\ndetails of developing blood cells (i.e. normoblastic ormegaloblastic, myeloid, lymphoid, macrophages andmegakaryocytic), ratio between erythroid and myeloid cells,storage diseases, and for the presence of cells foreign to themarrow such as secondary carcinoma, granulomatousconditions, fungi (e.g. histoplasmosis) and parasites (e.g.\\nmalaria, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis). \\xa0Estimation of the\\nproportion of cellular components in the marrow, however,\\ncan be provided by doing a differential count of at least 500\\ncells (myelogram, Table12.2 ). In some conditions, the\\nmarrow cells can be used for more detailed special tests such\\nas cytogenetics, microbiological culture, biochemicalanalysis, and immunological and cytological markers.\\nTREPHINE BIOPSY.  Trephine biopsy is performed by a\\nsimple Jamshidi trephine needle  by which a core of tissue from\\nperiosteum to bone marrow cavity is obtained (Fig.\\xa012.4,B).\\nThe tissue is then fixed, soft decalcified and processed for\\nhistological sections and stained with haematoxylin andeosin and for reticulin. Trephine biospy is useful over\\naspiration since it provides an excellent view of the overall\\nmarrow architecture, cellularity, and presence or absence ofinfiltrates, but is less valuable than aspiration as far asindividual cell morphology is concerned.\\n287CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\nRED BLOOD CELLS\\nERYTHROPOIESIS\\nAlthough the stem cells which eventually form the mature\\nerythrocytes of the peripheral blood cannot be recognisedmorphologically, there is a well-defined and readilyrecognisable lineage of nucleated red cells (i.e. the erythroidseries) in the marrow.\\nErythroid Series\\nThe cells in this series are as under (Fig. 12.5):\\n1. PROERYTHROBLAST.  The earliest recognisable cell in\\nthe marrow is a proerythroblast or pronormoblast. It is a largecell, 15-20 μ m in diameter having deeply basophilic\\ncytoplasm and a large central nucleus containing nucleoli.\\nThe deep blue colour of the cytoplasm is due to high contentof RNA which is associated with active protein synthesis.\\nAs the cells mature, the nuclei lose their nucleoli and become\\nsmaller and denser, while the cytoplasm on maturation leadsto replacement of dense blue colour progressively by pink-staining haemoglobin. Each proerythroblast undergoes 4-5\\nreplications and forms 16-32 mature RBCs.\\n2. BASOPHILIC (EARLY) ERYTHROBLAST.  It is a round\\ncell having a diameter of 12-16 μm with a large nucleus which\\nis slightly more condensed than the proerythroblast and\\ncontains basophilic cytoplasm. Basophilic erythroblast\\nundergoes rapid proliferation.\\n3.\\nPOLYCHROMATIC(INTERMEDIATE) ERYTHRO-\\nBLAST.  Next maturation stage has a diameter of 12-14 μm.\\nThe nucleus at this stage is coarse and deeply basophilic.\\nThe cytoplasm is characteristically polychromatic i.e.contains admixture of basophilic RNA and acidophilichaemoglobin. The cell at this stage ceases to undergo\\nproliferative activity.\\n4. ORTHOCHROMATIC (LATE) ERYTHROBLAST.  The\\nfinal stage in the maturation of nucleated red cells is the\\northochromatic  or late erythroblast. The cell at this stage is\\nsmaller, 8-12 μm in diameter, containing a small and pyknotic\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 12.2: Normal Adult Bone Marrow Counts (Myelogram).\\nFat/cell ratio : 50:50\\nMyeloid/erythroid (M/E) ratio : 2-4:1 (mean 3:1)Myeloid series: 30-45% (37.5%)• Myeloblasts : 0.1-3.5%• Promyelocytes: 0.5-5%Erythroid series: 10-15% (mean 12.5%)Megakaryocytes: 0.5%Lymphocytes: 5-20%Plasma cells: \\n< 3%\\nReticulum cells: 0.1-2%\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 12.1: Comparison of Bone Marrow Aspiration and Trephine Biopsy.\\nFeature Aspiration Trephine\\n1.

The cytoplasm is\\ncharacteristically acidophilic with diffuse basophilic hue dueto the presence of large amounts of haemoglobin.\\n5. RETICULOCYTE.  The nucleus is finally extruded from\\nthe late erythroblast within the marrow and a reticulocyte\\nresults. The reticulocytes are juvenile red cells devoid ofnuclei but contain ribosomal RNA so that they are still able\\nto synthesise haemoglobin. A reticulocyte spends 1-2 days\\nin the marrow and circulates for 1-2 days in the peripheralblood before maturing in the spleen, to become a biconcavered cell. The reticulocytes in the peripheral blood are distin-\\nguished from mature red cells by slightly basophilic hue in\\nthe cytoplasm similar to that of an orthochromaticerythroblast. Reticulocytes can be counted in the laboratoryby vital staining  with dyes such as new methylene blue or\\nbrilliant cresyl blue. The reticulocytes by either of thesestaining methods contain deep blue reticulofilamentousmaterial \\xa0(Fig.\\xa012.6).  While erythroblasts are not normally\\npresent in human peripheral blood, reticulocytes are foundnormally in the peripheral blood. Normal range of\\nreticulocyte count in health is 0.5-2.5% in adults and 2-6% in\\ninfants. Their percentage in the peripheral blood is a fairlyaccurate reflection of erythropoietic activity. Their proportionis increased in conditions of rapid red cell regeneration e.g.\\nafter haemorrhage, haemolysis and haematopoietic response\\nof anaemia to treatment.Erythropoietin\\nErythropoietic activity in the body is regulated by the\\nhormone, erythropoietin, which is produced in response toanoxia. The principal site of erythropoietin production is the\\nkidney though there is evidence of its extra-renal production\\nin certain unusual circumstances. Its levels are, therefore,lowered in chronic renal diseases, while a case of renal cellcarcinoma may be associated with its increased production\\nand erythrocytosis. Erythropoietin acts on the marrow at the\\nvarious stages of morphologically unidentifiable as well asidentifiable erythroid precursors.\\nThere is an increased production of erythropoietin in\\nvarious types of anaemias but in anaemia of chronic diseases(e.g. in infections and neoplastic conditions) there is no suchenhancement of erythropoietin. In polycythaemia rubra vera,there is erythrocytosis but depressed production of\\nerythropoietin. This is because of an abnormality of the stem\\ncell class which is not under erythropoietin control.\\nImmunoassay of erythropoietin in plasma or serum can\\nbe done by sensitive techniques (ELISA and radio-immunoassay) due to its quite low values; normal values\\nare 10-25 U/L.\\nThe Red Cell\\nThe mature erythrocytes of the human peripheral blood are\\nnon-nucleated cells and lack the usual cell organelles. The\\nnormal human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7.2 μm in\\ndiameter, and has a thickness of 2.4 μm at the periphery and\\n1 μm in the centre. The biconcave shape renders the red cells\\nquite flexible so that they can pass through capillaries whoseminimum diameter is 3.5 μm. More than 90% of the weight\\nof erythrocyte consist of haemoglobin. The lifespan of red\\ncells is 120 \\n+ 30 days.\\nNORMAL VALUES AND RED CELL INDICES.  Range of\\nnormal red cell  count in health is 5.5 ± 1.0 × 1012/L in men\\nand 4.8 ± 1.0 × 1012/L in women. The packed cell volume (PCV)\\nor haematocrit  is the volume of erythrocytes per litre of whole\\nblood indicating the proportion of plasma and red cells andranges 0.47 ± 0.07 L/L (40-54%) in men and 0.42 ± 0.05 L/L(37-47%) in women. The haemoglobin content  in health is 15.5\\n± 2.5 g/dl (13-18 g/dl) in men and 14.0 ± 2.5 g/dl (11.5-16.5\\ng/dl) in women. Based on these normal values, a series ofabsolute values  or red cell indices can be derived which have\\ndiagnostic importance. These are as under:Figure 12.5 The erythroid series. There is progressive condensation of the nuclear chromatin which is eventually extruded from the cell at the\\nlate erythroblast stage. The cytoplasm contains progressively less RNA and more haemoglobin.\\nFigure 12.6 Reticulocytes in blood as seen in blood stained by\\nsupravital dye, new methylene blue.\\n289CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series1.

It is low in iron deficiency anaemiabut is usually normal in acrostic anaemia.\\nRED CELL MEMBRANE.  The red cell membrane is a\\ntrilaminar structure having a bimolecular lipid layer\\ninterposed between two layers of proteins. The importantproteins  in red cell membrane are band 3 protein (named on\\nthe basis of the order in which it migrates duringelectrophoresis), glycophorin and spectrin; important lipids\\nare glycolipids, phospholipids and cholesterol; and\\ncarbohydrates  form skeleton of erythrocytes having a lattice-\\nlike network which is attached to the internal surface of the\\nmembrane and is responsible for biconcave form of theerythrocytes.\\nA number of inherited disorders of the red cell membrane\\nand cytoskeletal components produce abnormalities of theshape such as: spherocytosis  (spherical shape from loss of part\\nof the membrane), ovalocytosis  (oval shape from loss of\\nelasticity of cytoskeleton), echinocytosis (spiny processes from\\nexternal surface due to metabolic abnormalities of red cells),and stomatocytosis  (bowl-shaped red cells from expansion of\\ninner membrane on one side).\\nNUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ERYTHRO-\\nPOIESIS.  New red cells are being produced each day for\\nwhich the marrow requires certain essential substances.\\nThese substances are as under:\\n1.Metals.  Iron is essential for red cell production because\\nit forms part of the haem molecule in haemoglobin. Its\\ndeficiency leads to iron deficiency anaemia. Cobalt andmanganese are certain other metals required for red cellproduction.\\n2. Vitamins.  Vitamin B\\n12 and folate are essential for bio-\\nsynthesis of nucleic acids. Deficiency of B12 or folate causes\\nmegaloblastic anaemia. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) plays an\\nindirect role by facilitating the iron turnover in the body.Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin E (tocopherol) and\\nriboflavin are the other essential vitamins required in thesynthesis of red cells.\\n3. Amino\\xa0acids.  Amino acids comprise the globin compo-\\nnent of haemoglobin. Severe amino acid deficiency due to\\nprotein deprivation causes depressed red cell production.\\n4. Hormones.  As discussed above, erythropoietin plays a\\nsignificant regulatory role in the erythropoietic activity.\\nBesides erythropoietin, androgens and thyroxine also appearto be involved in the red cell production.\\nHAEMOGLOBIN.  Haemoglobin consists of a basic protein,\\nglobin,  and the iron-porphyrin complex, haem.  The molecular\\nweight of haemoglobin is 68,000. Normal adult haemoglobin\\n(HbA ) constitutes 96-98% of the total haemoglobin content\\nand consists of four polypeptide chains, α\\n2β2. Small quantities\\nof 2 other haemoglobins present in adults are: HbF containing\\nα2γ2 globin chains comprising 0.5-0.8% of total haemoglobin,\\nand HbA2 having α2δ2 chains and constituting 1.5-3.2% of\\ntotal haemoglobin. Most of the haemoglobin (65%) issynthesised by the nucleated red cell precursors in themarrow, while the remainder (35%) is synthesised at thereticulocyte stage.\\nSynthesis of haem occurs largely in the mitochondria by\\na series of biochemical reactions summarised in Fig.\\xa012.7.\\nCoenzyme, pyridoxal-6-phosphate, derived from pyridoxine(vitamin B\\n6) is essential for the synthesis of amino levulinic\\nacid (ALA) which is the first step in the biosynthesis ofprotoporphyrin. The reaction is stimulated by erythropoietinand inhibited by haem. Ultimately, protoporphyrin combineswith iron supplied from circulating transferrin to form haem.Each molecule of haem combines with a globin chainsynthesised by polyribosomes. A tetramer of 4 globin chains,each having its own haem group, constitutes thehaemoglobin molecule (Fig. 12.8, A).\\nRED CELL  FUNCTIONS.  The essential function of the red\\ncells is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissue and totransport carbon dioxide to the lungs. In order to performthese functions, the red cells have the ability to generateenergy as ATP by anaerobic glycolytic pathway (Embden-Meyerhof pathway). This pathway also generates reducingpower as NADH and NADPH by the hexose monophosphate(HMP) shunt.\\n1.Oxygen carrying.  The normal adult haemoglobin, HbA,\\nis an extremely efficient oxygen-carrier. The four units of\\ntetramer of haemoglobin molecule take up oxygen insuccession, which, in turn, results in stepwise rise in affinityof haemoglobin for oxygen. This is responsible for the sigmoid\\nshape  of the oxygen dissociation curve.\\nThe oxygen affinity of haemoglobin is expressed in term\\nof P\\n50 value which is the oxygen tension (pO2) at which 50%\\nof the haemoglobin is saturated with oxygen. Pulmonarycapillaries have high pO\\n2 and, thus, there is virtual saturation\\nof available oxygen-combining sites of haemoglobin. Thetissue capillaries, however, have relatively low pO\\n2 and, thus,\\npart of haemoglobin is in deoxy state. The extent to whichoxygen is released from haemoglobin at pO\\n2, in tissue\\ncapillaries depends upon 3 factors—the nature of globin*For conversions, the multiples used are as follows: ‘deci (d) = 10–1, milli\\n(m) = 10–3, micro ( μ) = 10–6, nano (n) = 10–9, pico (p) = 10–12, femto (f) =\\n10–15290SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nchains, the pH, and the concentration of 2,3-\\nbiphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) as follows (Fig\\xa012.8,\\xa0B):\\nNormal adult haemoglobin (HbA) has lower affinity for\\noxygen  than foetal haemoglobin and, therefore, releases\\ngreater amount of bound oxygen at pO2 of tissue capillaries.\\nA fall in the pH  (acidic pH) lowers affinity of\\noxyhaemoglobin for oxygen, so called the Bohr effect, therebycausing enhanced release of oxygen from erythrocytes at thelower pH in tissue capillaries.\\nA rise in red cell concentration of 2,3-BPG,  an intermediate\\nproduct of Embden-Meyerhof pathway, as occurs in anaemiaand hypoxia, causes decreased affinity of HbA for oxygen.This, in turn, results in enhanced supply of oxygen to thetissue.2. CO\\n2\\xa0transport.  Another important function of the red cells\\nis the CO2 transport. In the tissue capillaries, the pCO2 is\\nhigh so that CO2 enters the erythrocytes where much of it is\\nconverted into bicarbonate ions which diffuse back into theplasma. In the pulmonary capillaries, the process is reversedand bicarbonate ions are converted back into CO\\n2. Some of\\nthe CO2 produced by tissues is bound to deoxyhaemoglobin\\nforming carbamino-haemoglobin. This compound dissociatesin the pulmonary capillaries to release CO\\n2.\\nRED CELL DESTRUCTION.  Red cells have a mean lifespan\\nof 120 days, after which red cell metabolism graduallydeteriorates as the enzymes are not replaced. The destroyedred cells are removed mainly by the macrophages of thereticuloendothelial (RE) system of the marrow, and to someFigure 12.7 Schematic diagram of haemoglobin synthesis in the developing red cell.\\nFigure 12.8 A, Normal adult haemoglobin molecule (HbA) consisting of α2 β2 globin chains, each with its own haem group in oxy and deoxy\\nstate.

B, Hb-dissociation curve. On dissociation of oxygen from Hb molecule i.e. on release\\nof oxygen to the tissues, salt bridges are formed again, and 2,3-BPG and CO2, are bound. The shift of the curve to higher oxygen delivery is affected\\nby acidic pH, increased 2,3-BPG and HbA molecule while oxygen delivery is less with high pH, low 2,3-BPG and HbF.\\n291CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Seriesextent by the macrophages in the liver and spleen (Fig.12.9).\\nThe breakdown of red cells liberates iron for recirculation\\nvia plasma transferrin to marrow erythroblasts, andprotoporphyrin which is broken down to bilirubin. Bilirubincirculates to the liver where it is conjugated to itsdiglucuronide which is excreted in the gut via bile andconverted to stercobilinogen and stercobilin excreted in thefaeces. Part of stercobilinogen and stercobilin is reabsorbedand excreted in the urine as urobilinogen and urobilin. Asmall fragment of protoporphyrin is converted to carbonmonoxide and excreted in expired air from the lungs. Globinchains are broken down to amino acids and reused for proteinsynthesis in the body.\\nANAEMIA—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nAnaemia is defined as a haemoglobin concentration in blood\\nbelow the lower limit of the normal range for the age andsex of the individual. In adults, the lower extreme of thenormal haemoglobin is taken as 13.0 g/dl for males and11.5 g/dl for females. Newborn infants have higherhaemoglobin level and, therefore, 15 g/dl is taken as thelower limit at birth, whereas at 3 months the normal lowerlevel is 9.5 g/dl. Although haemoglobin value is employedas the major parameter for determining whether or notanaemia is present, the red cell counts, haematocrit (PCV)and absolute values (MCV, MCH and MCHC) providealternate means of assessing anaemia.\\nPathophysiology of Anaemia\\nSubnormal level of haemoglobin causes lowered oxygen-\\ncarrying capacity of the blood. This, in turn, initiatescompensatory physiologic adaptations such as follows:\\nincreased release of oxygen from haemoglobin;\\nincreased blood flow to the tissues;\\nmaintenance of the blood volume; and\\nredistribution of blood flow to maintain the cerebral blood\\nsupply.\\nEventually, however, tissue hypoxia develops causing\\nimpaired functions of the affected tissues. The degree offunctional impairment of individual tissues is variabledepending upon their oxygen requirements. Tissues withhigh oxygen requirement such as the heart, CNS and theskeletal muscle during exercise, bear the brunt of clinicaleffects of anaemia.\\nClinical Features of Anaemia\\nThe haemoglobin level at which symptoms and signs of\\nanaemia develop depends upon 4 main factors:\\n1.The speed of onset of anaemia:  Rapidly progressive anaemia\\ncauses more symptoms than anaemia of slow-onset as there\\nis less time for physiologic adaptation.\\n2.The severity of anaemia:  Mild anaemia produces no\\nsymptoms or signs but a rapidly developing severe anaemia\\n(haemoglobin below 6.0 g/dl) may produce significantclinical features.\\n3.The age of the patient : The young patients due to good\\ncardiovascular compensation tolerate anaemia quite well as\\ncompared to the elderly. The elderly patients develop cardiacand cerebral symptoms more prominently due to associatedcardiovascular disease.\\n4.The haemoglobin dissociation curve:  In anaemia, the affinity\\nof haemoglobin for oxygen is depressed as 2,3-BPG in the\\nred cells increases. As a result, oxyhaemoglobin is dissociatedmore readily to release free oxygen for cellular use, causinga shift of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve to the right.\\nSYMPTOMS.  In symptomatic cases of anaemia, the\\npresenting features are: tiredness, easy fatiguability,\\ngeneralised muscular weakness, lethargy and headache. Inolder patients, there may be symptoms of cardiac failure,angina pectoris, intermittent claudication, confusion andvisual disturbances.\\nSIGNS.  A few general signs common to all types of anaemias\\nare as under:\\nFigure 12.9 Normal red cell destruction in the RE system.\\n292SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues1. Pallor.  Pallor is the most common and characteristic sign\\nwhich may be seen in the mucous membranes, conjunctivae\\nand skin.\\n2. Cardiovascular system.  A hyperdynamic circulation may\\nbe present with tachycardia, collapsing pulse, cardiomegaly,\\nmidsystolic flow murmur, dyspnoea on exertion, and in thecase of elderly, congestive heart failure.\\n3. Central nervous system.  The older patients may develop\\nsymptoms referable to the CNS such as attacks of faintness,\\ngiddiness, headache, tinnitus, drowsiness, numbness andtingling sensations of the hands and feet.\\n4. Ocular manifestations.  Retinal haemorrhages may occur\\nif there is associated vascular disease or bleeding diathesis.\\n5. Reproductivesystem.  Menstrual disturbances such as\\namenorrhoea and menorrhagia and loss of libido are some\\nof the manifestations involving the reproductive system inanaemic subjects.\\n6. Renal system.  Mild proteinuria and impaired concen-\\ntrating capacity of the kidney may occur in severe anaemia.\\n7. Gastrointestinalsystem.  Anorexia, flatulence, nausea,\\nconstipation and weight loss may occur.\\nIn addition to the general features, specific signs may be\\nassociated with particular types of anaemia which are\\ndescribed later together with discussion of specific types ofanaemias.\\nInvestigations of the Anaemic Subject\\nAfter obtaining the full medical history pertaining to different\\ngeneral and specific signs and symptoms, the patient isexamined for evidence of anaemia. Special emphasis is placedon colour of the skin, conjunctivae, sclerae and nails. Changesin the retina, atrophy of the papillae of the tongue, rectalexamination for evidence of bleeding, and presence ofhepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and bonytenderness are looked for.\\nIn order to confirm or deny the presence of anaemia, its\\ntype and its cause, the following plan of investigations isgenerally followed, of which complete blood counts (CBC)with reticulocyte count is the basic test.\\nA. HAEMOGLOBIN ESTIMATION.  The first and foremost\\ninvestigation in any suspected case of anaemia is to carry\\nout a haemoglobin estimation. Several methods are availablebut most reliable and accurate is the cyanmethaemoglobin(HiCN) method employing Drabkin’s solution and aspectrophotometer. If the haemoglobin value is below thelower limit of the normal range for particular age and sex,the patient is said to be anaemic. In pregnancy, there ishaemodilution and, therefore, the lower limit in normalpregnant women is less (10.5 g/dl) than in the non-pregnantstate.\\nB. PERIPHERALBLOOD FILM EXAMINATION.  The\\nhaemoglobin estimation is invariably followed by\\nexamination of a peripheral blood film for morphologicfeatures after staining it with the Romanowsky dyes (e.g.Leishman’s stain, May-Grünwald-Giemsa’s stain, Jenner-Giemsa’s stain, Wright’s stain etc). The blood smear isevaluated in an area where there is neither Rouleauxformation nor so thin as to cause red cell distortion. Such anarea can usually be found at junction of the body with thetail of the film, but not actually at the tail. The followingabnormalities in erythroid series of cells are particularlylooked for in a blood smear:\\n1. Variation in size (Anisocytosis).  Normally, there is slight\\nvariation in diameter of the red cells from 6.7-7.7 μm (mean\\nvalue 7.2 μm). Increased variation in size of the red cell is\\ntermed anisocytosis. Anisocytosis may be due to the presence\\nof cells larger than normal ( macrocytosis ) or cells smaller than\\nnormal ( microcytosis). Sometimes both microcytosis and\\nmacrocytosis are present ( dimorphic ).\\nMacrocytes  are classically found in megaloblastic anaemia;\\nother causes are aplastic anaemia, other dyserythropoieticanaemias, chronic liver disease and in conditions withincreased erythropoiesis.\\nMicrocytes  are present in iron deficiency anaemia,\\nthalassaemia and spherocytosis. They may also result fromfragmentation of erythrocytes such as in haemolytic anaemia.\\n2. Variation in shape (Poikilocytosis).  Increased variation\\nin shape of the red cells is termed poikilocytosis. The nature\\nof the abnormal shape determines the cause of anaemia.Poikilocytes are produced in various types of abnormalerythropoiesis e.g. in megaloblastic anaemia, iron deficiencyanaemia, thalassaemia, myelosclerosis and microangiopathichaemolytic anaemia.\\n3. Inadequate haemoglobin formation (Hypochromasia).\\nNormally, the intensity of pink staining of haemoglobin in a\\nRomanowsky-stained blood smear gradually decreases fromthe periphery to the centre of the cell. Increased central palloris referred to as hypochromasia . It may develop either from\\nlowered haemoglobin content (e.g. in iron deficiencyanaemia, chronic infections), or due to thinness of the redcells (e.g. in thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemia). Unusuallydeep pink staining of the red cells due to increased haemo-globin concentration is termed hyperchromasia  and may be\\nfound in megaloblastic anaemia, spherocytosis and inneonatal blood.\\n4. Compensatory erythropoiesis.  A number of changes are\\nassociated with compensatory increase in erythropoietic\\nactivity. These are as under:\\ni)Polychromasia  is defined as the red cells having more than\\none type of colour. Polychromatic red cells are slightly larger,\\ngenerally stained bluish-grey and represent reticulocytes and,thus, correlate well with reticulocyte count.\\nii)Erythroblastaemia  is the presence of nucleated red cells in\\nthe peripheral blood film. A small number of erythroblasts\\n(or normoblasts) may be normally found in cord blood atbirth. They are found in large numbers in haemolytic diseaseof the newborn, other haemolytic disorders and inextramedullary erythropoiesis. They may also appear in theblood in various types of severe anaemias except in aplasticanaemia. Erythroblastaemia may also occur aftersplenectomy.\\niii)Punctate basophilia or basophilic stippling  is diffuse and\\nuniform basophilic granularity in the cell which does not\\nstain positively with Perls’ reaction (in contrast to293CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\nPappenheimer bodies which stain positively). Classical\\npunctate basophilia is seen in aplastic anaemia, thalassaemia,myelodysplasia, infections and lead poisoning.\\niv)Howell-Jolly bodies  are purple nuclear remnants, usually\\nfound singly, and are larger than basophilic stippling. They\\nare present in megaloblastic anaemia and after splenectomy.\\n5. Miscellaneous\\xa0changes.  In addition to the morphologic\\nchanges of red cells described above, several other abnormal\\nred cells may be found in different haematological disorders.Some of these are as follows (Fig.\\xa012.10):\\ni)Spherocytosis  is characterised by presence of spheroidal\\nrather than biconcave disc-shaped red cells. Spherocytes areseen in hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune haemolyticanaemia and in ABO haemolytic disease of the newborn.\\nii)Schistocytosis  is identified by fragmentation of erythro-\\ncytes. Schistocytes are found in thalassaemia, hereditary\\nelliptocytosis, megaloblastic anaemia, iron deficiencyanaemia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and insevere burns.\\niii)Irregularly contracted red cells  are found in drug and\\nchemical induced haemolytic anaemia and in unstable\\nhaemoglobinopathies.\\niv)Leptocytosis  is the presence of unusually thin red cells.\\nLeptocytes are seen in severe iron deficiency and\\nthalassaemia. Target cell  is a form of leptocyte in which there\\nis central round stained area and a peripheral rim ofhaemoglobin. Target cells are found in iron deficiency,thalassaemia, chronic liver disease, and after splenectomy.\\nv)Sickle cells or drepanocytes  are sickle-shaped red cells found\\nin sickle cell disease.\\nvi)Crenated red cells  are the erythrocytes which develop\\nnumerous projections from the surface. They are present in\\nblood films due to alkaline pH, presence of traces of fattysubstances on the slides and in cases where the film is madefrom blood that has been allowed to stand overnight.vii)  Acanthocytosis  is the presence of coarsely crenated red\\ncells. Acanthocytes are found in large number in blood filmmade from splenectomised subjects, and in chronic liverdisease.\\nviii) Burr cells  are cell fragments having one or more spines.\\nThey are particularly found in uraemia.ix)Stomatocytosis  is the presence of stomatocytes which have\\ncentral area having slit-like or mouth-like appearance. They\\nare found in hereditary stomatocytosis, or may be seen inchronic alcoholism.\\nx)Ovalocytosis or elliptocytosis  is the oval or elliptical shape\\nof red cells. Their highest proportion (79%) is seen in\\nhereditary ovalocytosis and elliptocytosis; other conditionsshowing such abnormal shapes of red cells are megaloblasticanaemia and hypochromic anaemia.\\nC. RED CELL INDICES.  An alternative method to diagnose\\nand detect the severity of anaemia is by measuring the red\\ncell indices:\\nIn iron deficiency and thalassaemia, MCV, MCH and\\nMCHC are reduced.\\nIn anaemia due to acute blood loss and haemolytic\\nanaemias, MCV, MCH and MCHC are all within normallimits.\\nIn megaloblastic anaemias, MCV is raised above the\\nnormal range.\\nD. LEUCOCYTE AND PLATELET COUNT.  Measurement\\nof leucocyte and platelet count helps to distinguish pure\\nanaemia from pancytopenia in which red cells, granulocytesand platelets are all reduced. In anaemias due to haemolysisor haemorrhage, the neutrophil count and platelet countsare often elevated. In infections and leukaemias, the leucocytecounts are high and immature leucocytes appear in the blood.\\nE. RETICULOCYTE COUNT.  Reticulocyte count (normal\\n0.5-2.5%) is done in each case of anaemia to assess the marrowFigure 12.10 Some of the common morphologic abnormalities of red cells (The serial numbers in the illustrations correspond to the order in\\nwhich they are described in the text).\\n294SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissueserythropoietic activity. In acute haemorrhage and in\\nhaemolysis, the reticulocyte response is indicative ofimpaired marrow function.\\nF. ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE.  The ESR\\nis a non-specific test used as a screening test for anaemia. It\\nusually gives a clue to the underlying organic disease butanaemia itself may also cause rise in the ESR.\\nG. BONE MARROW EXAMINATION.  Bone marrow\\naspiration is done in cases where the cause for anaemia is\\nnot obvious. The procedures involved for marrow aspirationand trephine biopsy and their relative advantages anddisadvantages have already been discussed (page 285).\\nIn addition to these general tests, certain specific tests\\nare done in different types of anaemias which are describedlater under the discussion of specific anaemias.\\nClassification of Anaemias\\nSeveral types of classifications of anaemias have been\\nproposed. Two of the widely accepted classifications arebased on the pathophysiology and morphology (Table 12.3).\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION.  Depending\\nupon the pathophysiologic mechanism, anaemias areclassified into 3 groups:\\nI.Anaemia due to \\nblood loss.  This is further of 2 types:\\nA. Acute post-haemorrhagic anaemia\\nB. Anaemia of chronic blood loss\\nII. Anaemiadue to impaired red cell formation.  A\\ndisturbance due to impaired red cell production from various\\ncauses may produce anaemia. These are as under:A.Cytoplasmic maturation defects\\n1. Deficient haem synthesis: iron deficiency anaemia\\n2. Deficient globin synthesis: thalassaemic syndromes\\nB.Nuclear maturation defects\\nVitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency: megalo-\\nblastic anaemia\\nC.Haematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation\\nabnormality  e.g.\\n1. Aplastic anaemia2. Pure red cell aplasia\\nD.Bone marrow failure due to systemic diseases (anaemia of\\nchronic disorders) e.g.\\n1. Anaemia of inflammation/infections, disseminated\\nmalignancy\\n2.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia.The term hypoproliferative anaemias  is also used to denote\\nimpaired  marrow proliferative activity and includes 2 maingroups: hypoproliferation due to iron deficiency and that dueto other hypoproliferative disorders; the latter categoryincludes anaemia of chronic inflammation/infection, renaldisease, hypometabolic states, and causes of bone marrowfailure.\\nIII.\\xa0Anaemia\\xa0due\\xa0to\\xa0increased\\xa0red\\xa0cell\\xa0destruction\\xa0(haemo-\\nlytic\\xa0anaemias).  This is further divided into 2 groups:\\nA. Intracorpuscular defect (hereditary and acquired).B. Extracorpuscular defect (acquired haemolytic anaemias).\\nMORPHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION.  Based on the red cell\\nsize, haemoglobin content and red cell indices, anaemias are\\nclassified into 3 types:\\n1.Microcytic,\\xa0hypochromic:  MCV, MCH, MCHC are all\\nreduced e.g. in iron deficiency anaemia and in certain non-\\niron deficient anaemias (sideroblastic anaemia, thalassaemia,anaemia of chronic disorders).\\n2. Normocytic,\\xa0normochromic:  MCV, MCH, MCHC are all\\nnormal e.g. after acute blood loss, haemolytic anaemias, bone\\nmarrow failure, anaemia of chronic disorders.\\n3. Macrocytic:  MCV is raised e.g. in megaloblastic anaemia\\ndue to deficiency of vitamin B\\n12 or folic acid.\\nWith these general comments on anaemias, a discussion\\nof the specific types of anaemias is given in the following\\npages.\\nANAEMIA OF BLOOD LOSS\\nDepending upon the rate of blood loss due to haemorrhage,\\nthe effects of post-haemorrhagic anaemia appear.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 12.3: Classification of Anaemias.\\nA.

When the loss of blood occurs\\nsuddenly, the following events take place:\\ni)Immediate threat to life due to hypovolaemia which may\\nresult in shock and death.\\nii) If the patient survives, shifting of interstitial fluid to\\nintravascular compartment with consequent haemodilutionwith low haematocrit.\\niii) Hypoxia stimulates production of erythropoietin resul-\\nting in increased marrow erythropoiesis.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS\\ni) Normocytic and normochromic anaemia\\nii) Low haematocritiii) Increased reticulocyte count in peripheral blood\\n(10-15% after one week) reflecting accelerated marrowerythropoiesis.\\nCHRONIC\\n BLOOD LOSS.  When the loss of blood is slow\\nand insidious, the effects of anaemia will become apparentonly when the rate of loss is more than rate of productionand the iron stores are depleted. This results in iron deficiencyanaemia as seen in other clinical conditions discussed below.\\nHYPOCHROMIC ANAEMIA\\nHypochromic anaemia due to iron deficiency is the\\ncommonest cause of anaemia the world over. It is estimatedthat about 20% of women in child-bearing age group are irondeficient, while the overall prevalence in adult males is about2%. It is the most important, though not the sole, cause ofmicrocytic hypochromic anaemia in which all the three redcell indices (MCV, MCH and MCHC) are reduced and occursdue to defective haemoglobin synthesis. Hypochromicanaemias, therefore, are classified into 2 groups:\\nI. Hypochromic anaemia due to iron deficiency.\\nII. Hypochromic anaemias other than iron deficiency.\\nThe latter category includes 3 groups of disorders—\\nsideroblastic anaemia, thalassaemia and anaemia of chronic\\ndisorders.\\nIRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA\\nThe commonest nutritional deficiency disorder present\\nthroughout the world is iron deficiency but its prevalence ishigher in the developing countries. The factors responsiblefor iron deficiency in different populations are variable andare best understood in the context of normal iron metabolism.\\nIron Met abolism\\nThe amount of iron obtained from the diet should replace\\nthe losses from the skin, bowel and genitourinary tract. Theselosses together are about 1 mg daily in an adult male or in anon-menstruating female, while in a menstruating womanthere is an additional iron loss of 0.5-1 mg daily. The ironrequired for haemoglobin synthesis is derived from 2 primarysources—ingestion of foods containing iron (e.g. leafyvegetables, beans, meats, liver etc) and recycling of iron fromsenescent red cells (Fig.\\xa012.11).ABSORPTION.  The average Western diet contains 10-15 mg\\nof iron, out of which only 5-10% is normally absorbed. Inpregnancy and in iron deficiency, the proportion ofabsorption is raised to 20-30%. Iron is absorbed mainly inthe duodenum and proximal jejunum. Iron from diet containing\\nhaem is better absorbed than non-haem iron . Absorption of non-\\nhaem iron is enhanced by factors such as ascorbic acid(vitamin C), citric acid, amino acids, sugars, gastric secretionsand hydrochloric acid. Iron absorption is impaired by factorslike medicinal antacids, milk, pancreatic secretions, phytates,phosphates, ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) andtannates contained in tea.\\nNon-haem\\n iron  is released as ferrous or ferric form but\\nis absorbed almost exclusively as ferrous form; reduction offerric to ferrous form when required takes place at theintestinal brush border  by  ferric reductase . Transport across\\nthe membrane is accomplished by divalent metal trans-porter 1 (DMT 1). Once inside the gut cells, ferric iron maybe either stored as ferritin or further transported to transferrinby two vehicle proteins—ferroportin  and hephaestin . The\\nmechanism of dietary haem\\xa0 iron\\xa0 absorption is not clearly\\nunderstood yet but it is through a different transport thanDMT 1. After absorption of both non-haem and haem formsof iron, it comes into mucosal pool.\\nMajor mechanism of maintaining iron balance in the body\\nis by intestinal absorption of dietary iron. When the demandfor iron is increased (e.g. during pregnancy, menstruation,periods of growth and various diseases), there is increasediron absorption, while excessive body stores of iron causereduced intestinal iron absorption ( Fig.\\xa012.12,A  page 297).\\nTRANSPORT.  Iron is transported in plasma bound to a\\nβ-globulin, transferrin , synthesised in the liver. Transferrin-\\nbound iron is made available to the marrow where thedeveloping erythroid cells having transferring receptors  utilise\\niron for haemoglobin synthesis. It may be mentioned herethat tranferrin receptors are present on cells of many tissuesof the body but their number is greatest in the developingerythroblasts. Transferrin is reutilised after iron is releasedfrom it. A small amount of transferrin iron is delivered toother sites such as parenchymal cells of the liver. Normally,transferrin is about one-third saturated. But in conditionswhere transferrin-iron saturation is increased, parenchymaliron uptake is increased. Virtually, no iron is deposited inthe mononuclear-phagocyte cells (RE cells) from the plasmatransferrin-iron but instead these cells derive most of theiriron from phagocytosis of senescent red cells. Storage formof iron (ferritin and haemosiderin) in RE cells is normallynot functional but can be readily mobilised in response toincreased demands for erythropoiesis. However, conditionssuch as malignancy, infection and inflammation interferewith the release of iron from iron stores causing ineffectiveerythropoiesis.\\nEXCRETION.  The body is unable to regulate its iron content\\nby excretion alone. The amount of iron lost per day is\\n0.5-1 mg which is independent of iron intake. This loss isnearly twice more (i.e. 1-2 mg/day) in menstruating women.Iron is lost from the body in both sexes as a result ofdesquamation of epithelial cells from the gastrointestinal296SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nFigure 12.11 Daily iron cycle. Iron on absorption from upper small intestine circulates in plasma bound to transferrin and is transported to the\\nbone marrow for utilisation in haemoglobin synthesis. The mature red cells are released into circulation, which on completion o f their lifespan of 120\\ndays, die. They are then phagocytosed by RE cells and iron stored as ferritin and haemosiderin. Stored iron is mobilised in res ponse to increased\\ndemand and used for haemoglobin synthesis, thus completing the cycle (M = males; F = females).\\ntract, from excretion in the urine and sweat, and loss via hair\\nand nails. Iron excreted in the faeces mainly consists ofunabsorbed iron and desquamated mucosal cells.\\nDISTRIBUTION.  In an adult, iron is distributed in the body\\nas under:\\n1. Haemoglobin —present in the red cells, contains most of\\nthe body iron (65%).\\n2. Myoglobin —comprises a small amount of iron in the\\nmuscles (3.5%).\\n3. Haem and non-haem\\nenzymes —e.g. cytochrome,\\ncatalase, peroxidases, succinic dehydrogenase and\\nflavoproteins constitute a fraction of total body iron (0.5%).\\n4. Transferrin-bound\\xa0iron —circulates in the plasma and\\nconstitutes another fraction of total body iron (0.5%).\\nAll these forms of iron are in functional form.\\n5. Ferritin\\xa0and\\xa0haemosiderin —are the storage  forms  of excess\\niron (30%). They are stored in the mononuclear-phagocytecells of the spleen, liver and bone marrow and in the\\nparenchymal cells of the liver.\\nPathogenesis\\nIron deficiency anaemia develops when the supply of iron is\\ninadequate for the requirement of haemoglobin synthesis.Initially, negative iron balance is covered by mobilisationfrom the tissue stores so as to maintain haemoglobinsynthesis. It is only after the tissue stores of iron are exhaustedthat the supply of iron to the marrow becomes insufficientfor haemoglobin formation and thus a state of iron deficiencyanaemia develops. The development of iron deficiencydepends upon one or more of the following factors:1.Increased blood loss\\n2. Increased requirements3. Inadequate dietary intake4. Decreased intestinal absorption.\\nThe relative significance of these factors varies with the\\nage and sex of the patient (Table\\xa012.4).  Accordingly, certain\\n297CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\ngroups of individuals at increased risk of developing iron\\ndeficiency can be identified ( see below ). In general, in\\ndeveloped countries the mechanism of iron deficiency is\\nusually due to chronic occult blood loss, while in the\\ndeveloping countries poor intake of iron or defectiveabsorption are responsible for iron deficiency anaemia.\\nEtiology\\nIron deficiency anaemia is always secondary to an underlying\\ndisorder. Correction of the underlying cause, therefore, isessential part of its treatment. Based on the above-mentionedpathogenetic mechanisms, following etiologic factors are\\ninvolved in development of iron deficiency anaemia at\\ndifferent age and sex (Table 12.4):\\n1. FEMALES IN REPRODUCTIVE PERIOD OF LIFE.  The\\nhighest incidence of iron deficiency anaemia is in women\\nduring their reproductive years of life. It may be from one or\\nmore of the following causes:\\ni)Blood loss.  This is the most important cause of anaemia in\\nwomen during child-bearing age group. Commonly, it is due\\nto persistent and heavy menstrual blood loss such as occursin various pathologi cal states and due to insertion of IUCDs.\\nYoung girls at the onset of menstruation may develop mild\\nanaemia due to blood loss. Significant blood loss may occuras a result of repeated miscarriages.Figure 12.12 Contrasting pathways of absorption and transport of iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 12.4: Etiology of Iron Deficiency Anaemia.\\nI. INCREASED BLOOD LOSS\\n1.Uterine  e.g. excessive menstruation in reproductive years,\\nrepeated miscarriages, at onset of menarche, post-menopausal\\nuterine bleeding.\\n2.Gastrointestinal  e.g. peptic ulcer, haemorrhoids, hookworm\\ninfestation, cancer of stomach and large bowel, oesophagealvarices, hiatus hernia, chronic aspirin ingestion, ulcerative colitis,\\ndiverticulosis.\\n3.Renal tract  e.g. haematuria, haemoglobinuria.\\n4.Nose  e.g. repeated epistaxis.\\n5.Lungs  e.g. haemoptysis.\\nII. INCREASED REQUIREMENTS\\n1. Spurts of growth in infancy, childhood and adolescence.\\n2. Prematurity.3\\n. Pregnancy and lactation.\\nIII.INADEQUATE DIETARY INTAKE1. Poor economic status.2. Anorexia e.g. in pregnancy.3. Elderly individuals due to poor dentition, apathy and\\nfinancial constraints.\\nIV. DECREASED ABSORPTION\\n1. Partial or total gastrectomy2. Achlorhydria3. Intestinal malabsorption such as in coeliac disease.\\n298SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissuesii)Inadequate intake.  Inadequate intake of iron is prevalent\\nin women of lower economic status. Besides diet deficient in\\niron, other factors such as anorexia, impaired absorption and\\ndiminished bioavailability may act as contributory factors.\\niii)Increased requirements.  During pregnancy and\\nadolescence, the demand of body for iron is increased. During\\na normal pregnancy, about 750 mg of iron may be siphonedoff from the mother—about 400 mg to the foetus, 150 mg tothe placenta, and 200 mg is lost at parturition and lactation.\\nIf several pregnancies occur at short intervals, iron deficiency\\nanaemia certainly follows.\\n2. POST-MENOPAUSAL FEMALES.  Though the\\nphysiological demand for iron decreases after cessation of\\nmenstruation, iron deficiency anaemia may develop in post-\\nmenopausal women due to chronic blood loss. Following areamong the important causes during these years:\\ni)Post-menopausal uterine bleeding  due to carcinoma of the\\nuterus.ii)Bleeding from the alimentary tract  such as due to carcinoma\\nof stomach and large bowel and hiatus hernia.\\n3. ADULT MALES.  It is uncommon for adult males to\\ndevelop iron deficiency anaemia in the presence of normal\\ndietary iron content and iron absorption. The vast majorityof cases of iron deficiency anaemia in adult males are due to\\nchronic blood loss. The cause for chronic haemorrhage may\\nlie at one of the following sites:\\ni)Gastrointestinal tract  is the usual source of bleeding which\\nmay be due to peptic ulcer, haemorrhoids, hookworm\\ninfestation, carcinoma of stomach and large bowel,\\noesophageal varices, hiatus hernia, chronic aspirin ingestionand ulcerative colitis. Other causes in the GIT aremalabsorption and following gastrointestinal surgery.\\nii)Urinary tract  e.g. due to haematuria and haemoglobinuria.\\niii)Nose  e.g. in repeated epistaxis.\\niv)Lungs  e.g. in haemoptysis from various causes.4. INFANTS  AND CHILDREN.  Iron deficiency anaemia\\nis fairly common during infancy and childhood with a peak\\nincidence at 1-2 years of age. The principal cause for anaemiaat this age is increased demand of iron which is not met bythe inadequate intake of iron in the diet. Normal full-terminfant has sufficient iron stores for the first 4-6 months oflife, while premature infants have inadequate reservesbecause iron stores from the mother are mainly laid downduring the last trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, unless theinfant is given supplemental feeding of iron or iron-containing foods, iron deficiency anaemia develops.\\nClinical Features\\nAs already mentioned, iron deficiency anaemia is much more\\ncommon in women between the age of 20 and 45 years thanin men; at periods of active growth in infancy, childhoodand adolescence; and is also more frequent in prematureinfants. Initially, there are usually no clinical abnormalities.But subsequently, in addition to features of the underlyingdisorder causing the anaemia, the clinical consequences ofiron deficiency manifest in 2 ways—anaemia itself andepithelial tissue changes.\\n1. ANAEMIA.  The onset of iron deficiency anaemia is\\ngenerally slow. The usual symptoms are weakness, fatigue,\\ndyspnoea on exertion, palpitations and pallor of the skin,mucous membranes and sclerae. Older patients may developangina and congestive cardiac failure. Patients may haveunusual dietary cravings such as pica. Menorrhagia is acommon symptom in iron deficient women.\\n2.EPITHELIAL\\n TISSUE CHANGES.  Long-standing\\nchronic iron deficiency anaemia causes epithelial tissue\\nchanges in some patients. The changes occur in the nails(koilonychia or spoon-shaped nails), tongue (atrophicglossitis), mouth (angular stomatitis), and oesophaguscausing dysphagia from development of thin, membranouswebs at the postcricoid area (Plummer-Vinson syndrome).\\nFigure 12.13 Laboratory findings in iron deficiency anaemia.\\n299CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\nLaboratory Findings\\nThe development of anaemia progresses in 3 stages:\\nFirstly, storage iron depletion  occurs during which iron\\nreserves are lost without compromise of the iron supply\\nfor erythropoiesis.\\nThe next stage is iron deficient  erythropoiesis  during\\nwhich the erythroid iron supply is reduced without thedevelopment of anaemia.\\nThe final stage is the development of frank iron\\ndeficiency anaemia  when the red cells become microcytic\\nand hypochromic.\\nThe following laboratory tests can be used to assess the\\nvarying degree of iron deficiency (Fig. 12.13):\\n1.BLOOD PICTURE AND RED CELL INDICES.  The\\ndegree of anaemia varies. It is usually mild to moderatebut occasionally it may be marked (haemoglobin less than6 g/dl) due to persistent and severe blood loss. The salienthaematological findings in these cases are as under.\\ni) Haemoglobin.  The essential feature is a fall in\\nhaemoglobin concentration up to a variable degree.\\nii)\\xa0Red\\xa0cells.  The red cells in the blood film are hypo-\\nchromic and microcytic, and there is anisocytosis and\\npoikilocytosis (Fig.12.14,A).  Hypochromia generally\\nprecedes microcytosis. Hypochromia is due to poor fillingof the red cells with haemoglobin so that there is increasedcentral pallor. In severe cases, there may be only a thinrim of pink staining at the periphery. Target cells, ellipticalforms and polychromatic cells are often present.Normoblasts are uncommon. RBC count is below normalbut is generally not proportionate to the fall inhaemoglobin value. When iron deficiency is associatedwith severe folate or vitamin B\\n12 deficiency, a dimorphic\\nblood picture occurs with dual population of red cells—macrocytic as well as microcytic hypochromic.iii)\\xa0Reticulocyte\\xa0count.  The reticulocyte count is normal\\nor reduced but may be slightly raised (2-5%) in cases after\\nhaemorrhage.\\niv)\\xa0Absolute\\xa0values.  The red cell indices reveal a\\ndiminished MCV (below 50 fl), diminished MCH (below\\n15 pg), and diminished MCHC (below 20 g/dl).\\nv)\\xa0Leucocytes.  The total and differential white cell counts\\nare usually normal.\\nvi)\\xa0Platelets.  Platelet count is usually normal but may be\\nslightly to moderately raised in patients who have had\\nrecent bleeding.\\n2.BONE MARROW FINDINGS.  Bone marrow exami-\\nnation is not essential in such cases routinely but is done\\nin complicated cases so as to distinguish from other\\nhypochromic anaemias. The usual findings are as follows\\n(Fig.12.14,B):\\ni) Marrow cellularity.  The marrow cellularity is increased\\ndue to erythroid hyperplasia (myeloid-erythroid ratio\\ndecreased).\\nii)Erythropoiesis.  There is normoblastic erythropoiesis\\nwith predominance of small polychromatic normoblasts\\n(micronormoblasts). These normoblasts have a thin rimof cytoplasm around the nucleus and a ragged and\\nirregular cell border. The cytoplasmic maturation lags behind\\nso that the late normoblasts have pyknotic nucleus but\\npersisting polychromatic cytoplasm (compared frommegaloblastic anaemia in which the nuclear maturation\\nlags behind, page 307).\\niii) Other cells.  Myeloid, lymphoid and megakaryocytic\\ncells are normal in number and morphology.iv) Marrow iron.  Iron staining (Prussian blue reaction)\\ncarried out on bone marrow aspirate smear showsFigure 12.14 Iron deficiency anaemia. A, PBF showing microcytic hypochromic anaemia. There is moderate microcytosis and hypochromia.\\nB, Examination of bone marrow aspirate showing micronormoblastic erythropoiesis.\\n300SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissuesdeficient reticuloendothelial iron stores and absence of\\nsiderotic iron granules from developing normoblasts.\\n3.BIOCHEMICAL FINDINGS.  In addition to blood and\\nbone marrow examination, the following biochemical tests\\nare of value:\\ni) The serum iron  level is low (normal 40-140 μg/dl); it is\\noften under 50 μg/dl. When serum iron falls below\\n15 μg/dl, marrow iron stores are absent.\\nii) Total iron binding capacity (TIBC)  is high (normal 250-\\n450 μg/dl) and rises to give less than 10% saturation\\n(normal 33%). In anaemia of chronic disorders, however,\\nserum iron as well as TIBC are reduced.\\niii) Serum ferritin  is very low (normal 30-250 ng/ml)\\nindicating poor tissue iron stores. The serum ferritin is\\nraised in iron overload and is normal in anaemia of chronicdisorders.\\niv) Red cell protoporphyrin  is very low (normal 20-40\\nμg/dl) as a result of insufficient iron supply to form haem.\\nv) Serum transferrin receptor protein  which is normally\\npresent on developing erythroid cells and reflects total\\nred cell mass, is raised in iron deficiency due to its releasein circulation (normal level 4-9 μg/L as determined by\\nimmunoassay).\\nTreatment\\nThe management of iron deficiency anaemia consists of\\n2 essential principles: correction of disorder causing theanaemia, and correction of iron deficiency.\\n1. CORRECTION OF THE DISORDER.  The underlying\\ncause of iron deficiency is established after thorough check-\\nup and investigations. Appropriate surgical, medical orpreventive measures are instituted to correct the cause ofblood loss.\\n2. CORRECTIONOF IRON DEFICIENCY.  The lack of\\niron is corrected with iron therapy as under:\\ni) Oral therapy.  Iron deficiency responds very effectively\\nto the administration of oral iron salts such as ferrous sulfate,\\nferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate and polysaccharide iron.These preparations have varying amount of elemental ironin each tablet ranging from 39 mg to 105 mg. Optimalabsorption is obtained by giving iron fasting, but if side-effects occur (e.g. nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea)iron can be given with food or by using a preparation of loweriron content (e.g. ferrous gluconate containing 39 mgelemental iron). Oral iron therapy is continued long enough,both to correct the anaemia and to replenish the body ironstores. The response to oral iron therapy is observed byreticulocytosis which begins to appear in 3-4 days with apeak in about 10 days. Poor response to iron replacementmay occur from various causes such as: incorrect diagnosis,non-compliance, continuing blood loss, bone marrowsuppression by tumour or chronic inflammation, andmalabsorption.\\nii) Parenteral\\xa0therapy.  Parenteral iron therapy is indicated\\nin cases who are intolerant to oral iron therapy, in GIT\\ndisorders such as malabsorption, or a rapid replenishmentof iron stores is desired such as in women with severeanaemia a few weeks before expected date of delivery.Parenteral iron therapy is hazardous and expensive whencompared with oral administration. The haematologicalresponse to parenteral iron therapy is no faster than theadministration of adequate dose of oral iron but the storesare replenished much faster. Before giving the parenteraliron, total dose is calculated by a simple formula by multi-plying the grams of haemoglobin below normal with 250(250 mg of elemental iron is required for each gram of deficithaemoglobin), plus an additional 500 mg is added forbuilding up iron stores. A common preparation is irondextran which may be given as a single intramuscularinjection, or as intravenous infusion after dilution withdextrose or saline. The adverse effects with iron dextraninclude hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reactions,haemolysis, hypotension, circulatory collapse, vomiting andmuscle pain. Newer iron complexes such as sodium ferricgluconate and iron sucrose can be administered as repeatedintravenous injections with much lower side effects.\\nSIDEROBLASTIC ANAEMIA\\nThe sideroblastic anaemias comprise a group of disorders of\\ndiverse etiology in which the nucleated erythroid precursorsin the bone marrow, show characteristic ‘ringed sideroblasts.’\\nSiderocytes and Sideroblasts\\nSiderocytes and sideroblasts are erythrocytes and\\nnormoblasts respectively which contain cytoplasmic granules\\nof iron (Fig.12.15).\\nSIDEROCYTES.  These are red cells containing granules of\\nnon-haem iron. These granules stain positively with Prussian\\nblue reaction as well as stain with Romanowsky dyes whenthey are referred to as Pappenheimer bodies. Siderocytes are\\nnormally not present in the human peripheral blood but asmall number may appear following splenectomy. This isbecause the reticulocytes on release from the marrow arefinally sequestered in the spleen to become mature red cells.In the absence of spleen, the final maturation step takes placein the peripheral blood and hence siderocytes make theirappearance in the blood after splenectomy.\\nSIDEROBLASTS.  These are nucleated red cells (normo\\n-\\nblasts) containing siderotic granules which stain positively\\nFigure 12.15 A siderocyte containing Pappenheimer bodies, a\\nnormal sideroblast and a ring sideroblast.\\n301CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\nwith Prussian blue reaction. Depending upon the number,\\nsize and distribution of siderotic granules, sideroblasts maybe normal or abnormal (Fig. 12.16).\\nNormal sideroblasts  contain a few fine, scattered cytoplasmic\\ngranules representing iron which has not been utilised forhaemoglobin synthesis. These cells comprise 30-50% ofnormoblasts in the normal marrow but are reduced or absentin iron deficiency.\\nAbnormal sideroblasts  are further of 2 types:\\nOne type  is a sideroblast containing numerous, diffusely\\nscattered, coarse cytoplasmic granules and are seen in\\nconditions such as dyserythropoiesis and haemolysis. In thistype, there is no defect of haem or globin synthesis but thepercentage saturation of transferrin is increased.\\nThe other type is ringed sideroblast  in which haem\\nsynthesis is disturbed as occurs in sideroblastic anaemias.Ringed sideroblasts contain numerous large granules, oftenforming a complete or partial ring around the nucleus. Theringed arrangement of these granules is due to the presenceof iron-laden mitochondria around the nucleus.\\nTypes of Sideroblastic Anaemias\\nBased on etiology, sideroblastic anaemias are classified into\\nhereditary and acquired types. The acquired type is furtherdivided into primary and secondary forms:\\nI. HEREDITARY SIDEROBLASTIC ANAEMIA.  This is\\na rare X-linked disorder associated with defective enzyme\\nactivity of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase  required for\\nhaem synthesis. The affected males have moderate to markedanaemia while the females are carriers of the disorder anddo not develop anaemia. The condition manifests inchildhood or in early adult life.\\nII. ACQUIRED SIDEROBLASTIC ANAEMIA.  The\\nacquired sideroblastic anaemias are classified into primary\\nand secondary types.\\nA.Primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia. Primary, idio-\\npathic, or refractory acquired sideroblastic anaemia occursspontaneously in middle-aged and older individuals of both\\nsexes. The disorder has its pathogenesis in disturbed growthand maturation of erythroid precursors at the level ofhaematopoietic stem cell, possibly due to reduced activityof the enzyme, ALA synthetase. The anaemia is of moderateto severe degree and appears insidiously. The bone marrowcells commonly show chromosomal abnormalities, neutro-penia and thrombocytopenia with associated bleedingdiathesis. The spleen and liver may be either normal or mildlyenlarged, while the lymph nodes are not enlarged. Unlikeother types of sideroblastic anaemia, this type is regarded asa myelodysplastic disorder in the FAB (French-American-British) classification and thus, can be a preleukaemicdisorder (page 361). About 10% of individuals with refractoryacquired sideroblastic anaemia develop acute myelogenousleukaemia.\\nB. Secondary  acquired\\n sideroblastic anaemia. Acquired\\nsideroblastic anaemia may develop secondary to a variety\\nof drugs, chemicals, toxins, haematological and various otherdiseases.\\n1.Drugs, chemicals and toxins:  Isoniazid, an anti-tuberculous\\ndrug and a pyridoxine antagonist, is most commonly\\nassociated with development of sideroblastic anaemia byproducing abnormalities in pyridoxine metabolism. Otherdrugs occasionally causing acquired sideroblastic anaemiaare: cycloserine, chloramphenicol and alkylating agents (e.g.cyclophosphamide). Alcohol and lead also causesideroblastic anaemia. All these agents cause reversiblesideroblastic anaemia which usually resolves following\\nremoval of the offending agent.\\n2.Haematological disorders:  These include myelofibrosis,\\npolycythaemia vera, acute leukaemia, myeloma, lymphoma\\nand haemolytic anaemia.\\n3.Miscellaneous:  Occasionally, secondary sideroblastic\\nanaemia may occur in association with a variety of inflam-\\nmatory, neoplastic and autoimmune diseases such ascarcinoma, myxoedema, rheumatoid arthritis and SLE.\\nLaboratory Findings\\nSideroblastic anaemias usually show the following\\nhaematological features:\\n1. There is generally moderate to severe degree of anaemia.\\n2.The blood picture  shows hypochromic anaemia which\\nmay be microcytic, or there may be some normocytic red\\ncells as well (dimorphic).\\n3.Absolute values  (MCV, MCH and MCHC) are reduced\\nin hereditary type but MCV is often raised in acquired\\ntype.\\n4. Bone marrow examination  shows erythroid hyperplasia\\nwith usually macronormoblastic erythropoiesis. Marrow\\niron stores are raised and pathognomonic ring sideroblastsare present.\\n5. Serum ferritin  levels are raised.\\n6. Serum iron  is usually raised with almost complete\\nsaturation of TIBC.7. There is increased iron deposition  in the tissue.Figure 12.16 Sideroblastic anaemia bone marrow aspirate smear\\nin Perls’ stain shows marked excess of reticular iron and a ringed\\nsideroblast (arrow) showing Prusian blue granules in the cytoplasm.\\n302SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular TissuesTreatment\\nThe treatment of secondary sideroblastic anaemia is\\nprimarily focussed on removal of the offending agent. Nodefinite treatment is available for hereditary and idiopathictypes of sideroblastic anaemias. However, pyridoxine isadministered routinely to all cases of sideroblastic anaemia(200 mg per day for 2-3 months). Blood transfusions and othersupportive therapy are indicated in all patients.\\nDifferential diagnosis of various types of hypochromic\\nanaemias by laboratory tests is summarised in Table 12.5.\\nANAEMIA OF CHRONIC DISORDERS\\nOne of the commonly encountered anaemia is in patients of\\na variety of chronic systemic diseases in which anaemia\\ndevelops secondary to a disease process but there is no actualinvasion of the bone marrow. A list of such chronic systemicdiseases is given in Table 12.6.  In general, anaemia in chronic\\ndisorders is usually normocytic normochromic but can havemild degree of microcytosis and hypochromia unrelated toiron deficiency. The severity of anaemia is usually directlyrelated to the primary disease process. The anaemia iscorrected only if the primary disease is alleviated.\\nPathogenesis\\nA number of factors may contribute to the development of\\nanaemia in chronic systemic disorders, and in many condi-tions, the anaemia is complicated by other causes such asiron, B\\n12 and folate deficiency, hypersplenism, renal failure\\nwith consequent reduced erythropoietic activity, endocrineabnormalities etc. However, in general, 2 factors appear toplay significant role in the pathogenesis of anaemia in chronicdisorders. These are: defective red cell production  and reduced\\nred cell lifespan.\\n1. Defective red cell production.  Though there is abun-\\ndance of storage iron in these conditions but the amount of\\niron available to developing erythroid cells in the marrow issubnormal. The mononuclear phagocyte system ishyperplastic which traps all the available free iron due tothe activity of iron binding protein, lactoferrin. A defect inthe transfer of iron from macrophages to the developing\\nerythroid cells in the marrow leads to reduced availability\\nof iron for haem synthesis despite adequate iron stores,elevating serum ferritin levels. The defect lies in suppressionof erythropoieitn by inflammatory cytokines at some stagein erythropoiesis, and hepcidin which is the key ironregulatory hormone. These inflammatory cytokines includeTNF and IFN- β released in bacterial infections and tumours,\\nand IL-1 and IFN- γ released in patients of rheumatoid\\narthritis and autoimmune vasculitis (Fig.\\xa012.17).\\n2. Reducedred cell lifespan.  Decreased survival of\\ncirculating red cells in chronic renal disease is attributed tohyperplastic mononuclear phagocyte system.\\nLaboratory Findings\\nThe characteristic features of anaemia in these patients\\nuncomplicated by other deficiencies are as under:\\ni)\\xa0Haemoglobin.

Measurement of erythrocyte survival\\ngenerally reveals mild to moderate shortening of their\\nlifespan.\\nvi) Bone  marrow.  Examination of the marrow generally\\nreveals normal erythroid maturation. However, the red\\ncell precursors have reduced stainable iron than normal,while macrophages in the marrow usually containincreased amount of iron. Cases of chronic infection oftenhave myeloid hyperplasia and increase in plasma cells.\\nvii) Serum iron and TIBC. Serum iron is characteristically\\nreduced  in this group of anaemias while TIBC is low-to-\\nnormal (in contrast to iron deficiency where there is\\nreduction in serum iron but high TIBC, see Table12.5 ).\\nviii) Serum ferritin.  Serum ferritin levels are increased  in\\nthese patients and is the most distinguishing featurebetween true iron-deficiency anaemia and iron-deficienterythropoieisis in anemia of chronic diseases.\\nix)Other plasma proteins.  In addition, certain other\\nplasma proteins called ‘phase reactants’  are raised in\\npatients with chronic inflammation, probably under the\\nstimulus of interleukin-1 released by activatedmacrophages. These proteins include γ-globulin, C3,\\nhaptoglobin, α\\n1-antitrypsin and fibrinogen. Elevation of\\nthese proteins is responsible for raised ESR commonlypresent in these patients.\\nMEGALOBLASTIC ANAEMIA\\nThe megaloblastic anaemias are disorders caused by\\nimpaired DNA synthesis and are characterised by a distinc-tive abnormality in the haematopoietic precursors in the bonemarrow in which the maturation of the nucleus is delayed relative\\nto that of the cytoplasm. Since cell division is slow but\\ncytoplasmic development progresses normally, the nucleatedred cell precursors tend to be larger which Ehrlich in 1880termed megaloblasts.  Megaloblasts are both morphologically\\nand functionally abnormal with the result that the maturered cells formed from them and released into the peripheralblood are also abnormal in shape and size, the mostprominent abnormality being macrocytosis.\\nThe underlying defect for the asynchronous maturation\\nof the nucleus is defective DNA synthesis due to deficiencyof vitamin B\\n12 (cobalamin) and/or folic acid (folate). Less\\ncommon causes are interference with DNA synthesis bycongenital or acquired abnormalities of vitamin B\\n12 or folic\\nacid metabolism. Before considering the megaloblasticanaemia, an outline of vitamin B\\n12 and folic acid metabolism\\nis given for a better understanding of the subject.\\nThe salient nutritional aspects and metabolic functions\\nof vitamin B12 and folic acid are summarised in Table12.7.\\nVitamin B12 Metabolism\\nBIOCHEMISTRY.  Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is a complex\\norganometallic compound having a cobalt atom situatedwithin a corrin ring, similar to the structure of porphyrinfrom which haem is formed. In humans, there are2 metabolically active forms of cobalamin—methyl-cobalamin and adenosyl-cobalamin, which act ascoenzymes. The therapeutic vitamin B\\n12 preparation is\\ncalled cyanocobalamin.\\nSOURCES.  The only dietary sources of vitamin B12 are foods\\nof animal protein origin such as kidney, liver, heart, muscle\\nmeats, fish, eggs, cheese and milk. In contrast to folate, fruitsand vegetables contain practically no vitamin B\\n12 unless\\ncontaminated with bacteria. Cooking has little effect on itsactivity. Vitamin B\\n12 is synthesised in the human large bowel\\nby microorganisms but is not absorbed from this site and,Figure 12.17 Pathogenesis of anaemia of chronic disorders through\\nsuppression of erythropoiesis by cytokines.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 12.7: Salient Features of Vitamin B12 and Folate Metabolism.\\nFeature Vitamin B12 Folate\\n1.

Site of absorption Ileum Duodenum and jejunum\\n6. Mechanism of absorption Intrinsic factor Conversion to methyl-THF\\n7. Body stores 2-3 mg (enough for 2-4 yrs) 10-12 mg (enough for 4 months)\\n304SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissuesthus, the humans are entirely dependent upon dietary\\nsources. The average daily requirement for vitamin B12 is\\n2-4 μg.\\nABSORPTION.  After ingestion, vitamin B12 in food is\\nreleased and forms a stable complex with gastric R-binder.R-binder is a form of glycoprotein found in various secretions(e.g. saliva, milk, gastric juice, bile), phagocytes and plasma.On entering the duodenum, the vitamin B\\n12-R-binder\\ncomplex is digested releasing vitamin B12 which then binds\\nto intrinsic factor (IF). The IF is a glycoprotein of molecularweight 50,000 produced by the parietal cells of the stomachand its secretion roughly parallels that of hydrochloric acid.The vitamin B\\n12-IF complex, on reaching the distal ileum,\\nbinds to the specific receptors on the mucosal brush border,thereby enabling the vitamin to be absorbed. The IF,therefore, acts as cell-directed carrier protein similar totransferrin. The receptor-bound vitamin B\\n12-IF complex is\\ntaken into the ileal mucosal cells where after several hoursthe IF is destroyed, vitamin B\\n12 released and is transferred\\nto another transport protein, transcobalamin (TC) II. Thevitamin B\\n12-TC II complex is finally secreted into the portal\\ncirculation from where it is taken by the liver, bone marrowand other cells. There are 2 major vitamin B\\n12 binding\\nproteins—TC I and TC II, and a minor protein TC III. TC I isnot essential for vitamin B\\n12 transport but functions primarily\\nas a storage protein while TC III is similar to TC II and bindsa small amount of vitamin B\\n12 (see Fig. 12.12,B).\\nTISSUE\\xa0STORES.  Normally, the liver is the principal storage\\nsite of vitamin B12 and stores about 2 mg of the vitamin, while\\nother tissues like kidney, heart and brain together store about2 mg. The body stores of vitamin B\\n12 are adequate for 2-4\\nyears. Major source of loss is via bile and shedding ofintestinal epithelial cells. A major part of the excreted vitaminB\\n12 is reabsorbed in the ileum by the IF resulting in\\nenterohepatic circulation.\\nFUNCTIONS.  Vitamin B12 plays an important role in general\\ncell metabolism, particulary essential for normal\\nhaematopoiesis and for maintenance of integrity of thenervous system. Vitamin B\\n12 acts as a co-enzyme for 2 main\\nbiochemical reactions in the body:\\nFirstly, as methyl cobalamin (methyl B12) in the methylation\\nof homocysteine to methionine by methyl tetrahydrofolate(THF). The homocysteine-methionine reaction is closelylinked to folate metabolism (Fig.  12.18):\\nMethyl B\\n12Homocysteine   Methionine\\nWhen this reaction is impaired, folate metabolism is\\nderanged and results in defective DNA synthesis responsiblefor megaloblastic maturation.\\nSecondly, as adenosyl cobalamin (adenosyl B\\n12) in propionate\\nmetabolism for the conversion of methyl malonyl co-enzymeA to succinyl co-enzyme A:\\nAdenosyl  B\\n12\\nPropionyl CoA →Methyl malonyl CoA →Succinyl CoALack of adenosyl B12 leads to large increase in the level\\nof methyl malonyl CoA and its precursor, propionyl CoA.This results in synthesis of certain fatty acids which areincorporated into the neuronal lipids. This biochemicalabnormality may contribute to the neurologic complicationsof vitamin B\\n12 deficiency.\\nFolate Metabolism\\nBIOCHEMISTRY.  Folate or folic acid, a yellow compound,\\nis a member of water-soluble B complex vitamins with the\\nchemical name of pteroyl glutamic acid (PGA).  Folic acid does\\nnot exist as such in nature but exists as folates inpolyglutamate form (conjugated folates). For its metabolicaction as co-enzyme, polyglutamates must be reduced todihydro- and tetrahydrofolate forms.\\nSOURCES.  Folate exists in different plants, bacteria and\\nanimal tissues. Its main dietary sources are fresh green leafy\\nvegetables, fruits, liver, kidney, and to a lesser extent, musclemeats, cereals and milk. Folate is labile and is largelydestroyed by cooking and canning. Some amount of folatesynthesised by bacteria in the human large bowel is notavailable to the body because its absorption takes place inthe small intestine. Thus, humans are mainly dependentupon diet for its supply. The average daily requirement is100-200 μg.\\nABSORPTION AND TRANSPORT. Folate is normally\\nabsorbed from the duodenum and upper jejunum and to alesser extent, from the lower jejunum and ileum. However,absorption depends upon the form of folate in the diet.Polyglutamate form in the foodstuffs is first cleaved by theenzyme, folate conjugase, in the mucosal cells to mono- anddiglutamates which are readily assimilated. Synthetic folicacid preparations in polyglutamate form are also absorbedas rapidly as mono- and diglutamate form because of theFigure 12.18 Biochemical basis of megaloblastic anaemia (THF =\\ntetrahydrofolate; DHF = dihydrofolate; PGA = pteroyl glutamic acid; dUMP\\n= deoxy uridylate monophosphate; dTMP = deoxy thymidylate monophos-phate).\\n305CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Seriesabsence of natural inhibitors. Mono- and diglutamates\\nundergo further reduction in the mucosal cells to formtetrahydrofolate (THF), a monoglutamate. THF circulates inthe plasma as methylated compound, methyl THF, boundto a protein. Once methyl THF is transported into the cell bya carrier protein, it is reconverted to polyglutamate ( see\\nFig. 12.12,C).\\nTISSUE\\xa0STORES.  The liver and red cells are the main storage\\nsites of folate, largely as methyl THF polyglutamate form.\\nThe total body stores of folate are about 10-12 mg enoughfor about 4 months. Normally, folate is lost from the sweat,saliva, urine and faeces.\\nFUNCTIONS.  Folate plays an essential role in cellular\\nmetabolism. It acts as a co-enzyme for 2 important bio-\\nchemical reactions involving transfer of 1-carbon units (viz.methyl and formyl groups) to various other compounds.These reactions are as under:\\nThymidylate synthetase reaction.  Formation of deoxy\\nthymidylate monophosphate (dTMP) from its precursorform, deoxy uridylate monophosphate (dUMP).\\nMethylation of homocysteine to methionine. This reaction is\\nlinked to vitamin B12 metabolism \\xa0(Fig.\\xa012.18).\\nThese biochemical reactions are considered in detail\\nbelow together with biochemical basis of the megaloblasticanaemia.\\nBiochemical Basis of Megaloblastic Anaemia\\nThe basic biochemical abnormality common to both vitamin\\nB\\n12 and folate deficiency is a block in the pathway of DNA\\nsynthesis and that there is an inter-relationship betweenvitamin B\\n12 and folate metabolism in the methylation reaction\\nof homocysteine to methionine (Fig.\\xa012.18).\\nAs stated above, folate as co-enzyme methylene THF, is\\nrequired for transfer of 1-carbon moieties (e.g. methyl andformyl) to form building blocks in DNA synthesis. These1-carbon moieties are derived from serine or formimino-glutamic acid (FIGLU). Two of the important folate-dependent (1-carbon transfer) reactions for formation ofbuilding blocks in DNA synthesis are as under:\\n1. Thymidylate synthetase reaction.  This reaction involves\\nsynthesis of deoxy thymidylate monophosphate (dTMP)\\nfrom deoxy uridylate monophosphate (dUMP). The methylgroup of dUMP → dTMP reaction is supplied by the co-\\nenzyme, methylene-THF. After the transfer of 1-carbon frommethylene-THF, dihydrofolate (DHF) is produced whichmust be reduced to active THF by the enzyme DHF-reductasebefore it can participate in further 1-carbon transfer reaction.Drugs like methotrexate (anti-cancer) and pyrimethamine(antimalarial) are inhibitory to the enzyme, DHF-reductase,thereby inhibiting the DNA synthesis.\\n2. Homocysteine-methionine reaction.  Homocysteine is\\nconverted into methionine by transfer of a methyl group from\\nmethylene-THF. After transfer of 1-carbon from methylene-THF, THF is produced. This reaction requires the presenceof vitamin B\\n12 (methyl-B12).\\nDeficiency of folate from any cause results in reduced\\nsupply of the coenzyme, methylene-THF, and thus interfereswith the synthesis of DNA. Deficiency of vitamin B12 traps\\nfolate as its transport form, methyl-THF, thereby resultingin reduced formation of the active form, methylene-THF,needed for DNA synthesis. This is referred to as methyl-folate\\ntrap hypothesis.  An alternative hypothesis of inter-relationship\\nof B\\n12 and folate is the formate-saturation hypothesis.  According\\nto this hypothesis, the active substrate is formyl-THF.Vitamin B\\n12 deficiency results in reduced supply of formate\\nto THF causing reduced generation of the active compound,formyl THF.\\nEtiology and Classification of Megaloblastic Anaemia\\nThe etiology of megaloblastic anaemia varies in different\\nparts of the world. As outlined in Table 12.8, megaloblastic\\nanaemia is classified into 3 broad groups: vitamin B\\n12\\ndeficiency, folate deficiency, and deficiency from othercauses.\\n1. VITAMIN\\xa0B\\n12\\xa0DEFICIENCY.  In Western countries,\\ndeficiency of vitamin B12 is more commonly due to pernicious\\n(Addisonian) anaemia. True vegetarians like traditional\\nIndian Hindus and breast-fed infants have dietary lack ofvitamin B\\n12. Gastrectomy by lack of intrinsic factor, and small\\nintestinal lesions involving distal ileum where absorption ofvitamin B\\n12 occurs, may cause deficiency of the vitamin.\\nDeficiency of vitamin B12 takes at least 2 years to develop\\nwhen the body stores are totally depleted.\\n2. FOLATE\\xa0DEFICIENCY.  Folate deficiency is more often\\ndue to poor dietary intake. Other causes include\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 12.8: Etiologic Classification of Megaloblastic\\nAnaemia.\\nI. VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY\\nA. Inadequate dietary intake e.g. strict vegetarians, breast-fed infants.\\nB.

FOLATE DEFICIENCY\\nA. Inadequate dietary intake  e.g. in alcoholics, teenagers, infants, old\\nage, poverty.\\nB. Malabsorption e.g. in tropical sprue, coeliac disease, partial\\ngastrectomy, jejunal resection, Crohn’s disease.\\nC. Excess demand\\n1.Physiological:  pregnancy, lactation, infancy.\\n2.Pathological :  malignancy, increased haematopoiesis, chronic\\nexfoliative skin disorders, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis.\\nD. Excess urinary folate loss  e.g. in active liver disease, congestive\\nheart failure.\\nIII.OTHER CAUSES\\nA. Impaired metabolism  e.g. inhibitors of dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase\\nsuch as methotrexate and pyrimethamine; alcohol, congenital\\nenzyme deficiencies.\\nB. Unknown etiology  e.g. in Di Guglielmo’s syndrome, congenital\\ndyserythropoietic anaemia, refractory megaloblastic anaemia.306SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissuesmalabsorption, excess folate utilisation such as in pregnancy\\nand in various disease states, chronic alcoholism, and excessurinary folate loss. Folate deficiency arises more rapidly thanvitamin B\\n12 deficiency since the body’s stores of folate are\\nrelatively low which can last for up to 4 months only.\\nPatients with tropical sprue are often deficient in both\\nvitamin B12 and folate. Combined deficiency of vitamin B12\\nand folate may occur from severe deficiency of vitamin B12\\nbecause of the biochemical interrelationship with folatemetabolism.\\n3. OTHER\\xa0CAUSES.  In addition to deficiency of vitamin\\nB\\n12 and folate, megaloblastic anaemias may occasionally be\\ninduced by other factors unrelated to vitamin deficiency.\\nThese include many drugs which interfere with DNAsynthesis, acquired defects of haematopoietic stem cells, andrarely, congenital enzyme deficiencies.\\nClinical Features\\nDeficiency of vitamin B\\n12 and folate may cause following\\nclinical manifestations which may be present singly or in\\ncombination and in varying severity:\\n1. Anaemia.  Macrocytic megaloblastic anaemia is the\\ncardinal feature of deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folate.\\nThe onset of anaemia is usually insidious and gradually\\nprogressive.\\n2. Glossitis.  Typically, the patient has a smooth, beefy, red\\ntongue.\\n3. Neurologic manifestations.  Vitamin B12 deficiency, parti-\\ncularly in patients of pernicious anaemia, is associated with\\nsignificant neurological manifestations in the form ofsubacute combined, degeneration of the spinal cord andperipheral neuropathy (Chapter 30), while folate deficiencymay occasionally develop neuropathy only. The underlyingpathologic process consists of demyelination of the peripheralnerves, the spinal cord and the cerebrum. Signs andsymptoms include numbness, paraesthesia, weakness,ataxia, poor finger coordination and diminished reflexes.4. Others.  In addition to the cardinal features mentioned\\nabove, patients may have various other symptoms. Theseinclude: mild jaundice, angular stomatitis, purpura, melaninpigmentation, symptoms of malabsorption, weight loss andanorexia.\\nLaboratory Findings\\nThe investigations of a suspected case of megaloblastic\\nanaemia are aimed at 2 aspects:\\nA. General laboratory investigations of anaemia which include\\nblood picture, red cell indices, bone marrow findings, and\\nbiochemical tests.\\nB. Special tests to establish the cause of megaloblastic anaemia\\nas to know whether it is due to deficiency of vitamin B\\n12\\nor folate.\\nBased on these principles, the following scheme of\\ninvestigations is followed:\\nA. General Laboratory Findings\\n1.\\xa0BLOOD\\xa0PICTURE\\xa0AND\\xa0RED\\xa0CELL\\xa0INDICES.  Esti-\\nmation of haemoglobin, examination of a blood film and\\nevaluation of absolute values are essential preliminaryinvestigations (Fig. 12.19):\\ni)\\xa0Haemoglobin.  Haemoglobin estimation reveals values\\nbelow the normal range. The fall in haemoglobinconcentration may be of a variable degree.\\nii)\\xa0Red\\xa0cells.  Red blood cell morphology in a blood film\\nshows the characteristic macrocytosis. However,\\nmacrocytosis  can also be seen in several other disorders\\nsuch as: haemolysis, liver disease, chronic alcoholism,hypothyroidism, aplastic anaemia, myeloproliferativedisorders and reticulocytosis. In addition, the blood smeardemonstrates marked anisocytosis, poikilocytosis andpresence of macroovalocytes. Basophilic stippling andoccasional normoblast may also be seen (Fig.\\xa012.20,\\xa0A).\\niii) Reticulocyte count.  The reticulocyte count is generally\\nlow to normal in untreated cases.\\nFigure 12.19 General laboratory findings in megaloblastic anaemia.\\n307CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\niv) Absolute values.  The red cell indices reveal an elevated\\nMCV (above 120 fl) proportionate to the severity of\\nmacrocytosis, elevated MCH (above 50 pg) and normalor reduced MCHC.\\nv)Leucocytes.  The total white blood cell count may be\\nreduced. Presence of characteristic hypersegmented\\nneutrophils (having more than 5 nuclear lobes) in theblood film should raise the suspicion of megaloblasticanaemia. An occasional myelocyte may also be seen.\\nvi)Platelets.  Platelet count may be moderately reduced\\nin severely anaemic patients. Bizarre forms of platelets\\nmay be seen.\\n2.BONE MARROW FINDINGS.  The bone marrow\\nexamination is very helpful in the diagnosis of\\nmegaloblastic anaemia. Significant findings of marrowexamination are as under (Fig. 12.20,B):\\ni) Marrow cellularity.  The marrow is hypercellular with\\na decreased myeloid-erythroid ratio.\\nii)Erythropoiesis.  Erythroid hyperplasia is due to\\ncharacteristic megaloblastic erythropoiesis. Megaloblasts\\nare abnormal, large, nucleated erythroid precursors,\\nhaving nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony i.e. the nuclei areless mature than the development of cytoplasm. The nucleiare large, having fine, reticular and open chromatin thatstains lightly, while the haemoglobinisation of thecytoplasm proceeds normally or at a faster rate i.e. nuclear\\nmaturation lags behind that of cytoplasm  (compared from iron\\ndeficiency anaemia in which cytoplasmic maturation lagsbehind, page 299). Megaloblasts with abnormal mitosesmay be seen. Features of ineffective erythropoiesis suchas presence of degenerated erythroid precursors may bepresent.iii) Other cells.  Granulocyte precursors are also affected\\nto some extent. Giant forms of metamyelocytes and band\\ncells may be present in the marrow. Megakaryocytes areusually present in normal number but may occasionally\\nbe decreased and show abnormal morphology such as\\nhypersegmented nuclei and agranular cytoplasm.\\niv)Marrow iron.  Prussian blue staining for iron in the\\nmarrow shows an increase in the number and size of iron\\ngranules in the erythroid precursors. Ring sideroblasts are,however, rare. Iron in the reticulum cells is increased.\\nv)Chromosomes.  Marrow cells may show variety of\\nrandom chromosomal abnormalities such as chromosome\\nbreaks, centromere spreading etc.\\n3.\\nBIOCHEMICAL FINDINGS.  In addition to the general\\nblood and marrow investigations and specific tests to\\ndetermine the cause of deficiency (described below), the\\nfollowing biochemical abnormalities are observed in cases\\nof megaloblastic anaemia:\\ni) There is rise in serum unconjugated bilirubin and LDH  as\\na result of ineffective erythropoiesis causing marrow cell\\nbreakdown.\\nii) The serum iron and ferritin  may be normal or elevated.\\nB. Special Tests for Cause of Specific Deficiency\\nIn evaluating a patient of megaloblastic anaemia, it is\\nimportant to determine the specific vitamin deficiency by\\nassay of vitamin B12 and folate. In sophisticated clinical\\nlaboratories, currently automated multiparametric,\\nrandom access analysers are employed based on separa-tion techniques by chemiluminescence and enzyme-linked\\nfluorescence detection systems which have largelyFigure 12.20 Megaloblastic anaemia.

Traditional tests are briefly described below.\\nTESTS FOR VITAMIN B12DEFICIENCY.  The normal\\nrange of vitamin B12 in serum is 280-1000 pg/ml. Values\\nless than 100 pg/ml indicate clinically deficient stage.Traditional tests employed to establish vitamin B\\n12\\ndeficiency are serum vitamin B12 assay, Schilling (24-hour\\nurinary excretion) test and serum enzyme levels.\\n1. SERUM VITAMIN B12 ASSAY.  Assay of vitamin B12 in\\nblood can be done by 2 methods—microbiological assay\\nand radioassay.\\ni) Microbiological assay.  In this test, the serum sample to\\nbe assayed is added to a medium containing all other\\nessential growth factors required for a vitaminB\\n12-dependent microorganism. The medium along with\\nmicroorganism is incubated and the amount of vitaminB\\n12 is determined turbimetrically which is then compared\\nwith the growth produced by a known amount of vitaminB\\n12. Several organisms have been used for this test such\\nas Euglena gracilis, Lactobacillus leichmannii, Escherichia coli\\nand Ochromonas malhamensis. E. gracilis  is, however, consi-\\ndered more sensitive and accurate. The addition of anti-biotics to the test interferes with the growth and yieldsfalse low result.\\nii) Radioassay.  Assays of serum B\\n12 by radioisotope\\ndilution (RID) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) have been\\ndeveloped. These tests are more sensitive and have theadvantage over microbiologic assays in that they aresimpler and more rapid, and the results are unaffected byantibiotics and other drugs which may affect the livingorganisms.\\n2.  SCHILLING TEST (24 HOUR URINARY EXCRETION\\nTEST).  Schilling test is done to detect vitamin B\\n12\\ndeficiency as well as to distinguish and detect lack of IF\\nand malabsorption syndrome. The results of test alsodepend upon good renal function and proper urinarycollection. Radioisotope used for labeling B\\n12 is either 58Co\\nor 57Co. The test is performed in 3 stages as under:\\nStage I: Without IF.  The patient after an overnight fasting\\nis administered oral dose of 1 μg of radioactively labelled\\nvitamin B12 (‘hot’ B12) in 200 ml of water. At the same\\ntime, 1 mg of unlabelled vitamin B12 (‘cold’ B12) is given\\nby intramuscular route; this ‘cold’ B12 will saturate the\\nserum as well as the tissue binding sites. The patient iskept fasting for a further period of 2 hours, followingwhich urinary excretion of B\\n12 is estimated:\\nIn normal individuals, 24-hour urinary excretion is\\n>10% of the oral dose of ‘hot’ B12.\\nPatients with IF deficiency excrete lower quantity of\\n‘hot’ B12 which is further confirmed by repeating the test\\nas in stage II given below.\\nStage II: With IF.  If the 24-hour urinary excretion of ‘hot’\\nB12 is low, the test is repeated using the same procedure\\nas in stage I but in addition high oral dose of IF is\\nadministered along with ‘hot’ B12.\\nIf the 24-hour urinary excretion of ‘hot’ B12 is now\\nnormal, the low value in first stage of the test was due toIF deficiency (i.e. pernicious anaemia).\\nPatients with pernicious anaemia have abnormal test\\neven after treatment with vitamin B12 due to IF deficiency.\\nHowever, abnormal 24-hour urinary excretion of ‘hot’ B12\\nis further investigated in stage III for a cause in intestinalmalabsorption of ‘hot’ B’\\n12.\\nStage III: Test for malabsorption of vitamin B12. Some\\npatients absorb vitamin B12 in water as was stipulated in\\nthe original Schilling test. Modified Schilling test employsthe use of protein-bound vitamin B\\n12. In conditions\\ncausing malabsorption, the test is repeated after a courseof treatment with antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs.\\n3. SERUM ENZYME LEVELS.   Besides Schilling test,\\nanother way of distinguishing whether megaloblastic\\nanaemia is due to cobalamine or folate is by serumdetermination of methylmalonic acid and homocysteineby sophisticated enzymatic assays. Both are elevated incobalamine deficiency, while in folate deficiency there isonly elevation of homocysteine and not of methylmalonicacid.\\nTESTS FOR FOLATE DEFICIENCY.  The normal range\\nof serum folate is 6-18 ng/ml. Values of 4 ng/ml or less\\nare generally considered to be diagnostic of folatedeficiency. Measurement of formiminoglutamic acid\\n(FIGLU) urinary excretion  after histidine load was used\\nformerly for assessing folate status but it is less specificand less sensitive than the serum assays. Currently, thereare 3 tests used to detect folate deficiency—urinaryexcretion of FIGLU, serum and red cell folate assay.\\n1.URINARY EXCRETION OF FIGLU.  Folic acid is\\nrequired for conversion of formiminoglutamic acid\\n(FIGLU) to glutamic acid in the catabolism of histidine.Thus, on oral administration of histidine, urinary excretionof FIGLU is increased if folate deficiency is present.\\n2. SERUM FOLATE ASSAY.  The folate in serum can be\\nestimated by 2 methods—microbiological assay and\\nradioassay.\\ni) Microbiological assay.  This test is based on the principle\\nthat the serum folate acid activity is mainly due to the\\npresence of a folic acid co-enzyme, 5-methyl THF, andthat this compound is required for growth of themicroorganism, Lactobacillus casei.  The growth of L. casei\\nis inhibited by addition of antibiotics.\\nii)\\xa0Radioassay.  The principle and method of radioassay\\nby radioisotope dilution (RID) test are similar to that for\\nserum B\\n12 assay. The test employs labelled pteroyl-\\nglutamic acid or methyl-THF. Commercial kits areavailable which permit simultaneous assay of bothvitamin B\\n12 and folate.\\n3. RED CELL FOLATE ASSAY.  Red cells contain 20-50\\ntimes more folate than the serum; thus red cell folate assayis more reliable indicator of tissue stores of folate thanserum folate assay. Microbiological radioassay andprotein-binding assay methods can be used for estimation309CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Seriesof red cell folate. Red cell folate values are decreased in\\npatients with megaloblastic anaemia as well as in patientswith pernicious anaemia.\\nTreatment\\nMost cases of megaloblastic anaemia need therapy with\\nappropriate vitamin. This includes: hydroxycobalamin asintramuscular injection 1000 μg for 3 weeks and oral folic\\nacid 5 mg tablets daily for 4 months. Severely-anaemicpatients in whom a definite deficiency of either vitamincannot be established with certainty are treated with bothvitamins concurrently. Blood transfusion should be avoidedsince it may cause circulatory overload. Packed cells may,however, be infused slowly.\\nTreatment of megaloblastic anaemia is quite gratifying.\\nThe marrow begins to revert back to normal morphologywithin a few hours of initiating treatment and becomesnormoblastic within 48 hours of start of treatment. Reticulo-cytosis appears within 4-5 days after therapy is started andpeaks at day 7. Haemoglobin should rise by 2-3 g/dl eachfortnight. The peripheral neuropathy may show someimprovement but subacute combined degeneration of thespinal cord is irreversible.\\nPERNICIOUS ANAEMIA\\nPernicious anaemia (PA) was first described by Addison in\\n1855 as a chronic disorder of middle-aged and elderlyindividual of either sex in which intrinsic factor (IF) secretionceases owing to atrophy of the gastric mucosa. The conditionis, therefore, also termed Addisonian megaloblastic anaemia.The average age at presentation is 60 years but rarely it canbe seen in children under 10 years of age (juvenile perniciousanaemia). PA is seen most frequently in individuals ofnorthern European descent and African Americans and isuncommon in South Europeans and Orientals.\\nPathogenesis\\nThere is evidence to suggest that the atrophy of gastric\\nmucosa in PA resulting in absence or low level of IF is causedby an autoimmune reaction against gastric parietal cells. Theevidences in support of immunological abnormalities inpernicious anaemia are as under:\\n1.The incidence of PA is high in patients with other auto-\\nimmune diseases  such as Graves’ disease, myxoedema,\\nthyroiditis, vitiligo, diabetes and idiopathic adrenocortical\\ninsufficiency.\\n2. Patients with PA have abnormal circulating autoantibodies\\nsuch as anti-parietal cell antibody (90% cases) and anti-\\nintrinsic factor antibody (50% cases).\\n3.Relatives  of patients with PA have an increased incidence\\nof the disease or increased presence of autoantibodies.\\n4.Corticosteroids  have been reported to be beneficial in\\ncuring the disease both pathologically and clinically.\\n5. PA is more common in patients with agammaglobulinaemia\\nsupporting the role of cellular immune system in destruction\\nof parietal cells.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The most characteristic\\npathologic finding in PA is gastric atrophy affecting theacid- and pepsin-secreting portion of the stomach andsparing the antrum (Chapter 20). Gastric epithelium mayshow cellular atypia. About 2-3% cases of PA developcarcinoma of the stomach. Other pathologic changes aresecondary to vitamin B\\n12 deficiency and include\\nmegaloblastoid alterations in the gastric and intestinalepithelium and neurologic abnormalities such asperipheral neuropathy and spinal cord damage.\\nClinical Features\\nThe disease has insidious onset and progresses slowly. The\\nclinical manifestations are mainly due to vitamin B\\n12\\ndeficiency. These include: anaemia, glossitis, neurologicalabnormalities (neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration\\nof the spinal cord, retrobulbar neuritis), gastrointestinal\\nmanifestations (diarrhoea, anorexia, weight loss, dyspepsia),hepatosplenomegaly, congestive heart failure andhaemorrhagic manifestations. Other autoimmune diseasessuch as autoimmune thyroiditis may be associated.\\nDiagnostic Criteria\\nSince diagnosis of PA requires the patient to receive\\nlifelong parenteral B\\n12 therapy, the diagnosis of PA is made\\nby combined clinical and laboratory evaluation as perfollowing diagnostic criteria:\\nI. Major criteria:\\ni)  Low serum B\\n12 level in presence of normal renal function\\nii) Megaloblastic anaemia in bone marrow examination,\\nwhich should not be due to folate deficiencyiii) Positive test for IF antibody\\nII. Minor laboratory criteria:\\ni)  Macrocytosis in PBF\\nii)  Anaemia of variable degree\\niii)  Hypergastrinaemiaiv)  Positive gastric parietal cell antibody\\nv)  Raised plasma homocysteine level\\nvi)  Gastric pH above 6\\nIII. Minor clinical criteria:\\ni) Neurologic features of parasthaesia, numbness or ataxia\\nii) Hypothyroidism\\niii) Family history of PA or hypothyroidism\\niv) Vitiligo\\nIV. Reference standard criteria:\\ni) Schilling test showing malabsorption of oral cyano-\\ncobalamin corrected by simultaneous administration ofIF.\\nTreatment\\nPatients of PA are treated with vitamin B\\n12 in the following\\nway:\\n1. Parenteral  vitamin B12 replacement therapy.\\n2. Symptomatic and supportive therapy such as\\nphysiotherapy for neurologic deficits and occasionally bloodtransfusion.\\n3. Follow-up for early detection of cancer of the stomach.310SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nMost of the abnormalities due to vitamin B12 deficiency\\ncan be corrected except the irreversible damage to the spinal\\ncord. Corticosteroid therapy can improve the gastric lesionwith a return of acid secretion but the higher incidence ofgastric polyps and cancer of the stomach in these patientscan only be detected by frequent follow-up.\\nHAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIAS\\nGENERAL  ASPECTS\\nDefinition and Classification\\nHaemolytic anaemias are defined as anaemias resulting from\\nan increase in the rate of red cell destruction. Normally, effetered cells undergo lysis at the end of their lifespan of 120\\n+30\\ndays within the cells of reticuloendothelial (RE) system inthe spleen and elsewhere (extravascular haemolysis), andhaemoglobin is not liberated into the plasma in appreciableamounts. The red cell lifespan is shortened in haemolyticanaemia i.e. there is accelerated haemolysis. However,shortening of red cell lifespan does not necessarily result inanaemia. In fact, compensatory bone marrow hyperplasiamay cause 6 to 8-fold increase in red cell production withoutcausing anaemia to the patient, so-called compensated\\nhaemolytic disease.\\nThe premature destruction of red cells in haemolytic\\nanaemia may occur by 2 mechanisms:\\nFirstly,  the red cells undergo lysis in the circulation and\\nrelease their contents into plasma (intravascular haemolysis).\\nIn these cases the plasma haemoglobin rises substantiallyand part of it may be excreted in the urine (haemoglobinuria).\\nSecondly,  the red cells are taken up by cells of the RE\\nsystem where they are destroyed and digested (extravascular\\nhaemolysis).  In extravascular haemolysis, plasma\\nhaemoglobin level is, therefore, barely raised.Extravascular haemolysis is more common than the\\nformer. One or more factors may be involved in thepathogenesis of various haemolytic anaemias.\\nHaemolytic anaemias are broadly classified into 2 main\\ncategories:\\nI.Acquired haemolytic anaemias  caused by a variety of\\nextrinsic environmental factors (extracorpuscular).\\nII.Hereditary haemolytic anaemias  are usually the result of\\nintrinsic red cell defects (intracorpuscular).\\nA simplified classification based on these mechanisms is\\ngiven in Table\\xa012.9  and diagrammatically represented in\\nFig.\\xa012.21.\\nFeatures of Haemolysis\\nA number of clinical and laboratory features are shared by\\nvarious types of haemolytic anaemias. These are brieflydescribed below:\\nGENERAL CLINICAL FEATURES.  Some of the general\\nclinical features common to most congenital and acquired\\nhaemolytic anaemias are as under:\\n1.Presence of pallor of mucous membranes.\\n2. Positive family history with life-long anaemia in patients\\nwith congenital haemolytic anaemia.\\n3. Mild fluctuating jaundice due to unconjugated\\nhyperbilirubinaemia.\\n4. Urine turns dark on standing due to excess of\\nurobilinogen in urine.\\n5.\\nSplenomegaly is found in most chronic haemolytic\\nanaemias, both congenital and acquired.6. Pigment gallstones are found in some cases.\\nLABORATORY EVALUATION OF HAEMOLYSIS.\\nPathways by which haemoglobin derived from effete red cells\\nis metabolised is already discussed on page 290. TheFigure 12.21 Diagrammatic representation of classification of haemolytic anaemias based on principal mechanisms of haemolysis.\\n311CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\ninvestigations of a patient suspected to have haemolytic\\nanaemia should provide answers to 3 vital questions:\\n1. Is there evidence of haemolysis?2. What is the type of haemolytic mechanism?\\n3. What is the precise diagnosis?\\nThe laboratory findings are conveniently divided into the\\nfollowing 4 groups:\\nI. Tests of increased red cell breakdown:\\n1.Serum bilirubin —unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is\\nraised.2.Urine urobilinogen  is raised but there is no bilirubinuria.\\n3.Faecal stercobilinogen  is raised.4.Serum haptoglobin  (α-globulin binding protein) is reduced\\nor absent.\\n5.Plasma lactic dehydrogenase  is raised.\\n6.Evidences of intravascular haemolysis  in the form of haemo-\\nglobinaemia, haemoglobinuria, methaemoglobinaemia and\\nhaemosiderinuria.\\nII.

Tests of damage to red cells:\\n1.Routine blood film  shows a variety of abnormal\\nmorphological appearances of red cells described on page\\n366 and illustrated in Fig.12.10  already. A summary of\\ncontributory features of morphology of RBCs in arriving atthe diagnosis of haemolytic anaemia and its cause is givenin Table 12.10.\\n2.Osmotic fragility  is increased or decreased.\\n3.Autohaemolysis test  with or without addition of glucose.\\n4.Coombs’ antiglobulin test.\\n5.Electrophoresis  for abnormal haemoglobins.\\n6.Estimation of HbA\\n2.\\n7.Estimation of HbF.\\n8.Tests for sickling.\\n9.Screening test for G6PD deficiency  and other enzymes (e.g.\\nHeinz bodies test).\\nIV.Tests for shortened red cell lifespan.  A shortened red\\ncell survival is best tested by 51Cr labelling method. Normal\\nRBC lifespan of 120 days is shortened to 20-40 days in\\nmoderate haemolysis and to 5-20 days in severe haemolysis.\\nI.

IMMUNOHAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIAS\\nImmunohaemolytic anaemias are a group of anaemias\\noccurring due to antibody production by the body againstits own red cells. Immune haemolysis in these cases may beinduced by one of the following three types of antibodies:\\n1.Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA)  characterised by\\nformation of autoantibodies against patient’s own red cells.\\nDepending upon the reactivity of autoantibody, AIHA isfurther divided into 2 types:\\ni)‘Warm’ antibody AIHA in which the autoantibodies are\\nreactive at body temperature (37°C).\\nii) ‘Cold’ antibody AIHA in which the autoantibodies react\\nbetter with patient’s own red cells at 4°C.\\n2.Drug-induced immunohaemolytic anaemia.\\n3.Isoimmune haemolytic anaemia  in which the antibodies are\\nacquired by blood transfusions, pregnancies and haemolytic\\ndisease of the newborn.\\nAn important diagnostic tool in all cases of immuno-\\nhaemolytic anaemias is Coombs’ antiglobulin test fordetection of incomplete Rh-antibodies in saline directly(direct Coombs’) or after addition of albumin (indirectCoombs’).\\nAutoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia (AIHA)\\n‘WARM’ ANTIBODY  AIHA\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Warm antibodies reactive at body\\ntemperature and coating the red cells are generally IgG class\\nantibodies and occasionally they are IgA. Little is knownabout the origin of these acquired red blood cell antibodiesin AIHA but the mechanism of destruction of red cells coatedwith IgG is better understood. Human red cells coated withIgG antibodies are bound to the surface of RE cells, especiallysplenic macrophages. A part of the coated cell membrane islost resulting in spherical transformation of the red cells(acquired spherocytosis). Red cells coated with IgG alongwith C3 on the surface further promote this red cell-leucocyteinteraction, accounting for more severe haemolysis. Thespleen is particularly efficient in trapping red cells coatedwith IgG antibodies. It is, thus, the major site of red celldestruction in warm antibody AIHA.\\nCLINICAL\\n FEATURES.  Warm antibody AIHA may occur\\nat any age and in either sex. The disease may occur without\\nany apparent cause (idiopathic) but about a quarter ofpatients develop this disorder as a complication of anunderlying disease affecting the immune system such as SLE,chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphomas and certaindrugs such as methyl DOPA, penicillin etc (Table 12.11).\\nThe disease tends to have remissions and relapses. The\\nusual clinical features are as follows:1. Chronic anaemia of varying severity with remissions and\\nrelapses.\\n2. Splenomegaly.\\n3. Occasionally hyperbilirubinaemia.\\nTreatment of these cases consists of removal of the cause\\nwhenever present, corticosteroid therapy, and in severe cases\\nblood transfusions. Splenectomy is the second line of therapyin this disorder.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS . The haematological and\\nbiochemical findings in such cases are as under:\\n1. Mild to moderate chronic anaemia.\\n2. Reticulocytosis.3. Prominent spherocytosis in the peripheral blood film.\\n4. Positive direct Coombs’ (antiglobulin) test for presence\\nof warm antibodies on the red cell, best detected at 37°C.\\n5. A positive indirect Coombs’ (antiglobulin) test at 37°C\\nmay indicate presence of large quantities of warmantibodies in the serum.\\n6. Unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinaemia.\\n7. Co-existent immune thrombocytopenia alongwith\\noccasional venous thrombosis may be present (termedEvans’ syndrome).\\n8. In more severe cases, haemoglobinaemia and\\nhaemoglobinuria may be present.\\n‘COLD’ ANTIBODY AIHA\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Antibodies which are reactive in the cold\\n(4°C) may induce haemolysis under 2 conditions: coldagglutinin disease and paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria.\\n1.Cold  agglutinin\\n disease.  In cold agglutinin disease, the\\nantibodies are IgM type which bind to the red cells best at\\n4°C. These cold antibodies are usually directed against the I\\nantigen on the red cell surface. Agglutination of red bloodcells by IgM cold agglutinins is most profound at very lowtemperature but upon warming to 37°C or above,disagglutination occurs quickly. Haemolytic effect ismediated through fixation of C3 to the red blood cell surfaceand not by agglutination alone. Most cold agglutinins affectjuvenile red blood cells.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 12.11: Conditions Predisposing to Autoimmune\\nHaemolytic Anaemia (AIHA).\\nA. WARM ANTIBODY AIHA\\n1. Idiopathic (primary)\\n2. Lymphomas-leukaemias e.g. non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,\\nCLL, Hodgkin's disease.\\n3. Collagen vascular diseases e.g SLE4. Drugs e.g. methyldopa, penicillin, quinidine group5. Post-viral\\nB. COLD ANTIBODY AIHA\\n1. Cold agglutinin diseasea) Acute: Mycoplasma  infection, infectious mononucleosis\\nb) Chronic: Idiopathic, lymphomas2. PCH ( Mycoplasma  infection, viral flu, measles, mumps,\\nsyphilis)313CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid SeriesThe etiology of cold antibody remains unknown. It is seen\\nin the course of certain infections (e.g. Mycoplasma\\npneumonia, infectious mononucleosis) and in lymphomas.\\n2. Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH).  In PCH, cold\\nantibody is an IgG antibody (Donath-Landsteiner antibody)\\nwhich is directed against P blood group antigen and brings\\nabout complement-mediated haemolysis. Attacks of PCH areprecipitated by exposure to cold.\\nPCH is uncommon and may be seen in association with\\ntertiary syphilis or as a complication of certain infections suchas Mycoplasma pneumonia, flu, measles and mumps.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations are due\\nto haemolysis and not due to agglutination. These includethe following:\\n1.Chronic anaemia which is worsened by exposure to cold.\\n2. Raynaud’s phenomenon.3. Cyanosis affecting the cold exposed regions such as tips\\nof nose, ears, fingers and toes.\\n4. Haemoglobinaemia and haemoglobinuria occur on\\nexposure to cold.\\nTreatment consists of keeping the patient warm and\\ntreating the underlying cause.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  The haematologic and\\nbiochemical findings are somewhat similar to those foundin warm antibody AIHA except the thermal amplitude.These findings are as follows:\\n1. Chronic anaemia.2. Low reticulocyte count since young red cells are affected\\nmore .\\n3. Spherocytosis is less marked.\\n4. Positive direct Coombs’ test for detection of C3 on the\\nred cell surface but IgM responsible for C3 coating on redcells is not found.\\n5. The cold antibody titre is very high at 4°C and very low\\nat 37°C (Donath-Landsteiner test). IgM class cold antibodyhas specificity for I antigen, while the rare IgG class\\nantibody of PCH has P blood group antigen specificity.\\nDrug-induced Immunohaemolytic Anaemia\\nDrugs may cause immunohaemolytic anaemia by 3 different\\nmechanisms:\\n1.ααα\\nαα-METHYL\\xa0 DOPA\\xa0TYPE\\xa0ANTIBODIES.  A small\\nproportion of patients receiving α-methyl dopa develop\\nimmunohaemolytic anaemia which is identical in every\\nrespect to warm antibody AIHA described above.\\n2. PENICILLIN-INDUCED\\xa0IMMUNOHAEMOLYSIS.\\nPatients receiving large doses of penicillin or penicillin-typeantibiotics develop antibodies against the red blood cell-drugcomplex which induces haemolysis.\\n3.INNOCENT\\xa0\\nBYSTANDER\\xa0IMMUNOHAEMOLYSIS.\\nDrugs such as quinidine form a complex with plasma\\nproteins to which an antibody forms. This drug-plasmaprotein-antibody complex may induce lysis of bystandingred blood cells or platelets.In each type of drug-induced immunohaemolytic\\nanaemia, discontinuation of the drug results in gradualdisappearance of haemolysis.\\nIsoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia\\nIsoimmune haemolytic anaemias are caused by acquiring\\nisoantibodies or alloantibodies by blood transfusions,pregnancies and in haemolytic disease of the newborn. Theseantibodies produced by one individual are directed againstred blood cells of the other. These conditions are consideredon page 340.\\nB. MICROANGIOPATHIC HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA\\nMicroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia is caused by\\nabnormalities in the microvasculature. It is generally due tomechanical trauma to the red cells in circulation and ischaracterised by red cell fragmentation (schistocytosis). Thereare 3 different ways by which microangiopathic haemolyticanaemia results:\\n1. EXTERNAL IMPACT.  Direct external trauma to red\\nblood cells when they pass through microcirculation, espe-\\ncially over the bony prominences, may cause haemolysisduring various activities e.g. in prolonged marchers, joggers,karate players etc. These patients develop haemoglobi-naemia, haemoglobinuria (march haemoglobinuria),  and\\nsometimes myoglobinuria as a result of damage to muscles.\\n2. CARDIAC HAEMOLYSIS.  A small proportion of\\npatients who received prosthetic cardiac valves or artificial\\ngrafts develop haemolysis. This has been attributed to directmechanical trauma to the red cells or shear stress fromturbulent blood flow.\\n3. FIBRIN DEPOSIT IN MICROVASCULATURE.\\nDeposition of fibrin in the microvasculature exposes the red\\ncells to physical obstruction and eventual fragmentation ofred cells and trapping of the platelets. Fibrin deposits in thesmall vessels may occur in the following conditions:i)Abnormalities of the vessel wall  e.g. in hypertension,\\neclampsia, disseminated cancers, transplant rejection,haemangioma etc.ii)Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.\\niii)Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.\\niv)Disseminated intravascular coagulation  (DIC)\\nv)Vasculitis in collagen diseases.\\nAll these conditions are described in relevant sections\\nseparately.\\nC. HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA FROM\\nDIRECT TOXIC EFFECTS\\nHaemolysis may result from direct toxic effects of certain\\nagents. These include the following examples:1.Malaria  by direct parasitisation of red cells (black-water\\nfever) (Fig.\\xa0 12.22).\\n2.Bartonellosis  by direct infection of red cells by the\\nmicroorganisms.3.Septicaemia  with Clostridium welchii  by damaging the red\\ncells.314SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\n4.Other microorganisms  such as pneumococci, staphylococci\\nand Escherichia coli.\\n5.Copper  by direct haemolytic effect on red cells in Wilson’s\\ndisease and patients on haemodialysis.\\n6.Lead poisoning  shows basophilic stippling of red blood\\ncells.7.Snake and spider bites  cause haemolysis by their venoms.\\n8.Extensive burns.\\nD. PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL\\nHAEMOGLOBINURIA (PNH)\\nPNH is a rare acquired disorder of red cell membrane inwhich there is chronic intravascular haemolysis due to unduesensitivity of red blood cells to complement due to defectivesynthesis of a red cell membrane protein. The defect affectsall the cells of myeloid progenitor lineage (RBCs, WBCs,platelets) suggesting a deficient haematopoiesis. The disordergenerally presents in adult life.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  PNH is considered as an acquired clonal\\ndisease of the cell membrane while normal clone also\\ncontinues to proliferate. The defect is a mutation in the stemcells affecting myeloid progenitor cells that is normallyrequired for the biosynthesis of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) essential for anchoring of the cell; the mutantform of the gene is an X-linked gene called PIG-A(phosphatidyl inositol glycan). Thus, as a result of mutation,there is partial or complete deficiency of anchor protein. Outof about 20 such proteins described so far, the lack of two ofthe proteins— decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) and a\\nmembrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL, CD59) , makes the\\nRBCs unduly sensitive to the lytic effect of complement.\\nCLINICAL AND LABORATORY FINDINGS.  Clinical\\nand laboratory findings are as under:\\ni)  Haemolytic anaemia.ii) Pancytopenia (mild granulocytopenia and thrombo-\\ncytopenia frequent).\\niii) Intermittent clinical haemoglobinuria; acute haemo-\\nlytic episodes occur at night identified by passage ofbrown urine in the morning.\\niv) Haemosiderinuria very common.\\nv) Venous thrombosis as a common complication.\\nThe presence of inordinate sensitivity of red blood cells,\\nleucocytes and platelets to complement in PNH can be\\ndemonstrated in vitro  by Ham’s test  using red cell lysis at\\nacidic pH or by sucrose haemolysis test.\\nAbout 20% cases of PNH may develop myeloproli-\\nferative or myelodysplastic disorder and some evendevelop acute myeloid leukaemia.\\nE. HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA IN SPLENOMEGALY\\nHaemolytic anaemia is common in splenic enlargement from\\nany cause (Chapter 14). Normally, the spleen acts as a filterand traps the damaged red blood cells, destroys them andthe splenic macrophages phagocytose the damaged red cells.A normal spleen poses no risk to normal red blood cells. Butsplenomegaly exaggerates the damaging effect to which thered cells are exposed. Besides haemolytic anaemia,splenomegaly is usually associated with pancytopenia.Splenectomy or reduction in size of spleen by appropriatetherapy relieves the anaemia as well as improves theleucocyte and platelet counts.\\nII. HEREDITARY (INTRACORPUSCULAR)\\n    HAEMOL YTIC ANAEMIA\\nHereditary haemolytic anaemias are usually the result ofintracorpuscular defects. Accordingly, they are broadlyclassified into 2 groups (see Table 12.9):\\nHereditary abnormalities of red cell membrane.\\nHereditary disorders of the interior of the red cells.\\nA. HEREDITARY ABNORMALITIES OF\\nRED CELL MEMBRANE\\nThe abnormalities of red cell membrane are readily identifiedon blood film examination. There are 3 important types ofinherited red cell membrane defects: hereditaryspherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis (hereditaryovalocytosis) and hereditary stomatocytosis.\\nHereditary Spherocytosis\\nHereditary spherocytosis is a common type of hereditary\\nhaemolytic anaemia of autosomal dominant inheritance inwhich the red cell membrane is abnormal.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The molecular abnormality in hereditary\\nspherocytosis is a defect in proteins which anchor the lipid\\nbilayer to the underlying cytoskeleton. These proteinabnormalities are as under and are schematically illustratedin Fig.12.23:\\n1. Spectrin\\xa0 deficiency.  Almost all cases have deficiency in\\nthe structural protein of the red cell membrane, spectrin.Figure 12.22 Malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , in the\\nperipheral blood showing numerous ring stages and a crescent of\\ngametocyte. The background shows a normoblast.\\n315CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\nSpectrin deficiency correlates with the severity of anaemia.\\nMutation in spectrin by recessive inheritance called  α−spectrin\\ncauses more severe form of anaemia, while mutation bydominant inheritance forming \\nβ-spectrin results in mild form\\nof the disease.\\n2. Ankyrin abnormality. About half the cases of hereditary\\nspherocytosis have defect in  ankyrin, protein that binds\\nprotein 3 and spectrin. Homozygous state with recessive\\ninheritance pattern has severe anaemia while heterozygoteswith more common dominant inheritance pattern havemilder anaemia.\\nInherited mutation in spectrin or ankyrin causes defect\\nin anchoring of lipid bilayer cell membrane. Red cells withsuch unstable membrane but with normal volume, whenreleased in circulation, lose their membrane further, till theycan accommodate the given volume. This results in formationof spheroidal contour and smaller size of red blood cells,termed microspherocytes . These deformed red cells are not\\nflexible, unlike normal biconcave red cells. These rigid cellsare unable to pass through the spleen, and in the processthey lose their surface membrane further. This produces asubpopulation of hyperspheroidal red cells in the peripheral\\nblood which are subsequently destroyed in the spleen.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES. The disorder may be clinically\\napparent at any age from infancy to old age and has equal\\nsex incidence. The family history may be present. The majorclinical features are as under:\\n1.Anaemia  is usually mild to moderate.\\n2.Splenomegaly  is a constant feature.\\n3.Jaundice  occurs due to increased concentration of\\nunconjugated (indirect) bilirubin in the plasma (also termed\\ncongenital haemolytic jaundice).\\n4.Pigment gallstones  are frequent due to increased bile\\npigment production. Splenectomy offers the only reliable\\nmode of treatment.LABORATORY  FINDINGS.  The usual haematological\\nand biochemical findings are as under:\\n1. Anaemia  of mild to moderate degree.\\n2. Reticulocytosis,  usually 5-20%.\\n3. Blood film shows the characteristic abnormality of\\nerythrocytes in the form of microspherocytes (Fig.12.24).\\n4. MCV is usually normal or slightly decreased but MCHC\\nis increased.\\n5. Osmotic fragility test is helpful in testing the spheroidal\\nnature of red cells which lyse more readily in solutions oflow salt concentration i.e. osmotic fragility is increased\\n(Fig.12.25).\\n6. Autohaemolysis test  is similar to osmotic fragility test after\\nincubation and shows increased spontaneous\\nautohaemolysis (10-15% red cells) as compared to normalred cells (less than 4%). Autohaemolysis is correctable byaddition of glucose.\\n7. Direct Coombs’ (antiglobulin) test is negative so as to\\ndistinguish this condition from acquired spherocytosis of\\nAIHA in which case it is positive.\\nSpherocytes may also be seen in blood film in acquired\\nimmune haemolytic anaemia and following red celltransfusion.\\nHereditary Elliptocytosis (Hereditary Ovalocytosis)\\nHereditary elliptocytosis or hereditary ovalocytosis is another\\nautosomal dominant disorder involving red cell membraneprotein spectrin.  Some patients have an inherited defect in\\nerythrocyte membrane protein 4.1 that interconnects spectrinwith actin in the cytoskeleton. The disorder is similar in allrespects to hereditary spherocytosis except that the bloodfilm shows oval or elliptical red cells and is clinically a milderdisorder than hereditary spherocytosis.\\nAcquired causes of elliptocytosis include iron deficiency\\nand myeloproliferative disorders.Figure 12.23 Diagrammatic representation of pathogenesis of hereditary spherocytosis. A, Normal red cell with biconcave surface and normal\\nsize. B, Red cell membrane as seen in cross section in hereditary spherocytosis. Mutations in membrane proteins— α-spectrin, β-spectrin and\\nankyrin, result in defect in anchoring of  lipid bilayer of the membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton. C, This results in sph erical contour and small\\nsize so as to contain the given volume of haemoglobin in the deformed red cell. D, During passage  through the spleen, these ri gid spherical cells\\nlose their cell membrane further. This produces a circulating subpopulation of hyperspheroidal spherocytes while splenic macrop hages in large\\nnumbers phagocytose defective red cells causing splenomegaly.\\n316SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues asymptomatic. Several variants of G6PD have been\\ndescribed. The normal G6PD variant is designated as type Bbut blacks have normally A+ (positive) type G6PD variant.The most common and significant clinical variant is A–(negative) type found in black males. Like the HbS gene, theA–type G6PD variant confers protection against malaria.Individuals with A– G6PD variant have shortened red celllifespan but without anaemia. However, these individualsdevelop haemolytic episodes on exposure to oxidant stresssuch as viral and bacterial infections, certain drugs(antimalarials, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, aspirin, vitaminK), metabolic acidosis and on ingestion of fava beans(favism).\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Normally, red blood cells are well\\nprotected against oxidant stress because of adequate\\ngeneration of reduced glutathione via the hexose mono -\\nphosphate shunt. \\xa0Individuals with inherited deficiency of\\nG6PD, an enzyme required for hexose monophosphateshunt for glucose metabolism, fail to develop adequatelevels of reduced glutathione in their red cells. This resultsFigure 12.24 Peripheral blood film findings in hereditary spherocytosis.\\nFigure 12.25 Osmotic fragility test in hereditary spherocytosis\\nshowing increased fragility.Hereditary Stomatocytosis\\nStomatocytes are cup-shaped RBCs having one surface\\nconcave and the other side as convex. This causes a centralslit-like or mouth-like appearance of red cells. The underlyingdefect is in membrane protein, stomatin, having autosomal\\ndominant pattern of inheritance. The stomatocytes areswollen red cells (overhydrated red cells) due to increasedpermeability to sodium and potassium. The affected patientshave mild anaemia and splenomegaly.\\nB. HEREDITARY DISORDERS OF RED CELL INTERIOR\\nInherited disorders involving the interior of the red blood\\ncells are classified into 2 groups:\\n1. Red\\xa0cell\\xa0enzyme\\xa0defects\\xa0(Enzymopathies):  These cause\\ndefective red cell metabolism involving 2 pathways\\n(Fig. 12.26):\\ni)Defects in the hexose monophosphate shunt: Common\\nexample is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)deficiency.\\nii)Defects in the Embden-Meyerhof (glycolytic) pathway:\\nExample is pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency.\\n2. Disorders of haemoglobin (haemoglobinopathies):\\nThese are divided into 2 subgroups:\\ni) Structurally abnormal haemoglobin: Examples are sickle\\nsyndromes and other haemoglobinopathies.\\nii)Reduced globin chain synthesis:  Common examples are\\nvarious types of thalassaemias.\\nThese disorders are discussed below.\\nRed Cell Enzyme Defects (Enzymopathies)\\nG6PD\\xa0 DEFICIENCY\\nAmong the defects in hexose monophosphate shunt, the most\\ncommon is G6PD deficiency. It affects millions of peoplethroughout the world. G6PD gene is located on the Xchromosome and its deficiency is, therefore, a sex (X)-linkedtrait affecting males, while the females are carriers and are\\n317CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\nin oxidation and precipitation of haemoglobin within the\\nred cells forming Heinz bodies. Besides G6PD deficiency,deficiency of various other enzymes involved in the hexosemonophosphate shunt may also infrequently cause clinicalproblems.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations are those\\nof an acute haemolytic anaemia within hours of exposure to\\noxidant stress. The haemolysis is, however, self-limiting evenif the exposure to the oxidant is continued since it affects the\\nolder red cells only . Haemoglobin level may return to normal\\nwhen the older population of red cells has been destroyedand only younger cells remain. Some patients may have onlydarkening of the urine from haemoglobinuria but moreseverely affected ones develop constitutional symptomsincluding jaundice. Treatment is directed towards theprevention of haemolytic episodes such as stoppage ofoffending drug. Blood transfusions are rarely indicated.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  These are as under:\\n1.During the period of acute haemolysis, there is rapid\\nfall in haematocrit by 25-30%, features of intravascularhaemolysis such as rise in plasma haemoglobin,haemoglobinuria, rise in unconjugated bilirubin and fallin plasma haptoglobin. Formation of Heinz bodies isvisualised by means of supravital stains such as crystalviolet, also called Heinz body haemolytic anaemia.  However,\\nHeinz bodies are not seen after the first one or two dayssince they are removed by the spleen, leading to formationof ‘bite cells’ and fragmented red cells.\\n2.\\xa0Between\\xa0the\\xa0crises,  the affected patient generally has\\nno anaemia. The red cell survival is, however, shortened.\\nThe diagnosis of G6PD enzyme deficiency is made by\\none of the screening tests (e.g. methaemoglobin reduction\\ntest, fluorescent screening test, ascorbate cyanidescreening test), or by direct enzyme assay on red cells.PK DEFICIENCY\\nPyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is the only significantenzymo pathy of the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic\\npathway. The disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive\\npattern. Heterozygote state is entirely asymptomatic, whilethe homozygous individual presents during early childhoodwith anaemia, jaundice and splenomegaly.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS:  These are as under:\\n1. Normocytic and normochromic anaemia.2. Reticulocytosis.3. Blood film shows bizarre red cells.4.  Osmotic fragility is usually normal but after incubation\\nit is increased.5. Autohaemolysis is increased, but unlike hereditaryspherocytosis, is not corrected by addition of glucose.6. Direct specific enzyme assay on red cells is the onlymethod of establishing the diagnosis.\\nHaemoglobinop\\nathies\\nHaemoglobin in RBCs may be abnormally synthesised dueto inherited defects. These disorders may be of two types:\\nQualitative disorders  in which there is structural\\nabnormality in synthesis of haemoglobin e.g. sickle cellsyndrome, other haemoglobinopathies.\\nQuantitative disorders  in which there quantitatively\\ndecreased globin chain synthesis of haemoglobin e.g.\\nthalassaemias.\\nBoth these groups of disorders may occur as homozygous\\nstate in which both genes coding for that character areabnormal, or heterozygous  when one gene is abnormal and\\nthe other gene is normal. However, there are examples of\\ncombined disorders too in which there are two different\\nmutations in loci of two corresponding genes (i.e. doubleheterozygous) e.g. HbS gene from one parent and β-thal from\\nthe other parent resulting in β\\nSβthal. These disorders may varyFigure 12.26 Abbreviated pathways of anaerobic glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof) and hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt in the metabolism\\nof erythrocyte. The two red cell enzyme defects, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase, are shown bold.\\n318SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissuesin presentation from asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities\\nto intrauterine death.\\nThere are geographic variations in the distribution of\\nvarious haemoglobinopathies world over as shown in\\nFig. 12.27.  Major examples of these disorders are described\\nbelow.\\nSTRUCTURALLY ABNORMAL HAEMOGLOBINS\\nSICKLE SYNDROMESThe most important and widely prevalent type of haemo-\\nglobinopathy is due to the presence of sickle haemoglobin(HbS) in the red blood cells. The red cells with HbS develop‘sickling’ when they are exposed to low oxygen tension.Sickle syndromes have the highest frequency in black raceand in Central Africa where falciparum malaria is endemic.Patients with HbS are relatively protected against falciparum\\nmalar ia. Sickle syndromes occur in 3 different forms:\\n1.As heterozygous state  for HbS: sickle cell trait (AS).\\n2.As homozygous state  for HbS: sickle cell anaemia (SS).\\n3.As double heterozygous states  e.g. sickle β-thalassaemia,\\nsickle-C disease (SC), sickle-D disease (SD).\\nHeterozygous State:Sickle Cell Trait\\nSickle cell trait (AS) is a benign heterozygous state of HbS in\\nwhich only one abnormal gene is inherited. Patients with\\nAS develop no significant clinical problems except when they\\nbecome severely hypoxic and may develop sickle cell crises.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  These patients have no\\nanaemia and have normal appearance of red cells. But in\\nhypoxic crisis, sickle cell crises develop. The diagnosis is\\nmade by 2 tests:\\n1.Demonstration of sickling  done under condition of\\nreduced oxygen tension by an oxygen consuming reagent,\\nsodium metabisulfite.\\n2.Haemoglobin electrophoresis  reveals 35-40% of the total\\nhaemoglobin as HbS.\\nHomozygous State:Sickle Cell Anaemia\\nSickle cell anaemia (SS) is a homozygous state of HbS in the\\nred cells in which an abnormal gene is inherited from each\\nparent. SS is a severe disorder associated with protean clinical\\nmanifestations and decreased life expectancy.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Following abnormalities are observed\\n(Fig. 12.28):\\n1.Basic molecular lesion:  In HbS, basic genetic defect is the\\nsingle point mutation  in one amino acid out of 146 in\\nhaemoglobin molecule— there is substitution of valine for\\nglutamic acid  at 6-residue position of the β-globin, producing\\nHb α\\n2β2s.Figure 12.27 The geographic distribution of major haemo-\\nglobinopathies and thalassaemias. Thalassaemia and HbD are the\\nhaemoglobin disorders common in India.\\nFigure 12.28 Pathogenesis of sickle cell anaemia. A, Basic molecular defect. B, Mechanism of polymerisation and consequent sickling of red\\ncells containing HbS. C, Mechanism of sickling on oxygenation-deoxygenation.\\n319CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series2.Mechanism of sickling:  During deoxygenation, the red\\ncells containing HbS change from biconcave disc shape to\\nan elongated crescent-shaped or sickle-shaped cell. Thisprocess termed sickling  occurs both within the intact red cells\\nand in vitro  in free solution. The mechanism responsible for\\nsickling upon deoxygenation of HbS-containing red cells isthe polymerisation of deoxygenated HbS which aggregatesto form elongated rod-like polymers. These elongated fibresalign and distort the red cell into classic sickle shape.\\n3.\\xa0Reversible-irreversible\\xa0sickling:  The oxygen-dependent\\nsickling process is usually reversible. However, damage to\\nred cell membrane leads to formation of irreversibly sickledred cells even after they are exposed to normal oxygentension.\\n4.Factors determining rate of sickling:  Following factors\\ndetermine the rate at which the polymerisation of HbS and\\nconsequent sickling take place:\\ni) Presence of non-HbS haemoglobins: The red cells in patients\\nof SS have predominance of HbS and a small part consists of\\nnon-HbS haemoglobins, chiefly HbF (2-20% of the totalhaemoglobin). HbF-containing red cells are protected fromsickling while HbA-containing red cells participate readilyin co-polymerisation with HbS.\\nii)Intracellular concentration of HbS.\\niii)Total haemoglobin concentration.\\niv)Extent of deoxygenation.\\nv)Acidosis and dehydration.\\nvi)Increased concentration of 2, 3-BPG in the red cells.\\nCLINICAL\\xa0FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations of homo-\\nzygous sickle cell disease are widespread. The symptoms\\nbegin to appear after 6th month of life when most of the HbFis replaced by HbS. Infection and folic acid deficiency resultin more severe clinical manifestations. These features are asunder:\\n1. Anaemia.  There is usually severe chronic haemolytic\\nanaemia (primarily extravascular) with onset of aplastic crisis\\nin between. The symptoms of anaemia are generally mildsince HbS gives up oxygen more readily than HbA to thetissues.\\n2. Vaso-occlusive phenomena.  Patients of SS develop\\nrecurrent vaso-occlusive episodes throughout their lives due\\nto obstruction to capillary blood flow by sickled red cellsupon deoxygenation or dehydration. Vaso-obstructionaffecting different organs and tissues results in infarcts whichmay be of 2 types:\\ni)Microinfarcts  affecting particularly the abdomen, chest,\\nback and joints and are the cause of recurrent painful crises\\nin SS.\\nii)Macroinfarcts  involving most commonly the spleen\\n(splenic sequestration, autosplenectomy), bone marrow\\n(pains), bones (aseptic necrosis, osteomyelitis), lungs(pulmonary infections), kidneys (renal cortical necrosis), CNS(stroke), retina (damage) and skin (ulcers), and result inanatomic and functional damage to these organs.\\n3.Constitutional\\xa0\\nsymptoms.  In addition to the features of\\nanaemia and infarction, patients with SS have impairedgrowth and development and increased susceptibility to\\ninfection due to markedly impaired splenic function.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS. The diagnosis of SS is\\nconsidered high in blacks with haemolytic anaemia. Thelaboratory findings in these cases are as under (Fig.\\xa012.29):\\n1. Moderate to severe anaemia (haemoglobin concen-tration 6-9 g/dl).\\n2. The blood film shows sickle cells and target cells and\\nfeatures of splenic atrophy such as presence of Howell-Jolly bodies.\\n3. A positive sickling test with a reducing substance such\\nas sodium metabisulfite (described above).\\n4. Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows no normal HbA\\nbut shows predominance of HbS and 2-20% HbF.\\nDouble Heterozygous States\\nDouble heterozygous conditions involving combination ofHbS with other haemoglobinopathies may occur. Mostcommon among these are sickle- β-thalassaemia ( β\\nSβthal),\\nsickle C disease (SC), and sickle D disease (SD). All thesedisorders behave like mild form of sickle cell disease. Theirdiagnosis is made by haemoglobin electrophoresis andseparating the different haemoglobins.\\nOTHER STRUCTURAL HAEMOGLOBINOPATHIES\\nBesides sickle haemoglobin, about 400 structurally different\\nabnormal human haemoglobins have been discovered indifferent parts of the world. Some of them are associated withclinical manifestations, while others are of no consequence.A few important and common variants are briefly describedbelow:\\nHbC\\xa0Haemoglobinopathy\\nHbC haemoglobinopathy is prevalent in West Africa and in\\nAmerican blacks. The molecular lesion in HbC is substitutionof lysine for glutamic acid at β-6 globin chain position. TheFigure 12.29 Sickle cell anaemia. PBF shows crescent shaped\\nelongated red blood cells, a few target cells and a few erythroblasts.\\n320SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissuesdisorder of HbC may occur as benign homozygous HbC\\ndisease, or as asymptomatic heterozygous HbC trait, or asdouble heterozygous combinations such as sickle-HbCdisease and HbC- β thalassaemia.\\nHbD Haemoglobinopathy\\nHbD occurs in North-West India, Pakistan and Iran. About3% of Sikhs living in Punjab are affected with HbDhaemoglobinopathy (called HbD Punjab,  also known as Hb-\\nLos Angeles). HbD Punjab arises from the substitution of\\nglutamine for glutamic acid at β-121 globin chain position.\\nHbE Haemoglobinopathy\\nHbE is predominantly found in South-East Asia, India,Burma and Sri Lanka. HbE arises from the substitution oflysine for glutamic acid at β-26 globin chain position. Like\\nother abnormal haemoglobins, HbE haemoglobinopathy mayalso occur as asymptomatic heterozygous HbE trait,compensated haemolytic homozygous HbE disease, or asdouble heterozygous states in combination with otherhaemoglobinopathies such as HbE- β thalassaemia and HbE-\\nα thalassaemia.\\nHaemoglobin O-Arab Disease\\nHb O-Arab disease was first identified in an Arab family\\nbut has now been detected in American blacks too. Thehomozygous form of the disease appears as mild haemolyticanaemia with splenomegaly.\\nUnstable-Hb Haemoglobinopathy\\nThe unstable haemoglobins are those haemoglobin variants\\nwhich undergo denaturation and precipitation within the redcells as Heinz bodies. These give rise to what is known ascongenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia  or congenital\\nHeinz body haemolytic anaemia.  These disorders have either\\nautosomal dominant inheritance or develop from sponta-neous mutations. The unstable haemoglobins arise fromeither a single amino acid substitution in the globin chain ordue to deletion of one or more amino acids within the β-\\nglobin chain so that the firm bonding of the haem groupwithin the molecule is disturbed leading to formation ofmethaemoglobin and precipitation of globin chains as Heinzbodies.\\nOver 100 unstable haemoglobins have been described.\\nThey are named according to the place where they areencountered. For instance: Hb-Koln, Hb-Hammersmith, Hb-Zurich, Hb-Sydney, and so on. The diagnosis of unstable Hbdisease is made by test for Heinz bodies and by haemoglobinelectrophoresis.\\nREDUCED GLOBIN CHAIN SYNTHESIS:\\nTHALASSAEMIAS\\nDEFINITION\\nThe thalassaemias are a diverse group of hereditary disorders\\nin which there is reduced synthesis of one or more of theglobin polypeptide chains. Thus, thalassaemias, unlikehaemoglobinopathies which are qualitative disorders ofhaemoglobin, are quantitative abnormalities of polypeptide globinchain synthesis.  Thalassaemias were first described in people\\nof Mediterranean countries (North Africa, Southern Europe)from where it derives its name ‘Mediterranean anaemia.’ TheWord ‘thalassa’  in Greek means ‘the sea’ since the condition\\nwas found commonly in regions surrounding theMediterranean sea. The condition also occurs in the MiddleEast, Indian subcontinent, South-East Asia and, in generalin blacks  (see Fig. 12.27).\\nGENETICS AND CLASSIFICATION\\nThalassaemias are genetically transmitted disorders.\\nNormally, an individual inherits two β-globin genes located\\none each on two chromosomes 11, and two α-globin genes\\none each on two chromosomes 16, from each parent i.e.normal adult haemoglobin (HbA) is α\\n2 β2*. Depending upon\\nwhether the genetic defect or deletion lies in transmission ofα- or β-globin chain genes, thalassaemias are classified into\\nα- and β- thalassaemias. Thus, patients with α-thalassaemia\\nhave structurally normal α-globin chains but their production\\nis impaired. Similarly, in β-thalassaemia, β-globin chains are\\nstructurally normal but their production is decreased. Eachof the two main types of thalassaemias may occur asheterozygous (called α- and β-thalassaemia minor  or trait),  or\\nas homogygous state (termed α- and β-thalassaemia major).\\nThe former is generally asymptomatic, while the latter is asevere congenital haemolytic anaemia.\\nA classification of various types of thalassaemias\\nalongwith the clinical syndromes produced and salientlaboratory findings are given in Table 12.12.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ANAEMIA INTHALASSAEMIA\\nA constant feature of all forms of thalassaemia is the presence\\nof anaemia which occurs from following mechanisms:\\nα-Thalassaemia:  In α-thalassaemia major, the obvious cause\\nof anaemia is the inability to synthesise adult haemoglobin,\\nwhile in α-thalassaemia trait there is reduced production of\\nnormal adult haemoglobin.\\nβ-Thalassaemia:  In β-thalassaemia major, the most impor-\\ntant cause of anaemia is premature red cell destruction\\nbrought about by erythrocyte membrane damage caused bythe precipitated α-globin chains. Other contributory factors\\nare: shortened red cell lifespan, ineffective erythropoiesis,and haemodilution due to increased plasma volume. Adeficiency of β-globin chains in β-thalassaemia leads to large\\nexcess of α-chains within the developing red cells. Part of\\nthese excessive α-chains are removed by pairing with γ-globin\\nchains as HbF, while the remainder unaccompanied α-chains\\nprecipitate rapidly within the red cell as Heinz bodies . The\\nprecipitated α-chains cause red cell membrane damage.\\nDuring their passage through the splenic sinusoids, thesered cells are further damaged and develop pitting due toremoval of the precipitated aggregates. Thus, such red cells\\n*In a normal adult, distribution of haemoglobin is as under: HbA ( α2β2 )\\n= 95-98%, HbA2 (α2δ2) (a minor variant of HbA) = 1.5-3.5%, HbF ( α2 γ2) =\\nless than 1%.  But the level of HbF in children under 6 months is slightly\\nhigher.321CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Seriesare irreparably damaged and are phagocytosed by the RE\\ncells of the spleen and the liver causing anaemia, hepato-splenomegaly, and excess of tissue iron stores. Patients withβ-thalassaemia minor, on the other hand, have very mild\\nineffective erythropoiesis, haemolysis and shortening of redcell lifespan.\\nα αα αα-THALASSAEMIA\\nMOLECULAR\\xa0 PATHOGENESIS.  α-thalassaemias are\\ndisorders in which there is defective synthesis of α-globin\\nchains resulting in depressed production of haemoglobins\\nthat contain α-chains i.e. HbA, HbA\\n2 and HbF. The α-\\nthalassaemias are most commonly due to deletion of one ormore of the α-chain genes located on short arm of chromo-\\nsome 16. Since there is a pair of α-chain genes, the clinical\\nmanifestations of α-thalassaemia depend upon the number\\nof genes deleted. Accordingly, α-thalassaemias are classified\\ninto 4 types:1. Four α-gene deletion: Hb Bart’s hydrops foetalis.\\n2. Three α-gene deletion: HbH disease.\\n3. Two α-gene deletion: α-thalassaemia trait.\\n4. One α-gene deletion: α-thalassaemia trait (carrier).\\nHb Bart’s Hydrops Foetalis\\nWhen there is deletion of all the four α-chain genes\\n(homozygous state) it results in total suppression of α-globin\\nchain synthesis causing the most severe form of α-\\nthalassaemia called Hb Bart’s hydrops foetalis. Hb Bart’s is\\na gamma globin chain tetramer ( γ\\n4) which has high oxygen\\naffinity leading to severe tissue hypoxia.\\nCLINICAL\\xa0FEATURES.  Hb Bart’s hydrops foetalis is\\nincompatible with life due to severe tissue hypoxia. The\\ncondition is either fatal in utero  or the infant dies shortly after\\nbirth. If born alive, the features similar to severe Rhhaemolytic disease are present (page 340).\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  Infants with Hb Bart’s\\nhydrops foetalis born alive may have the followinglaboratory findings:1. Severe anaemia (haemoglobin below 6g/dl).\\n2. Blood film show marked anisopoikilocytosis,\\nhypochromia, microcytosis, polychromasia, basophilicstippling, numerous normoblasts and target cells.3. Reticulocyte count is high.4.Serum bilirubin level is elevated.\\n5\\n. Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows 80-90% Hb-Bart’s\\nand a small amount of Hb-H and Hb-Portland but noHbA, HbA\\n2 or HbF.\\nHbH Disease\\nDeletion of three α-chain genes produces HbH which is a β-\\nglobin chain tetramer ( β4) and markedly impaired α-chain\\nsynthesis. HbH is precipitated as Heinz bodies within the\\naffected red cells. An elongated α-chain variant of HbH\\ndisease is termed Hb Constant Spring.\\nCLINICAL\\xa0FEATURES.  HbH disease is generally present\\nas a well-compensated haemolytic anaemia. The features areintermediate between that of β -thalassaemia minor and\\nmajor. The severity of anaemia fluctuates and may fall tovery low levels during pregnancy or infections. Majority ofpatients have splenomegaly and may develop cholelithiasis.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  These are as follows:\\n1.Moderate anaemia (haemoglobin 8-9 g/dl).\\n2. Blood film shows severe microcytosis, hypochromia,basophilic stippling, target cells and normoblasts.3. Mild reticulocytosis.\\n4. HbH inclusions as Heinz bodies can be demonstrated\\nin mature red cells with brilliant cresyl blue stain.\\n5.Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows 2-4% HbH and\\nthe remainder consists of HbA, HbA\\n2 and HbF.\\nα αα αα-Thalassaemia Trait\\nα-thalassaemia trait may occur by the following molecular\\npathogenesis:\\nBy deletion of two of the four α-chain genes in\\nhomozygous form called homozygous α-thalassaemia,  or in\\ndouble heterozygous form termed heterozygous α-thalassaemia .\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 12.12: Classification of Thalassaemias.\\nType Hb Hb-electrophoresis Genotype Clinical Syndrome\\nα-THALASSAEMIAS\\n1.Hydrops foetalis 3-10 gm/dl Hb Barts (g4) (100%) Deletion of four α-genes Fatal in utero  or in early infancy\\n2.Hb-H disease 2-12 gm/dl HbF (10%), HbH (2-4%) Deletion of three α-genes Haemolytic anaemia\\n3.α-Thalassaemia trait 10-14 gm/dl Almost normal Deletion of two α-genes Microcytic hypochromic blood\\npicture but no anaemia\\nβ-THALASSAEMIAS\\n1.β-Thalassaemia major < 5 gm/dl HbA (0-50%), βthal/βthalSevere congenital haemolytic\\nHbF(50-98%) anaemia, requires blood transfusions\\n2.β-Thalassaemia intermedia 5-10 gm/dl Variable Multiple mechanisms Severe anaemia, but regular blood\\ntransfusions not required\\n3.β-Thalassaemia minor 10-12 gm/dl HbA2 (4-9%) βA/βthalUsually asymptomatic\\nHbF (1-5%)322SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular TissuesBy deletion of a single α-chain gene causing heterozygous\\nα-thalassaemia trait called heterozygous α-thalassaemia.\\nCLINICAL\\xa0FEATURES.  α-thalassaemia trait due to two\\nα-chain gene deletion is asymptomatic. It is suspected in a\\npatient of refractory microcytic hypochromic anaemia in\\nwhom iron deficiency and β-thalassaemia minor have been\\nexcluded and the patient belongs to the high-risk ethnicgroup. One gene deletion α-thalassaemia trait is a silent\\ncarrier state.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  The patients of α-thalas-\\nsaemia trait may have the following haematologicalfindings:\\n1. Haemoglobin level normal or mildly reduced.\\n2. Blood film shows microcytic and hypochromic red cell\\nmorphology but no evidence of haemolysis or anaemia.\\n3. MCV, MCH and MCHC may be slightly reduced.4. Haemoglobin electrophoresis reveals small amount of\\nHb-Bart’s in neonatal period (1-2% in α-thalassaemia 2\\nand 5-6% in α-thalassaemia 1) which gradually disappears\\nby adult life. HbA\\n2 is either normal or slightly decreased\\n(contrary to the elevated HBA2 levels in β-thalassaemia\\ntrait).\\nβ ββ ββ-THALASSAEMIAS\\nMOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS.  β-thalassaemias are\\ncaused by decreased rate of β-chain synthesis resulting in\\nreduced formation of HbA in the red cells. The molecularpathogenesis of the β-thalassaemias is more complex than\\nthat of α-thalassaemias. In contrast to α-thalassaemia, gene\\ndeletion rarely ever causes β-thalassaemia and is only seen\\nin an entity called hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin\\n(HPFH). Instead, most of β -thalassaemias arise from different\\ntypes of mutations of β−globin gene resulting from single\\nbase changes. The symbol β° is used to indicate the complete\\nabsence of β-globin chain synthesis while β\\n+ denotes partial\\nsynthesis of the β-globin chains. More than 100 such\\nmutations have been described affecting the preferred sitesin the coding sequences e.g. in promoter region, terminationregion, splice junctions, exons, introns. Some of the importantones having effects on β-globin chain synthesis are as under\\n(Fig.\\xa012.30):\\ni) Transcription defect: Mutation affecting transcriptional\\npromoter sequence causing reduced synthesis of β-globin\\nchain. Hence the result is partially preserved synthesis i.e.\\nβ+ thalassaemia .ii) Translation defect:  Mutation in the coding sequence causing\\nstop codon (chain termination) interrupting β-globin\\nmessenger RNA. This would result in no synthesis of β-globin\\nchain i.e. β° thalassaemia.\\niii)mRNA splicing defect:  Mutation leads to defective mRNA\\nprocessing forming abnormal mRNA that is degraded in the\\nnucleus. Depending upon whether part of splice site remainsintact or is totally degraded, it may result in \\nβ+ thalassaemia\\nor β° thalassaemia .\\nDepending upon the extent of reduction in β-chain\\nsynthesis, there are 3 types of β-thalassaemia:\\n1. Homozygous\\xa0form:\\xa0 β-Thalassaemia\\xa0major.\\xa0 It is the most\\nsevere form of congenital haemolytic anaemia. It is furtherof 2 types (Fig.\\xa012.31):\\ni)β° thalassaemia major  characterised by complete absence\\nof β-chain synthesis.\\nii)β\\n+ thalassaemia major  having incomplete suppression of\\nβ-chain synthesis.\\n2.β-Thalassaemia\\xa0intermedia:  It is β-thalassaemia of\\nintermediate degree of severity that does not require regularblood transfusions. These cases are genetically heterozygous(β°/β or β\\n+/β).\\n3. Heterozygous\\xa0form:\\xa0 β-Thalassaemia\\xa0minor\\xa0(trait).  It is\\na mild asymptomatic condition in which there is moderatesuppression of β-chain synthesis.\\nBesides β-thalassaemia minor, a few uncommon globin\\nchain combinations resulting in β-thalassaemia trait are as\\nunder:\\ni)δβ-thalassaemia minor  in which there is total absence of\\nboth β and δ chain synthesis and is characterised by elevated\\nHbF level but unlike β-thalassaemia minor there is normal\\nor reduced HbA\\n2 level.Figure 12.30 Schematic representation of sites of β-globin gene\\nmutation in chromosome 11 giving rise to β-thalassaemia.Figure 12.31 Pathogenesis of β-thalassaemia major.\\n323CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series\\nii)Hb Lepore syndrome  characterised by nonhomologous\\nfusion of β- and δ-genes forming an abnormal haemoglobin\\ncalled Hb Lepore (named after a family called Lepore). There\\nis total absence of normal β-chain synthesis.\\nAn individual may inherit one β-chain gene from each\\nparent and produce heterozygous, homozygous, or doubleheterozygous states. Statistically, 25% of offsprings born totwo heterozygotes (i.e. β-thalassaemia trait) will have the\\nhomozygous state i.e. β-thalassaemia major.β ββ ββ-Thalassaemia Major\\nβ-thalassaemia major, also termed Mediterranean or Cooley’s\\nanaemia is the most common form of congenital haemolyticanaemia. β-thalassaemia major is a homozygous state with\\neither complete absence of β-chain synthesis ( β° thalassaemia\\nmajor)  or only small amounts of β-chains are formed ( β\\n+ thalas-\\nsaemia major).  These result in excessive formation of alternate\\nhaemoglobins, HbF ( α2 γ2) and HbA2 (α2 δ2).\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinical manifestations appear\\ninsidiously and are as under (Fig. 12.32):\\n1. Anaemia starts appearing within the first 4-6 months oflife when the switch over from γ-chain to β-chain production\\noccurs.\\n2. Marked hepatosplenomegaly occurs due to excessive red\\ncell destruction, extramedullary haematopoiesis and iron\\noverload.\\n3. Expansion of bones occurs due to marked erythroid\\nhyperplasia leading to thalassaemic facies and malocclusionof the jaw.\\n4. Iron overload due to repeated blood transfusions causes\\ndamage to the endocrine organs resulting in slow rate ofgrowth and development, delayed puberty, diabetes mellitusand damage to the liver and heart.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  The haematological\\ninvestigations reveal the following findings:\\n1. Anaemia,  usually severe.\\n2. Blood film  shows severe microcytic hypochromic red cell\\nmorphology, marked anisopoikilocytosis, basophilic\\nstippling, presence of many target cells, tear drop cellsand normoblasts (Fig. 12.33).\\n3. Serum bilirubin  (unconjugated) is generally raised.\\n4. Reticulocytosis  is generally present.\\n5. MCV, MCH and MCHC  are significantly reduced.\\n6. WBC count is  often raised with some shift to left of the\\nneutrophil series, with presence of some myelocytes andmetamyelocytes.Figure 12.32 Major clinical features of β -thalassaemia major.\\nFigure 12.33 Peripheral blood film findings in β-thalassaemia major.\\n324SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues7. Platelet count  is usually normal but may be reduced in\\npatients with massive splenomegaly.\\n8. Osmotic fragility characteristically reveals increased\\nresistance to saline haemolysis i.e. decreased osmotic fragility\\n(Fig.\\xa012.34).\\n9. Haemoglobin electrophoresis  shows presence of increased\\namounts of HbF, increased amount of HbA2, and almost\\ncomplete absence or presence of variable amounts of HbA.\\nThe increased level of HbA2 has not been found in any\\nother haemoglobin abnormality except β-thalassaemia.\\nThe increased synthesis of HbA2 is probably due to\\nincreased activity at both δ-chain loci.\\n10. Bone marrow aspirate examination  shows normoblastic\\nerythroid hyperplasia with predominance of intermediateand late normoblasts which are generally smaller in sizethan normal. Iron staining demonstrates siderotic granulesin the cytoplasm of normoblasts, increased reticuloendo-thelial iron but ring sideroblasts are only occasionally seen.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of β-thalassaemia major is largely supportive.\\n1.Anaemia is generally severe and patients require regular\\nblood transfusions (4-6 weekly) to maintain haemoglobin\\nabove 8 g/dl.\\n2. In order to maintain increased demand of hyperplastic\\nmarrow, folic acid supplement is given.\\n3. Splenectomy is beneficial in children over 6 years of age\\nsince splenic sequestration contributes to shortened red celllifespan.\\n4. Prevention and treatment of iron overload is done by\\nchelation therapy (desferrioxamine). Oral chelation withkelfer or deferiprone is also available now.\\n5. Bone marrow transplantation from HLA-matched donor\\nthat provides stem cells which can form normal haemoglobinis being done in many centres with fair success rate, especiallywhen done at an early stage before end-organ damage hassupervened..\\n6. Some workers have found success with cord blood\\ntransfusion.7. Ge ne therapy of thalasaemia involving genetic\\nmanipulation in haematopoieitc stem cells may become an\\noption  for future.\\nSince these patients require multiple blood transfusions,\\nthey are at increased risk of developing AIDS. In general,\\npatients with β-thalassaemia major have short life\\nexpectancy. The biggest problem is iron overload and conse-quent myocardial siderosis leading to cardiac arrhythmias,congestive heart failure, and ultimately death.\\nβ ββ ββ-Thalassaemia Minor\\nThe β-thalassaemia minor or β-thalassaemia  trait, a\\nheterozygous state, is a common entity characterised bymoderate reduction in β-chain synthesis.\\nCLINICAL\\xa0FEATURES.  Clinically, the condition is usually\\nasymptomatic and the diagnosis is generally made when thepatient is being investigated for mild chronic anaemia. Thespleen may be palpable.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  These are as under:\\n1. Mild anaemia;  mean haemoglobin level is about 15%\\nlower than in normal person for the age and sex.\\n2. Blood film  shows mild anisopoikilocytosis, microcytosis\\nand hypochromia, occasional target cells and basophilic\\nstippling.\\n3. Serum bilirubin  may be normal or slightly raised.\\n4. Mild reticulocytosis is often present.\\n5. MCV, MCH and MCHC  may be slightly reduced.\\n6. Osmotic fragility test shows increased resistance to\\nhaemolysis i.e. decreased osmotic fragility.\\n7. Haemoglobin electrophoresis  is confirmatory for the\\ndiagnosis and shows about two-fold increase in HbA\\n2 and\\na slight elevation in HbF (2-3%).\\nTreatment\\nPatients with β-thalassaemia minor do not require any\\ntreatment. But they should be explained about the genetic\\nimplications of the disorder, particularly to those of child-bearing age. If the two subjects of β-thalassaemia trait marry,\\nthere is a 25% chance of developing thalassaemia major in\\noffsprings. Patients with β-thalassaemia minor have normal\\nlife expectancy but those who are treated under the mistaken\\ndiagnosis of iron deficiency may develop siderosis and itscomplications.\\nPrevention of Thalassaemia\\nFinally, since thalassaemia is an inheritable disease, its\\nprevention is possible by making an antenatal diagnosis. This\\nis done by chorionic villous biopsy or cells obtained by\\namniocentesis and foetal DNA studied by PCR amplificationtechnique for presence of genetic mutations of thalassaemias.\\nAPLASTIC ANAEMIA AND OTHER\\nPRIMAR Y BONE MARROW DISORDERS\\n‘Bone marrow failure’  is the term used for primary disorders\\nof the bone marrow which result in impaired formation of\\nthe erythropoietic precursors and consequent anaemia. Itincludes the following disorders:1.Aplastic anaemia,  most importantly.Figure 12.34 Osmotic fragility testing  β-thalassaemia major\\nshowing decreased fragility.\\n325CHAPTER 12 Introduction to Haematopoietic System and Disorders of Erythroid Series2. Other primary bone marrow disroders  such as: myelophthisic\\nanaemia, pure red cell aplasia, and myelodysplastic\\nsyndromes.\\nThese disorders are examples of hypoproliferative\\nanaemias in which anaemia is not the only finding but the\\nmajor problem is pancytopenia i.e. anaemia, leucopenia and\\nthrombocytopenia. While myelodysplastic syndromes are\\ndiscussed in Chapter 14, other conditions are considered\\nbelow.\\nAPLASTIC ANAEMIA\\nAplastic anaemia is defined as pancytopenia (i.e.\\nsimultaneous presence of anaemia, leucopenia and\\nthrombocytopenia) resulting from aplasia of the bonemarrow. The underlying defect in all cases appears to besufficient reduction in the number of haematopoietic\\npluripotent stem cells which results in decreased or total\\nabsence of these cells for division and differentiation.\\nETIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION.  Based on the\\netiology, aplastic anaemia is classified into 2 main types:\\nprimary and secondary. Various causes that may give rise\\nto both these types of aplastic anaemia are summarised inTable\\xa012.13  and briefly considered below:\\nA. Primary\\xa0aplastic\\xa0anaemia.  Primary aplastic anaemia\\nincludes 2 entities: a congenital form called Fanconi’sanaemia and an immunologically-mediated acquired form.\\n1. Fanconi’s anaemia.  This has an autosomal recessive\\ninheritance and is often associated with other congenital\\nanomalies such as skeletal and renal abnormalities, andsometimes mental retardation.\\n2.Immune causes.  In many cases, suppression of haemato-\\npoietic stem cells by immunologic mechanisms may cause\\naplastic anaemia. The observations in support of autoimmune\\nmechanisms are the clinical response to immuno-suppressive therapy and in vitro  marrow culture experiments.\\nB\\n. Secondary\\xa0aplastic\\xa0anaemia.  Aplastic anaemia may occur\\nsecondary to a variety of industrial, physical, chemical,iatrogenic and infectious causes:\\n1. Drugs.  A number of drugs are cytotoxic to the marrow\\nand cause aplastic anaemia. The association of a drug with\\naplastic anaemia may be either predictably dose-related oran idiosyncratic reaction.Dose-related aplasia  of the bone marrow occurs with\\nantimetabolites (e.g. methotrexate), mitotic inhibitors (e.g.\\ndaunorubicin), alkylating agents (e.g. busulfan), nitroso urea\\nand anthracyclines. In such cases, withdrawal of the drugusually allows recovery of the marrow elements.\\nIdiosyncratic aplasia  is depression of the bone marrow due\\nto qualitatively abnormal reaction of an individual to a drug\\nwhen first administered. The most serious and most common\\nexample of idiosyncratic aplasia is associated withchloramphenicol. Other such common drugs are sulfa drugs,oxyphenbutazone, phenylbutazone, chlorpromazine, gold\\nsalts etc.\\n2.Toxic chemicals.  These include examples of industrial,\\ndomestic and accidental use of substances such as benzene\\nderivatives, insecticides, arsenicals etc.\\n3.Infections.  Aplastic anaemia may occur following viral\\nhepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus infection, AIDS and other viral\\nillnesses.\\n4.Miscellaneous.  Lastly, aplastic anaemia has been reported\\nin association with certain other illnesses such as SLE, and\\nwith therapeutic X-rays.\\nCLINICAL\\xa0FEATURES.  The onset of aplastic anaemia may\\noccur at any age and is usually insidious. The clinical\\nmanifestations include the following:\\n1. Anaemia and its symptoms like mild progressive\\nweakness and fatigue.\\n2. Haemorrhage from various sites due to thrombo-cytopenia such as from the skin, nose, gums, vagina, bowel,\\nand occasionally in the CNS and retina.\\n3.Infections of the mouth and throat are commonly present.\\n4\\n. The lymph nodes, liver and spleen are generally not\\nenlarged.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  The diagnosis of aplastic\\nanaemia is made by a thorough laboratory evaluation andexcluding other causes of pancytopenia (Table 12.14).  The\\nfollowing haematological features are found:\\n1.\\xa0Anaemia.  Haemoglobin levels are moderately reduced.\\nThe blood picture generally shows normocytic\\nnormochromic anaemia but sometimes macrocytosis may\\nbe present. The reticulocyte count is reduced or zero.\\n2.\\xa0Leucopenia.  The absolute granulocyte count is\\nparticularly low (below 1500/ μl) with relative lympho-\\ncytosis. The neutrophils are morphologically normal but\\ntheir alkaline phosphatase score is high.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 12.13: Causes of Aplastic Anaemia.\\nA.

Myelofibrosis326SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues3.Thrombocytopenia.  Platelet count is always reduced.\\n4.Bone marrow examination.  A bone marrow aspirate\\nmay yield a ‘dry tap’. A trephine biopsy is generally\\nessential for making the diagnosis which reveals patchycellular areas in a hypocellular or aplastic marrow due toreplacement by fat. There is usually a severe depression\\nof myeloid cells, megakaryocytes and erythroid cells so\\nthat the marrow chiefly consists of lymphocytes andplasma cells (Fig.12.35).  Haematopoieitc stem cells\\nbearing CD34 marker are markedly reduced or absent.\\nTreatment\\nThe patients of mild aplasia may show spontaneous recovery,\\nwhile the management of severe aplastic anaemia is a mostchallenging task. In general, younger patients show betterresponse to proper treatment. The broad outlines of the\\ntreatment are as under:\\nA. General management:  It consists of the following:\\n1. Identification and elimination of the possible cause.\\n2. Supportive care consisting of blood transfusions, platelet\\nconcentrates, and treatment and prevention of infections.\\nB. Specific treatment:  The specific treatment has been\\nattempted with varying success and includes the following:\\n1.Marrow stimulating agents  such as androgen may be\\nadministered orally.\\n2.Immunosuppressive therapy  with agents such as anti-\\nthymocyte globulin and anti-lymphocyte serum has been\\ntried with 40-50% success rate. Very high doses ofglucocorticoids or cyclosporine may yield similar responses.But splenectomy does not have any role in the management\\nof aplastic anaemia.\\n3.Bone marrow transplantation  is considered in severe cases\\nunder the age of 40 years where the HLA and mixed culture-\\nmatched donor is available. ( Other indications  for bonemarrow transplantation are: acute leukaemias—AML in firstremission and ALL in second remission, thalassaemia major\\nand combined immunodeficiency disease). Complications of\\nbone marrow transplantation such as severe infections, graftrejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) may occur(Chapter 4).\\nSevere aplastic anaemia is a serious disorder terminating\\nin death within 6-12 months in 50-80% of cases. Death isusually due to bleeding and/or infection.\\nMYELOPHTHISIC ANAEMIA\\nDevelopment of severe anaemia may result from infiltration\\nof the marrow termed as myelophthisic anaemia. The causesfor marrow infiltrations include the following (Table12.14):\\nHaematologic malignancies (e.g. leukaemia, lymphoma,\\nmyeloma).\\nMetastatic deposits from non-haematologic malignancies\\n(e.g. cancer breast, stomach, prostate, lung, thyroid).\\nAdvanced tuberculosis.\\nPrimary lipid storage diseases (Gaucher’s and Niemann-\\nPick’s disease).\\nOsteopetrosis and myelofibrosis may rarely cause\\nmyelophthisis.\\nThe type of anaemia in myelophthisis is generally\\nnormocytic normochromic with some fragmented red cells,\\nbasophilic stippling and normoblasts in the peripheral blood.\\nThrombocytopenia is usually present but the leucocyte countis increased with slight shift-to-left of myeloid cells i.e. apicture of leucoerythroblastic reaction  consisting of immature\\nmyeloid cells and normoblasts is seen in the peripheral blood.Treatment consists of reversing the underlying pathologicprocess.\\nPURE RED CELL APLASIA\\nPure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare syndrome involving a\\nselective failure in the production of erythroid elements inthe bone marrow but with normal granulopoiesis and mega-\\nkaryocytopoiesis. Patients have normocytic normochromic\\nanaemia with normal granulocyte and platelet count.Reticulocytes are markedly decreased or are absent.\\nPRCA exists in the following forms:\\nTransient self-limited PRCA:  It is due to temporary marrow\\nfailure in aplastic crisis in haemolytic anamias and in acuteB19 parvovirus infection and in transient erythroblastopeniain normal children.\\nAcquired PRCA:  It is seen in middle-aged adults in asso-\\nciation with some other diseases, most commonly thymoma;\\nothers are connective tissue diseases (SLE, rheumatoid\\narthritis), lymphoid malignancies (lymphoma, T-cellchronic lymphocytic leukaemia) and solid tumours.\\n Chronic B19 parvovirus infections:  PRCA may occur from\\nchronic B19 parvovirus infection in children and is commonand treatable. B19 parvovirus produces cytopathic effects onthe marrow erythroid precursor cells and are charac-teristically seen as giant pronomoblasts.\\nCongenital PRCA (Blackfan-Diamond syndrome)  is a rare\\nchronic disorder detected at birth or in early childhood. It\\noccurs due to mutation in a ribosomal RNA processing genetermed as RPS19 . The disorder is corrected by glucocorticoids\\nand marrow transplantation.\\n❑Figure 12.35 Bone marrow trephine biopsy in aplastic anaemia\\ncontrasted against normal cellular marrow. A, normal  marrow biopsy\\nshows about 50% fatty spaces and about 50% is haematopoietic marrowwhich contains a heterogeneous mixture of myeloid, erythroid andlymphoid cells. B, In aplastic anaemia, the biopsy shows suppression ofmyeloid and erythroid cells and replacement of haematopoetic elementsby fat. There are scanty foci of cellular components composed chiefly oflymphoid cells.\\n327CHAPTER 13 Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicine\\nDisorders of Platelets,\\nBleeding Disorders and\\nBasic Transfusion MedicineChapter 13Chapter 13\\nTHROMBOPOIESIS\\nAs outlined in previous chapter and illustrated in Fig. 12.3,\\nthe trilineage myeloid stem cells in the bone marrowdifferentiate into erythroid progenitor, granulocyte-monocyte progenitor, and megakaryocyte progenitor cells.Platelets are formed in the bone marrow by a process offragmentation of the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes. Plateletproduction is under the control of thrombopoietin, the natureand origin of which are not yet established. The stages inplatelet production are: megakaryoblast, promegakaryocyte,megakaryocyte, and discoid platelets (Fig. 13.1).\\nMEGAKARYOBLAST.  The earliest precursor of platelets\\nin the bone marrow is megakaryoblast. It arises fromhaematopoietic stem cell by a process of differentiation.\\nPROMEGAKARYOCYTE.  A megakaryoblast undergoes\\nendo-reduplication of nuclear chromatin i.e. nuclear\\nchromatin replicates repeatedly in multiples of two withoutdivision of the cell. Ultimately, a large cell containing up to32 times the normal diploid content of nuclear DNA(polyploidy) is formed when further nuclear replicationceases and cytoplasm becomes granular.\\nMEGAKARYOCYTE.  A mature megakaryocyte is a large\\ncell, 30-90 μm in diameter, and contains 4-16 nuclear lobes\\nhaving coarsely clumped chromatin. The cytoplasm is\\nabundant, light blue in colour and contains red-purplegranules. Platelets are formed from pseudopods ofmegakaryocyte cytoplasm which get detached into the bloodstream. Each megakaryocyte may form up to 4000 platelets.The formation of platelets from the stem cell takes about10 days.\\nPLATELETS.  Platelets are small (1-4 μm in diameter),\\ndiscoid, non-nucleate structures containing red-purple\\ngranules. The normal platelet count ranges from 150,000-400,000/ μl and the lifespan of platelets is 7-10 days. About\\n70% of platelets are in circulation while remaining 30% liesequestered in the spleen. Newly-formed platelets spend24-36 hours in the spleen before being released intocirculation but splenic stasis does not cause any injury to theplatelets normally. Factors such as stress, epinephrine andexercise stimulate platelet production.\\nThe main  functions  of platelets is in haemostasis which\\nincludes two closely linked processes:\\n1. Primary haemostasis.  This term is used for platelet plug\\nformation at the site of injury. It is an immediate phenomenon\\nappearing within seconds of injury and is responsible forcessation of bleeding from microvasculature. Primaryhaemostasis involves three steps: platelet adhesion, plateletgranule release and platelet aggregation which are regulatedby changes in membrane phospholipids, and calcium\\n(Fig. 13.2).  At molecular level, these important events are\\ndepicted diagrammatically in Fig. 13.3 and briefly outlined\\nbelow:\\nFigure 13.1 Thrombopoiesis.\\n328SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular TissuesPlatelet adhesion:  Platelets adhere to collagen in the\\nsubendothelium due to presence of receptor on platelet\\nsurface, glycoprotein (Gp) Ia-IIa which is an integrin. Theadhesion to the vessel wall is further stabilised by vonWillebrand factor, an adhesion glycoprotein. This is achievedby formation of a link between von Willebrand factor andanother platelet receptor, GpIb-IX complex.\\nPlatelet release:  After adhesion, platelets become\\nactivated and release three types of granules from theircytoplasm: dense granules, α-granules and lysosomal\\nvesicles. Important products released from these granulesare: ADP, ATP, calcium, serotonin, platelet factor 4, factorV, factor VIII, thrombospondin, platelet-derived growthfactor (PDGF), von Willebrand factor (vWF), fibronectin,fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor –1 (PAI-1) andthromboxane A2.\\nPlatelet aggregation:  This process is mediated by fibrinogen\\nwhich forms bridge between adjacent platelets viaglycoprotein receptors on platelets, GpIIb-IIIa.\\n2. Secondary haemostasis.  This involves plasma coagu-\\nlation system resulting in fibrin plug formation and takes\\nseveral minutes for completion. This is discussed in detail inChapter 5.\\nBLEEDING DISORDERS\\n(HAEMORRHAGIC DIATHESIS)\\nBleeding disorders or haemorrhagic diatheses are a groupof disorders characterised by defective haemostasis withabnormal bleeding. The tendency to bleeding may bespontaneous  in the form of small haemorrhages into the skin\\nand mucous membranes (e.g. petechiae, purpura,ecchymoses), or there may be excessive external or internalbleeding following trivial trauma  and surgical procedure (e.g.\\nhaematoma, haemarthrosis etc).\\nThe causes of haemorrhagic diatheses may or may not\\nbe related to platelet abnormalities. These causes are broadlydivided into the following groups:\\nI. Haemorrhagic diathesis due to vascular abnormalities.\\nII. Haemorrhagic diathesis related to platelet abnormalities.\\nIII. Disorders of coagulation factors.IV. Haemorrhagic diathesis due to fibrinolytic defects.\\nV. Combination of all these as occurs in disseminated\\nintravascular coagulation (DIC).\\nBefore discussing the bleeding disorders, it is considered\\ndesirable to briefly review the broad outlines of scheme ofinvestigations to be carried out in such a case.\\nINVESTIGATIONS OF HAEMOSTATIC FUNCTION\\nNormal haemostatic mechanism and thrombogenesis were\\ndiscussed in Chapter 5. In general, the haemostaticmechanisms have 2 primary functions:\\nTo promote local haemostasis  at the site of injured blood\\nvessel.\\nTo ensure that the circulating blood remains in fluid state\\nwhile in the vascular bed i.e. to prevent the occurrence ofgeneralised thrombosis.\\nFormation of haemostatic plug is a complex mechanism\\nand involves maintenance of a delicate balance among at least5 components  (Fig. 13.4):  (i) blood vessel wall; (ii) platelets;\\n(iii) plasma coagulation factors; (iv) inhibitors; and (v) fibrino-lytic system.\\nAnything that interferes with any of these components\\nresults in defective haemostasis with abnormal bleeding. Inorder to establish a definite diagnosis in any case suspectedto have abnormal haemostatic functions, the followingscheme is followed:\\nA. Comprehensive clinical evaluation,  including the patient’s\\nhistory, family history and details of the site, frequency and\\ncharacter of haemostatic defect.\\nB.\\nSeries of screening tests  for assessing the abnormalities in\\nvarious components involved in maintaining haemostatic\\nbalance.\\nC.Specific tests  to pinpoint the cause.\\nA brief review of general principles of tests used to\\ninvestigate haemostatic abnormalities is presented below and\\nsummarised in Table 13.1.\\nA. Investigation of Disordered V ascular Haemost\\nasis\\nDisorders of vascular haemostasis may be due to increasedvascular permeability, reduced capillary strength and failureFigure 13.2 Main events in primary haemostasis—platelet adhesion,\\nrelease (activation) and aggregation.\\nFigure 13.3 Molecular mechanisms in platelet adhesion and release\\nreaction (Gp = glycoprotein).\\n329CHAPTER 13 Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicineto contract after injury. Tests of defective vascular function\\nare as under:\\n1. BLEEDING TIME.  This simple test is based on the\\nprinciple of formation of haemostatic plug following a\\nstandard incision on the volar surface of the forearm and thetime the incision takes to stop bleeding is measured. The testis dependent upon capillary function as well as on plateletnumber and ability of platelets to adhere to form aggregates.Normal range is 3-8 minutes. A prolonged bleeding time maybe due to following causes:i)Thrombocytopenia.\\nii)\\nDisorders of platelet function.\\niii) von Willebrand’s disease.iv) Vascular abnormalities (e.g. in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).v) Severe deficiency of factor V and XI.\\n2. HESS CAPILLARY RESISTANCE TEST (TOURNI-\\nQUET TEST).  This test is done by tying sphygmomanometer\\ncuff to the upper arm and raising the pressure in it betweendiastolic and systolic for 5 minutes. After deflation, thenumber of petechiae appearing in the next 5 minutes in3 cm\\n2 area over the cubital fossa are counted. Presence of\\nmore than 20 petechiae is considered a positive test. The testis positive in increased capillary fragility as well as inthrombocytopenia.\\nB. Investigation of Platelets and Platelet Function\\nHaemostatic disorders are commonly due to abnormalities\\nin platelet number, morphology or function.\\n1. SCREENING TESTS.  The screening tests carried out for\\nassessing platelet-related causes are as under:\\ni)Peripheral blood platelet count.\\nii)\\nSkin bleeding time.\\niii) Examination of fresh blood film to see the morphologic\\nabnormalities of platelets.\\n2. SPECIAL TESTS.  If these screening tests suggest a\\ndisorder of platelet function, the following platelet function\\ntests may be carried out:\\ni)Platelet adhesion tests  such as retention in a glass bead\\ncolumn, and other sophisticated techniques.\\nii)Aggregation tests  which are turbidometric techniques\\nusing ADP, collagen or ristocetin.iii)Granular content  of the platelets and their release can be\\nassessed by electron microscopy or by measuring the\\nsubstances released.\\niv)Platelet coagulant activity  is measured indirectly by\\nprothrombin consumption index.\\nC. Investigation of Blood Coagulation\\nThe normal blood coagulation system consists of cascade of\\nactivation of 13 coagulation factors. These form intrinsic,extrinsic and common pathways which culminate information of thrombin that acts on fibrinogen to producefibrin.

The process of\\nfibrinolysis or clot dissolution and the role of platelets inactivation of cascade and formation of haemostatic plug are\\nillustrated in Fig. 13.5.\\n1.SCREENING TESTS.  Tests for blood coagulation sys-\\ntem include a battery of screening tests. These are as under:\\nI. Whole blood coagulation time.  The estimation of whole\\nblood coagulation time done by various capillary and tube\\nmethods is of limited value since it is an insensitive andnonspecific test. Normal range is 4-9 minutes at 37°C.\\nII.Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or partial\\nthromboplastin time with kaolin (PTTK) . This test is used\\nto measure the intrinsic system factors (VIII, IX, XI and XII)\\nas well as factors common to both intrinsic and extrinsic\\nsystems (factors X, V, prothrombin and fibrinogen). The test\\nconsists of addition of 3 substances to the plasma—calcium,phospholipid and a surface activator such as kaolin. Thenormal range is 30-40 seconds. The common causes of a\\nprolonged PTTK (or APTT) are as follows:\\ni)\\nParenteral administration of heparin.\\nii) Disseminated intravascular coagulation.iii) Liver disease.\\niv) Circulating anticoagulants.III.One-stage prothrombin time (PT).  PT measures the\\nextrinsic system factor VII as well as factors in the common\\npathway. In this test, tissue thromboplastin (e.g. brain extract)and calcium are added to the test. The normal PT in this testis 10-14 seconds. The common causes of prolonged one-stagePT are as under:i) Administration of oral anticoagulant drugs.ii) Liver disease, especially obstructive liver disease.iii) Vitamin K deficiency.iv) Disseminated intravascular coagulation.\\nIV.  Measurement of fibrinogen. The screening tests  for\\nfibrinogen deficiency are semiquantitative fibrinogen titre\\nand thrombin time (TT). The normal value of thrombin timeis under 20 seconds, while a fibrinogen titre in plasmadilution up to 32 is considered normal.  Following are thecommon causes for higher values in both these tests:\\ni) Hypofibrinogenaemia (e.g. in DIC).ii) Raised concentration of FDP.iii) Presence of heparin.\\n2. SPECIAL TESTS.  In the presence of an abnormality in\\nscreening tests, detailed investigations for the possible cause\\nare carried out. These include the following:\\ni) Coagulation factor assays.  These bioassays are based on\\nresults of PTTK or PT tests and employ the use of substrateFigure 13.5 Pathways of blood coagulation, fibrinolytic system and participation of platelets in activation of the cascade and their role i n\\nhaemostatic plug formation.\\n331CHAPTER 13 Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicineplasma that contains all other coagulation factors except the\\none to be measured. The unknown level of the factor activityis compared with a standard control plasma with a knownlevel of activity. Results are expressed as percentage ofnormal activity.\\nii) Quantitative assays.  The coagulation factors can be\\nquantitatively assayed by immunological and other chemical\\nmethods.\\nD. Investigation of Fibrinolytic System\\nIncreased levels of circulating plasminogen activator are\\npresent in patients with hyperfibrinolysis. Followingscreening tests  are done to assess these abnormalities in\\nfibrinolytic system:1.Estimation of fibrinogen.\\n2.Fibrin degradation products (FDP) in the serum.\\n3.\\nEthanol gelation test.\\n4. Euglobin or whole blood lysis time.\\nMore specific tests  include: functional assays, immuno-\\nlogical assays by ELISA, and chromogenic assays ofplasminogen activators, plasminogen, plasminogen activatorinhibitor, and FDP.\\nWith this background knowledge on work up of a case\\nof haemostatic abnormality, we now turn to discuss thecommon specific haemorrhagic disorders under thefollowing headings:I. Haemostatic diatheses due to vascular disorders.II. Haemostatic diatheses due to platelet disorders.III. Coagulation disorders.IV. Haemostatic diatheses due to fibrinolytic defects.V. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\\nHAEMORRHAGIC DIATHESES DUE TO\\nVASCULAR DISORDERS\\nVascular bleeding disorders, also called non-thrombo-cytopenic purpuras or vascular purpuras, are normally mildand characterised by petechiae, purpuras or ecchymosesconfined to the skin and mucous membranes. Thepathogenesis of bleeding is poorly understood since majorityof the standard screening tests of haemostasis including thebleeding time, coagulation time, platelet count and plateletfunction, are usually normal. Vascular purpuras arise fromdamage to the capillary endothelium, abnormalities in thesubendothelial matrix or extravascular connective tissue thatsupports the blood vessels, or from formation of abnormalblood vessels.\\nVascular bleeding disorders may be inherited or acquired.\\nA.\\nInherited Vascular Bleeding Disorders\\nA few examples of hereditary vascular disorders are givenbelow:\\n1. Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-\\nRendu disease).  This is an uncommon inherited autosomal\\ndominant disorder. The condition begins in childhood andis characterised by abnormally telangiectatic (dilated)capillaries. These telangiectasias develop particularly in theskin, mucous membranes and internal organs and are thesource of frequent episodes of bleeding from the nose andgastrointestinal tract.\\n2. Inherited disorders of connective tissue matrix.  These\\ninclude Marfan’s syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and\\npseudoxanthoma elasticum, all of which have inheriteddefect in the connective tissue matrix and, thus, have fragileskin vessels and easy bruising.\\nB. Acquired Vascular Bleeding Disorders\\nSeveral acquired conditions are associated with vascular\\npurpuras. These are as under:\\n1. Henoch-Schönlein purpura.  Henoch-Schönlein or\\nanaphylactoid purpura is a self-limited type of hyper-\\nsensitivity vasculitis occurring in children and young adults.Circulating immune complexes are deposited in the vesselwall consisting of IgA, C3 and fibrin, and in some cases,properdin suggesting activation of alternate complementpathway as the trigger event. The hypersensitivity vasculitisproduces purpuric rash on the extensor surfaces of arms, legsand on the buttocks, as well as haematuria, colickyabdominal pain due to bleeding into the GIT, polyarthralgiaand acute nephritis. In spite of these haemorrhagic features,all coagulation tests are normal.\\n2. Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.  Haemolytic-uraemic\\nsyndrome is a disease of infancy and early childhood in which\\nthere is bleeding tendency and varying degree of acute renalfailure. The disorder remains confined to the kidney wherehyaline thrombi are seen in the glomerular capillaries.\\n3. Simple easy bruising (Devil’s pinches).  Easy bruising\\nof unknown cause is a common phenomenon in women of\\nchild-bearing age group.\\n4. Infection.  Many infections cause vascular haemorrhages\\neither by causing toxic damage to the endothelium or by DIC.\\nThese are especially prone to occur in septicaemia and severemeasles.\\n5. Drug reactions.  Certain drugs form antibodies and\\nproduce hypersensitivity (or leucocytoclastic) vasculitis\\nresponsible for abnormal bleeding.\\n6. Steroid purpura.  Long-term steroid therapy or Cushing’s\\nsyndrome may be associated with vascular purpura due to\\ndefective vascular support.\\n7. Senile purpura.  Atrophy of the supportive tissue of\\ncutaneous blood vessels in old age may cause senile atrophy,\\nespecially in the dorsum of forearm and hand.\\n8. Scurvy.  Deficiency of vitamin C causes defective colla-\\ngen synthesis which causes skin bleeding as well as bleeding\\ninto muscles, and occasionally into the gastrointestinal andgenitourinary tracts.\\nHAEMORRHAGIC DIATHESES DUE TO\\nPLATELET DISORDERS\\nDisorders of platelets produce bleeding disorders by one ofthe following 3 mechanisms:\\nA.Due to reduction in the number of platelets  i.e. various forms\\nof thrombocytopenias.332SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular TissuesB.Due to rise in platelet count  i.e. thrombocytosis.\\nC.Due to defective platelet functions.\\nA. THROMBOCYTOPENIAS\\nThrombocytopenia is defined as a reduction in the peripheral\\nblood platelet count below the lower limit of normal i.e. below150,000/ μl. Thrombocytopenia is associated with abnormal\\nbleeding that includes spontaneous skin purpura andmucosal haemorrhages as well as prolonged bleeding aftertrauma. However, spontaneous haemorrhagic tendencybecomes clinically evident only after severe depletion of theplatelet count to level below 20,000/ μl.\\nThrombocytopenia may result from 4 main groups of\\ncauses:\\n1.Impaired platelet production.\\n2.Accelerated platelet destruction.\\n3.\\nSplenic sequestration.\\n4. Dilutional loss.\\nA list of causes of thrombocytopenia is given in\\nTable 13.2.  Three of the common and important causes—\\ndrug-induced thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocyto-\\npenic purpura (ITP), and thrombotic thrombocytopenicpurpura (TTP), are discussed below.\\nDrug-induced Thrombocytopenia\\nMany commonly used drugs cause thrombocytopenia by\\ndepressing megakaryocyte production. In most cases, animmune mechanism by formation of drug-antibody comp-lexes is implicated in which the platelet is damaged as an‘innocent bystander’. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia isassociated with many commonly used drugs and includes:chemotherapeutic agents (alkylating agents, anthracyclines,antimetabolites), certain antibiotics (sulfonamides, PAS,rifampicin, penicillins), drugs used in cardiovascular diseases(digitoxin, thiazide diuretics), diclofenac, acyclovir, heparinand excessive consumption of ethanol.\\nClinically, the patient presents with acute purpura. The\\nplatelet count is markedly lowered, often below 10,000/ μl\\nand the bone marrow shows normal or increased number ofmegakaryocytes.\\nThe immediate treatment is to stop or replace the\\nsuspected drug with instruction to the patient to avoid takingthe offending drug in future. Occasional patients may requiretemporary support with glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis orplatelet transfusions.\\nHeparin-induced Thrombocytopenia\\nThrombocytopenia due to administration of heparin is\\ndistinct from that caused by other drugs in following ways:i) Thrombocytopenia is generally not so severe to fall to levelbelow 20,000/ μl.\\nii) Unlike drug-induced thrombocytopenia, heparin-inducedthrombocytopenia is not associated with bleeding but insteadthese patients are more prone to develop thrombosis.\\nThe underlying mechanism of heparin-induced\\nthrombocytopenia is formation of antibody against plateletfactor 4 (PF-4)-heparin complex. This specific antibodyactivates the endothelial cells and initiates thrombusformation. It occurs in a small proportion of cases after thepatient has received heparin for 5-10 days.\\nDiagnosis is made by a combination of laboratory and\\nclinical features with 4 Ts: thrombocytopenia, thrombosis,\\ntime of fall of platelet count, absence of other causes ofthrombocytopenia.\\nImmune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)\\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune\\nthrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), is characterised byimmunologic destruction of platelets and normal or increasedmegakaryocytes in the bone marrow.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  On the basis of duration of illness, ITP is\\nclassified into acute and chronic forms, both of which have\\ndifferent pathogenesis.\\nAcute ITP. This is a self-limited disorder, seen most\\nfrequently in children following recovery from a viral illness(e.g. hepatitis C, infectious mononucleosis, CMV infection,HIV infection) or an upper respiratory illness. The onset ofacute ITP is sudden and severe thrombocytopenia butrecovery occurs within a few weeks to 6 months. Themechanism of acute ITP is by formation of immune complexes\\ncontaining viral antigens, and by formation of  antibodies\\nagainst viral antigens which crossreact with platelets andlead to their immunologic destruction.\\nChronic ITP.  Chronic ITP occurs more commonly in adults,\\nparticularly in women of child-bearing age (20-40 years). The\\ndisorder develops insidiously and persists for several years.Though chronic ITP is idiopathic, similar immunologicthrombocytopenia may be seen in association with SLE, AIDSand autoimmune thyroiditis. The pathogenesis of chronic ITP\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 13.2: Causes of Thrombocytopenia.\\nI. IMPAIRED PLATELET PRODUCTION\\n1.Generalised bone marrow failure e.g.\\nAplastic anaemia, leukaemia, myelofibrosis, megaloblastic\\nanaemia, marrow infiltrations (carcinomas, lymphomas, multiple\\nmyeloma, storage diseases).\\n2.Selective suppression of platelet production e.g.\\nDrugs (quinine, quinidine, sulfonamides, PAS, rifampicin,\\nanticancer drugs, thiazide diuretics), (heparin, diclofenac,\\nacyclovir),  alcohol intake.\\nII.\\nACCELERATED PLATELET DESTRUCTION\\n1.Immunologic thrombocytopenias e.g.\\nITP (acute and chronic), neonatal and post-transfusion\\n(isoimmune), drug-induced, secondary immune ‘thrombo-cytopenia (post-infection, SLE, AIDS, CLL, lymphoma).\\n2.Increased consumption e.g.\\nDIC, TTP, giant haemangiomas, microangiopathic haemolytic\\nanaemia.\\nIII.SPLENIC SEQUESTRATION\\nSplenomegaly\\nIV. DILUTIONAL LOSS\\nMassive transfusion of old stored blood to bleeding patients.333CHAPTER 13 Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicine\\nis explained by formation of anti-platelet autoantibodies,\\nusually by platelet-associated IgG humoral antibodies\\nsynthesised mainly in the spleen. These antibodies aredirected against target antigens on the platelet glycoproteins,Gp IIb-IIIa and Gp Ib-IX complex. Some of the antibodiesdirected against platelet surface also interfere in theirfunction. The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar tothat seen in autoimmune haemolytic anaemias. Sensitisedplatelets are destroyed mainly in the spleen and renderedsusceptible to phagocytosis by cells of the reticuloendothelialsystem.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestation of ITP\\nmay develop abruptly in cases of acute ITP, or the onset may\\nbe insidious as occurs in majority of cases of chronic ITP.The usual manifestations are petechial haemorrhages, easybruising, and mucosal bleeding such as menorrhagia inwomen, nasal bleeding, bleeding from gums, melaena andhaematuria. Intracranial haemorrhage is, however, rare.Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly may occur in cases withchronic ITP but lymphadenopathy is quite uncommon ineither type of ITP.LABORATORY FINDINGS.  The diagnosis of ITP can be\\nsuspected on clinical features after excluding the knowncauses of thrombocytopenia and is supported by thefollowing haematologic findings:\\n1.Platelet count  is markedly reduced, usually in the range\\nof 10,000-50,000/ μl.\\n2.Blood film  shows only occasional platelets which are\\noften large in size (Fig. 13.6,A).\\n3.Bone marrow  shows increased number of mega-\\nkaryocytes which have large non-lobulated single nuclei\\nand may have reduced cytoplasmic granularity andpresence of vacuoles (Fig. 13.6, B).\\n4. With sensitive techniques, anti-platelet IgG antibody  can\\nbe demonstrated on platelet surface or in the serum ofpatients.\\n5.Platelet survival studies  reveal markedly reduced platelet\\nlifespan, sometimes less than one hour, as compared with\\nnormal lifespan of 7-10 days.\\nTREATMENT.  Spontaneous recovery occurs in 90% cases\\nof acute ITP, while only less than 10% cases of chronic ITPFigure 13.6 Laboratory findings of ITP contrasted with those found\\nin a normal individual. A, Peripheral blood in ITP shows presence of\\nreduced number of platelets which are often large. B, Bone marrow inITP shows characteristically increased number of megakaryocytes withsingle non-lobulated nuclei and reduced cytoplasmic granularity (inbox\\non right photomicrograph).\\n334SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissuesrecover spontaneously. Treatment is directed at reducing the\\nlevel and source of autoantibodies and reducing the rate of\\ndestruction of sensitised platelets. This is possible by\\ncorticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive drugs (e.g.vincristine, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) andsplenectomy. Beneficial effects of splenectomy in chronic ITP\\nare due to both removal of the major site of platelet\\ndestruction and the major source of autoantibody synthesis.Platelet transfusions are helpful as a palliative measure onlyin patients with severe haemorrhage.\\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) and\\nHaemolytic-Uraemic Syndrome (HUS)\\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and haemo-\\nlytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) are a group of thrombotic\\nmicroangiopathies which are essentially characterised by\\ntriad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia\\nand formation of hyaline fibrin microthrombi  within the micro-\\nvasculature throughout the body. These are often fulminant\\nand lethal disorders occurring in young adults. The intra-\\nvascular microthrombi are composed predominantly ofplatelets and fibrin. The widespread presence of these plateletmicrothrombi is responsible for thrombocytopenia due to\\nincreased consumption of platelets, microangiopathic haemo-\\nlytic anaemia and protean clinical manifestations involvingdifferent organs and tissues throughout the body.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Unlike DIC, a clinicopathologically\\nrelated condition, activation of the clotting system is not the\\nprimary event in formation of microthrombi. TTP is initiatedby endothelial injury followed by release of von Willebrandfactor and other procoagulant material from endothelial cells,\\nleading to the formation of microthrombi. Trigger for the\\nendothelial injury comes from immunologic damage bydiverse conditions such as in pregnancy, metastatic cancer,high-doze chemotherapy, HIV infection, and mitomycin C.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations of TTP\\nare due to microthrombi in the arterioles, capillaries and\\nvenules throughout the body. Besides features of thrombo-cytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia,characteristic findings include fever, transient neurologic\\ndeficits and renal failure. The spleen may be palpable.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  The diagnosis can be made\\nfrom the following findings:\\n1. Thrombocytopenia.\\n2. Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia with negative\\nCoombs’ test.\\n3. Leucocytosis, sometimes with leukaemoid reaction.4. Bone marrow examination reveals normal or slightly\\nincreased megakaryocytes accompanied with somemyeloid hyperplasia.\\n5. Diagnosis is, however, established by examination of\\nbiopsy (e.g. from gingiva) which demonstrates typicalmicrothrombi in arterioles, capillaries and venules,unassociated with any inflammatory changes in the vesselwall.B.  THROMBOCYTOSIS\\nThrombocytosis is defined as platelet count in excess of\\n4,00,000/ μl. While essential or primary thrombocytosis or\\nthrombocythaemia is discussed under myeloproliferativedisorders in the next chapter, secondary or reactivethrombocytosis can occur following massive haemorrhage,iron deficiency, severe sepsis, marked inflammation,disseminated cancers, haemolysis, or following splenectomy.Thrombocytosis causes bleeding or thrombosis but how itproduces is not clearly known.\\nAs such, transitory and secondary thrombocytisis does\\nnot require any separate treatment other than treating thecause.\\nC. DISORDERS OF PLATELET FUNCTIONS\\nDefective platelet function is suspected in patients who show\\nskin and mucosal haemorrhages and have prolongedbleeding time but a normal platelet count. These disordersmay be hereditary or acquired.\\nHereditary Disorders\\nDepending upon the predominant functional abnormality,\\ninherited disorders of platelet functions are classified intothe following 3 groups:\\n1. DEFECTIVE PLATELET ADHESION.  These are as\\nunder:\\ni)Bernard-Soulier syndrome  is an autosomal recessive\\ndisorder with inherited deficiency of a platelet membrane\\nglycoprotein which is essential for adhesion of platelets tovessel wall.\\nii)In von Willebrand’s disease, there is defective platelet\\nadhesion as well as deficiency of factor VIII (page 336).\\n2. DEFECTIVE PLATELET AGGREGATION.  In thromba-\\nsthenia (Glanzmann’s disease), there is failure of primary\\nplatelet aggregation with ADP or collagen due to inheriteddeficiency of two of platelet membrane glycoproteins.\\n3. DISORDERS OF PLATELET RELEASE REACTION.\\nThese disorders are characterised by normal initialaggregation of platelets with ADP or collagen but thesubsequent release of ADP, prostaglandins and 5-HT isdefective due to complex intrinsic deficiencies.\\nAcquired Disorders\\nAcquired defects of platelet functions include the following\\nclinically significant examples:\\n1. ASPIRIN THERAPY.  Prolonged use of aspirin leads to\\neasy bruising and abnormal bleeding time. This is because\\naspirin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, and therebysuppresses the synthesis of prostaglandins which areinvolved in platelet aggregation as well as release reaction.The anti-platelet effect of aspirin is clinically applied inpreventing major thromboembolic disease in recurrentmyocardial infarction.\\n2. OTHERS.  Several other acquired disorders are associated\\nwith various abnormalities in platelet functions at different335CHAPTER 13 Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicinelevels. These include: uraemia, liver disease, multiple\\nmyeloma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia and variousmyeloproliferative disorders.\\nCOAGULATION DISORDERS\\nThe physiology of normal coagulation is described in Chapter\\n5 together with relatively more common coagulationdisorders of arterial and venous thrombosis and embolism.A deficiency of each of the thirteen known plasmacoagulation factors has been reported, which may beinherited or acquired. In general, coagulation disorders areless common as compared with other bleeding disorders. Thetype of bleeding in coagulation disorders is different fromthat seen in vascular and platelet abnormalities. Instead ofspontaneous appearance of petechiae and purpuras, theplasma coagulation defects manifest more often in the formof large ecchymoses, haematomas and bleeding into muscles,joints, body cavities, GIT and urinary tract. For establishingthe diagnosis, screening tests for coagulation  (whole blood\\ncoagulation time, bleeding time, activated partialthromboplastin time and prothrombin time) are carried out,followed by coagulation factor assays  as discussed already on\\npage 330.\\nDisorders of plasma coagulation factors may have here-\\nditary or acquired origin.\\nHEREDITARY COAGULATION DISORDERS.  Most of the\\ninherited plasma coagulation disorders are due to qualitative\\nor quantitative defect in a single coagulation factor. Out ofdefects in various coagulation factors, two of the mostcommon inherited coagulation disorders are the sex-(X)-linked disorders— classic haemophilia or haemophilia A  (due to\\ninherited deficiency of factor VIII), and Christmas disease or\\nhaemophilia B  (due to inherited deficiency of factor IX).\\nAnother common and related coagulation disorder, von\\nWillebrand’s disease  (due to inherited defect of von\\nWillebrand’s factor), is also discussed here.\\nACQUIRED COAGULATION DISORDERS. The acquired\\ncoagulation disorders, on the other hand, are usually\\ncharacterised by deficiencies of multiple coagulation factors.The most common acquired clotting abnormalities are:vitamin K deficiency, coagulation disorder in liver diseases,fibrinolytic defects and disseminated intravascularcoagulation (DIC).\\nThe more common of the hereditary and acquired\\ncoagulation disorders are discussed below.\\nClassic Haemophilia (Haemophilia A)\\nClassic haemophilia or haemophilia A is the second most\\ncommon hereditary coagulation disorder next to vonWillebrand’s disease occurring due to deficiency or reducedactivity of factor VIII (anti-haemophilic factor). The disorderis inherited as a sex-(X-) linked recessive trait and, therefore,manifests clinically in males, while females are usually thecarriers. However, occasional women carriers of haemophiliamay produce factor VIII levels far below 50% and becomesymptomatic carriers, or rarely there may be true femalehaemophilics arising from consanguinity within the family(i.e. homozygous females). The chances of a proven carriermother passing on the abnormality to her children is 50:50for each son and 50:50 for each daughter. A haemophilicfather will have normal sons as they inherit his Y chromo-some only that does not carry the genetic abnormality.\\nThe disease has been known since ancient times but\\nSchönlein in 1839 gave this bleeder’s disease its present namehaemophilia. In 1952, it was found that haemophilia was notalways due to deficiency of factor VIII as was previouslyconsidered but instead blood of some patients was deficientin factor IX (Christmas factor or plasma thromboplastincomponent). Currently, haemophilia A (classic haemophilia)  is\\nthe term used for the disorder due to factor VIII deficiency,and haemophilia B (Christmas disease)  for the disorder when\\nfactor IX is deficient.\\nThe frequency of haemophilia varies in different races,\\nthe highest incidence being in populations of Britain,Northern Europe and Australia. Western literature reportsgive an overall incidence of haemophilia in 1 in 10,000 malebirths. Another interesting facet of the haemophilia whichhas attracted investigators and researchers is the occurrenceof this disorder in the blood of royal families in GreatBritain and some European countries.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Haemophilia A is caused by quantitative\\nreduction of factor VIII in 90% of cases, while 10% cases have\\nnormal or increased level of factor VIII with reduced activity.Factor VIII is synthesised in hepatic parenchymal cells andregulates the activation of factor X in intrinsic coagulationpathway. Factor VIII circulates in blood complexed to anotherlarger protein, von Willebrand’s factor (vWF), whichcomprises 99% of the factor VIII-vWF complex. The geneticcoding, synthesis and functions of vWF are different fromthose of factor VIII and are considered separately belowunder von Willebrand’s disease. Normal haemostasisrequires 25% factor VIII activity. Though occasional patientswith 25% factor VIII level may develop bleeding, mostsymptomatic haemophilic patients have factor VIII levelsbelow 5%.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Patients of haemophilia suffer from\\nbleeding for hours or days after the injury. The clinical\\nseverity of the disease correlates well with plasma level offactor VIII activity. Haemophilic bleeding can involve anyorgan but occurs most commonly as recurrent painfulhaemarthroses and muscle haematomas, and sometimes ashaematuria. Spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage andoropharyngeal bleeding are rare, but when they occur theyare the most feared complications.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  The following tests are\\nabnormal:\\n1. Whole blood coagulation time is prolonged in severe\\ncases only.\\n2. Prothrombin time is usually normal.\\n3. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT or PTTK)\\nis typically prolonged.\\n4. Specific assay for factor VIII shows lowered activity.\\nThe diagnosis of female carriers  is made by the findings of\\nabout half the activity of factor VIII, while the manifest\\ndisease  is associated with factor VIII activity below 25%.336SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular TissuesTREATMENT.  Symptomatic patients with bleeding\\nepisodes are treated with factor VIII replacement therapy,\\nconsisting of factor VIII concentrates or plasma cryo-precipitates. With the availability of this treatment, the lifeexpectancy of even severe haemophilic patients was approa-ching normal but the occurrence of AIDS in multitransfusedhaemophilic patients has adversely affected the lifeexpectancy.\\nChristmas Disease (Haemophilia B)\\nInherited deficiency of factor IX (Christmas factor or plasma\\nthromboplastin component) produces Christmas disease orhaemophilia B. Haemophilia B is rarer than haemophilia A;its estimated incidence is 1 in 100,000 male births. Theinheritance pattern and clinical features of factor IX deficiencyare indistinguishable from those of classic haemophilia butaccurate laboratory diagnosis is critical since haemophilia Brequires treatment with different plasma fraction. The usualscreening tests for coagulation are similar to those in classichaemophilia but bioassay of factor IX reveals loweredactivity.\\nTREATMENT.  Therapy in symptomatic haemophilia B\\nconsists of infusion of either fresh frozen plasma or a plasma\\nenriched with factor IX. Besides the expected possibilities ofcomplications of hepatitis, chronic liver disease and AIDS,the replacement therapy in factor IX deficiency may activatethe coagulation system and cause thrombosis and embolism.\\nvon Willebrand’s Disease\\nDEFINITION AND PATHOGENESIS.  von Willebrand’s\\ndisease (vWD) is the most common hereditary coagulation\\ndisorder occurring due to qualitative or quantitative defectin von Willebrand’s factor (vWF). Its incidence is estimatedto be 1 in 1,000 individuals of either sex. The vWF comprisesthe larger fraction of factor VIII-vWF complex whichcirculates in the blood. Though the two components of factorVIII-vWF complex circulate together as a unit and performthe important function in clotting and facilitate plateletadhesion to subendothelial collagen, vWF differs from factorVIII in the following respects:\\n1.The gene for vWF is located at chromosome 12, while that\\nof factor VIII is in X-chromosome. Thus, vWD is inherited as\\nan autosomal dominant trait which may occur in either sex,while factor VIII deficiency (haemophilia A) is a sex (X-)-linked recessive disorder.\\n2.The vWF is synthesised  in the endothelial cells, mega-\\nkaryocytes and platelets but not in the liver cells, while the\\nprincipal site of synthesis of factor VIII is the liver.\\n3.\\nThe main function  of vWF is to facilitate the adhesion of\\nplatelets to subendothelial collagen, while factor VIII is\\ninvolved in activation of factor X in the intrinsic coagulationpathway.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinically, the patients of vWD are\\ncharacterised by spontaneous bleeding from mucous\\nmembranes and excessive bleeding from wounds. There are3 major types of vWD:Type I disease  is the most common and is characterised by\\nmild to moderate decrease in plasma vWF (50% activity).The synthesis of vWF is normal but the release of itsmultimers is inhibited.\\nType II disease  is much less common and is characterised\\nby normal or near normal levels of vWF which is functionally\\ndefective.\\nType III disease  is extremely rare and is the most severe\\nform of the disease. These patients have no detectable vWF\\nactivity and may have sufficiently low factor VIII levels.\\nBleeding episodes in vWD are treated with cryo-\\nprecipitates or factor VIII concentrates.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  These are as under:\\n1. Prolonged bleeding time.\\n2. Normal platelet count.3. Reduced plasma vWF concentration.4. Defective platelet aggregation with ristocetin, an\\nantibiotic.\\n5. Reduced factor VIII activity.\\nVitamin K Deficiency\\nVitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin which plays important\\nrole in haemostasis since it serves as a cofactor in theformation of 6 prothrombin complex proteins (vitamin K-\\ndependent coagulation factors)  synthesised in the liver: factor\\nII, VII, IX, X, protein C and protein S. Vitamin K is obtainedfrom green vegetables, absorbed in the small intestine andstored in the liver (Chapter 9). Some quantity of vitamin K isendogenously synthesised by the bacteria in the colon.\\nVitamin K deficiency may present in the newborn or in\\nsubsequent childhood or adult life:\\nNeonatal vitamin K deficiency.  Deficiency of vitamin K\\nin the newborn causes haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.Liver cell immaturity, lack of gut bacterial synthesis of thevitamin and low quantities in breast milk, all contribute tovitamin K deficiency in the newborn and may causehaemorrhage on 2nd to 4th day of life. Routine administrationof vitamin K to all newly born infants has led todisappearance of neonatal vitamin K deficiency.\\nVitamin K deficiency in children and adult. There are 3\\nmajor causes of vitamin K deficiency in childhood or adultlife:\\n1. Inadequate dietary intake.\\n2. Intestinal malabsorption.3. Loss of storage site due to hepatocellular disease.\\nWith the onset of vitamin K deficiency, the plasma levels\\nof all the 6 vitamin K-dependent factors (prothrombin\\ncomplex proteins) fall. This, in turn, results in prolonged PTand PTTK. Parenteral administration of vitamin K rapidlyrestores vitamin K levels in the liver.\\nCoagulation Disorders in Liver Disease\\nSince liver is the major site for synthesis and metabolism of\\ncoagulation factors, liver disease often leads to multiplehaemostatic abnormalities. The liver also produces inhibitors337CHAPTER 13 Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicineof coagulation such as antithrombin III and protein C and S\\nand plays a role in the clearance of activated factors andfibrinolytic enzymes. Thus, patients with liver disease maydevelop hypercoagulability and are predisposed to developDIC and systemic fibrinolysis.\\nThe major causes of bleeding in liver diseases are as\\nunder:\\nA. Morphologic lesions:\\n1. Portal hypertension e.g. varices, splenomegaly with\\nsecondary thrombocytopenia.\\n2.Peptic ulceration.\\n3. Gastritis.\\nB.\\nHepatic dysfunctions:\\n1. Impaired hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors.\\n2. Impaired hepatic synthesis of coagulation inhibitors:\\nprotein C, protein S and antithrombin III.3.Impaired absorption and metabolism of vitamin K.\\n4\\n. Failure to clear activated coagulation factors causing DIC\\nand systemic fibrinolysis.\\nC.  Complications of therapy:\\n1. Following massive transfusion leading to dilution of\\nplatelets and coagulation factors.\\n2.Infusion of activated coagulation proteins.\\n3. Following heparin therapy.\\nMany a times, the haemostatic abnormality in liver\\ndisease is complex but most patients have prolonged PT and\\nPTTK, mild thrombocytopenia, normal fibrinogen level anddecreased hepatic stores of vitamin K.\\nHAEMORRHAGIC DIA THESIS DUE T\\nO\\nFIBRINOL YTIC DEFECTS\\nNormally, fibrinolysis consisting of plasminogen-plasmin\\nand fibrin degradation products (FDPs) is an essentialprotective physiologic mechanism to limit the bloodcoagulation in the body. However, unchecked and excessivefibrinolysis may sometimes be the cause of bleeding. Thecauses of primary pathologic fibrinolysis leading to\\nhaemorrhagic defects are as under:\\n1.Deficiency of α\\n2-plasmin inhibitor following trauma or\\nsurgery.\\n2. Impaired clearance of tissue plasminogen activator such\\nas in cirrhosis of liver.At times, it may be difficult to distinguish primary\\npathologic fibrinolysis from secondary fibrinolysisaccompanying DIC.\\nDISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)\\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), also termed\\ndefibrination syndrome or consumption coagulopathy, is acomplex thrombo-haemorrhagic disorder (intravascularcoagulation and haemorrhage) occurring as a secondarycomplication in some systemic diseases.\\nETIOLOGY.  Although there are numerous conditions\\nassociated with DIC, most frequent causes are listed below:\\n1. Massive tissue injury:  in obstetrical syndromes (e.g.\\nabruptio placentae, amniotic fluid embolism, retained dead\\nfoetus), massive trauma, metastatic malignancies, surgery.\\n2.Infections:  especially endotoxaemia, gram-negative and\\nmeningococcal septicaemia, certain viral infections, malaria,\\naspergillosis.\\n3.\\nWidespread endothelial damage:  in aortic aneurysm,\\nhaemolytic-uraemic syndrome, severe burns, acute\\nglomerulonephritis.\\n4. Miscellaneous:  snake bite, shock, acute intravascular\\nhaemolysis, heat stroke.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Although in each case, a distinct trig-\\ngering mechanism has been identified, the sequence of\\nevents, in general, can be summarised as under (Fig. 13.7):\\n1. Activation of coagulation.  The etiologic factors listed\\nabove initiate widespread activation of coagulation pathwayby release of tissue factor.\\n2. Thrombotic phase.  Endothelial damage from the various\\nthrombogenic stimuli causes generalised platelet aggregation\\nand adhesion with resultant deposition of small thrombi andemboli throughout the microvasculature.\\n3.\\nConsumption phase.  The early thrombotic phase is\\nfollowed by a phase of consumption of coagulation factors\\nand platelets.\\n4. Secondary fibrinolysis.  As a protective mechanism,\\nfibrinolytic system is secondarily activated at the site of\\nintravascular coagulation. Secondary fibrinolysis causesbreakdown of fibrin resulting in formation of FDPs in thecirculation.\\nPathophysiology of DIC is summed up schematically in\\nFig. 13.8.\\nFigure 13.7 The pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\\n338SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  There are 2 main features of DIC—\\nbleeding  as the most common manifestation, and organ\\ndamage  due to ischaemia caused by the effect of widespread\\nintravascular thrombosis such as in the kidney and brain.\\nLess common manifestations include: microangiopathichaemolytic anaemia and thrombosis in larger arteries andveins.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  The laboratory investigations\\ninclude the following:\\n1. The platelet count is low.\\n2. Blood film shows the features of microangiopathic\\nhaemolytic anaemia. There is presence of schistocytes andfragmented red cells due to damage caused by trapping\\nand passage through the fibrin thrombi.\\n3. Prothrombin time, thrombin time and activated partial\\nthromboplastin time, are all prolonged.\\n4. Plasma fibrinogen levels are reduced due to consump-\\ntion in microvascular coagulation.\\n5.

The ABO andRhesus (Rh) blood group systems are of major clinicalsignificance. Other minor and clinically less important blood\\ngroup systems are: Lewis system, P system, I system, MNS\\nsystem, Kell and Duffy system, and Luthern system.\\nIndividuals who lack the corresponding antigen and have\\nnot been previously transfused have naturally-occurring\\nantibodies  in their serum. The most important are anti-A and\\nanti-B antibodies, usually of IgM class. Immune antibodies,\\non the other hand, are acquired in response to transfusionand by transplacental passage during pregnancy. These are\\nwarm antibodies, usually of IgG class.\\nABO SYSTEM.  This system consists of 3 major allelic genes:\\nA, B and O, located on the long arm of chromosome 9. These\\ngenes control the synthesis of blood group antigens A and\\nB. The serum of an individual contains naturally-occurring\\nantibodies to A and/or B antigen, whichever antigen islacking in the person’s red cells (Table 13.4).  Two subgroups\\nof A—A\\n1 and A2, and thus of AB also, A1B and A2B, are\\nrecognised but are of minor clinical significance. In routinepractice, the ABO type is determined by testing the red bloodcells with anti-A and anti-B and by testing the serum againstA, B and O red blood cells.\\nRed blood cells of type O and A\\n2 have large amounts of\\nanother antigen called H substance which is genetically\\ndifferent from ABO but is a precursor of A and B antigens.An O group individual who inherits A or B genes but fails to\\ninherit H gene from either parent is called O\\nh phenotype or\\nBombay blood group.  In such rare individual, despite the\\npresence of all the three antibodies in serum (anti-A, anti-B\\nand anti-H), the red cells are not agglutinated by the antisera.\\nRHESUS SYSTEM.  The Rhesus (Rh) blood group system\\nwas first discovered on human red cells by the use of antisera\\nprepared by immunising rabbits with red cells from a Rhesusmonkey. The Rh allelic genes are C or c, D or d and E or e,\\nlocated on chromosome 1. One set of 3 genes is inheritedfrom each parent giving rise to various complexcombinations. The corresponding antigens are similarlynamed Cc, Ee   and only D since no d antigen exists.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 13.4: The ABO Blood Groups.\\nBlood Antigens on Naturally-Occurring\\nGroup Red Cells Serum Antibodies\\nAB A\\nB None\\nA A Anti-B\\nB B Anti-A\\nO O Anti-A, Anti-BHowever, out of all these, D antigen is most strongly\\nimmunogenic and, therefore, clinically most important. Inpractice, Rh grouping is performed with anti-D antiserum.\\nIndividuals who are D-positive are referred to as Rh-positive\\nand those who lack D antigen are termed Rh-negative.\\nPractically, there are no naturally-occurring Rh anti-\\nbodies. All Rh antibodies in Rh-negative individuals are\\nacquired from immunisation such as by transfusion andduring pregnancy, resulting in fatal haemolytic transfusion\\nreaction and haemolytic disease of the newborn (described\\nlater).\\nBLOOD TRANSFUSION\\nA pre-transfusion compatibility testing is essential prior to\\nany blood transfusion. The procedure consists of thefollowing:\\n1.ABO and Rh(D) grouping of the patient (recipient).\\n2.Antibody screening  of the patient’s serum to detect the\\npresence of clinically significant antibodies.3.Selecting the donor  blood of the same ABO and Rh group.\\n4.Cross-matching  the patient’s serum against donor red cells\\nto confirm donor-recipient compatibility.\\nThe indications for blood transfusion are acute blood loss\\nand various haematologic disorders considered already. In\\naddition to the whole blood transfusion, the modern blood-\\nbanking techniques have made it possible to transfuse bloodcomponents such as packed red blood cells, platelets, whiteblood cell concentrates, plasma components and plasma-pheresis in specific situations.\\nComplications of Blood T\\nransfusion\\nA carefully prepared and supervised blood transfusion is\\nquite safe. However, in 5-6% of transfusions, untowardcomplications occur, some of which are minor while othersare more serious and at times fatal.\\nTransfusion reactions are generally classified into 2 types:\\nimmune and non-immune.\\nI.Immunologic transfusion reactions  may be against red blood\\ncells (haemolytic reactions), leucocytes, platelets or\\nimmunoglobulins.\\nII.Non-immune transfusion reactions  include circulatory\\noverload, massive transfusion, or transmission of an\\ninfectious agent.\\nThese transfusion reactions are considered below.\\nI. IMMUNOLOGIC TRANSFUSION REACTIONS.These are as under:\\n1.Haemolytic transfusion reactions.  Haemolytic trans-\\nfusion reaction may be immediate  or delayed, intravascular  or\\nextravascular.\\nVery rapid cell destruction associated with intravascular\\nhaemolysis  is usually due to ABO incompatibility since both\\nnaturally-occurring antibodies, anti-A and anti-B, are capable\\nof fixing complement. The symptoms include restlessness,anxiety, flushing, chest or lumbar pain, tachypnoea,\\ntachycardia and nausea, followed by shock and renal failure.340SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular TissuesExtravascular haemolysis  is more often due to immune\\nantibodies of the Rh system. The clinical manifestations are\\nrelatively less severe and usually consist of malaise and feverbut shock and renal failure may rarely occur. Some patientsdevelop delayed reactions in which the patient developsanaemia due to destruction of red cells in the RE system abouta week after transfusion. Such delayed reactions are generallythe result of previous transfusion or pregnancy (anamnesticreaction).\\n2. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). This is\\nan uncommon reaction resulting from transfusion of donor\\nplasma containing high levels of anti-HLA antibodies whichbind to leucocytes of recipient. These leucocytes thenaggregate in pulmonary micromutation and releasemediators of increased vascular permeability resulting inacute pulmonary oedema and signs and symptoms ofrespiratory failure.\\n3. Other allergic reactions.  Besides haemolytic transfusion\\nreaction, others reactions are as follows:\\ni) Febrile reaction  which is usually attributed to immunologic\\nreaction against white blood cells, platelets, or IgA class\\nimmunoglobulins.\\nii) Patients with antibodies against IgA molecule sometimes\\ndevelop anaphylactic shock  on transfusion of blood from other\\nhuman subjects.\\niii) Allergic reactions such as urticaria may occur.\\niv) Transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease  mediated by\\ndonor T lymphocytes may occur.\\nII. NONIMMUNE TRANSFUSION REACTIONS.  This\\ncategory includes the following adverse effects:\\n1.Circulatory overload.  Circulatory overload resulting in\\npulmonary congestion and acute heart failure is the most\\nimportant and most common complication that may resultin death following transfusion. The risk of circulatoryoverload is particularly high in patients with chronicanaemia, and in infants and the elderly. The onset may beimmediate, or may be delayed up to 24 hours.\\n2.Massive transfusion.  When the volume of stored blood\\ntransfused to bleeding patients exceeds their normal blood\\nvolume, it results in dilutional thrombocytopenia anddilution of coagulation factors.\\n3\\n. Transmission of infection.  Many diseases can be\\ntransmitted by transfusion of an infected blood. These\\ninclude: hepatitis (HBV, HCV), CMV infection, syphilis,malaria, toxoplasmosis, infectious mononucleosis, brucellosisand AIDS (HIV infection). The incidence increases in patientswho receive multiple transfusions such as cases ofhaemophilia, thalassaemia major, acute leukaemias, acutesevere haemorrhage etc. It has, therefore, been mandatorythat prior to any human transfusion, every unit of blood mustbe screened for the serologic testing of HIV, HBV, HCV andsyphilis and for the presence of malarial parasite.\\n4. Air embolism.  Air embolism is unlikely to occur if the\\nblood transfusion is carried out with plastic bags with\\nnegative pressure as is the usual practice nowadays. Adebilitated person may develop symptomatic air embolismeven if a small volume (10-40 ml) makes its way into thecirculation, whereas a healthy individual is at lesser risk.\\n5. Thrombophlebitis.  The complication of thrombophlebitis\\nis more commonly associated with venesection for blood\\ntransfusion, especially if it is done in the saphenous vein ofthe ankle rather than the veins of the arm. The risk ofdeveloping thrombophlebitis is further enhanced if thetransfusion is continued longer than 12 hours at a single site.\\n6. Transfusion haemosiderosis.  Post-transfusion iron\\noverload with deposition of iron in the tissues of the body\\noccurs after repeated transfusions in the absence of any bloodloss e.g. in thalassaemia major and in severe chronicrefractory anaemias. The body has no other means of gettingrid of extra iron except iron excretion at the rate of 1 mg perday. A unit of whole blood (400 ml) contains about 250 mgof iron. After approximately 100 units, the liver, myocardiumand endocrine glands are all damaged.\\nBLOOD COMPONENTS\\nBlood from donors is collected as whole blood in a suitable\\nanticoagulant. Nowadays it is a common practice to dividewhole blood into components which include: packed RBCs,platelets, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate.\\nThe procedure consists of initial centrifugation at low\\nspeed to separate whole blood into two parts: packed RBCs\\nand platelet-rich plasma (PRP) . Subsequently, PRP is\\ncentrifuged at high speed to yield two parts: random donor\\nplatelets  and FFP. Cryoprecipitates  are obtained by thawing of\\nFFP followed by centrifugation. Apheresis  is the technique of\\ndirect collection of large excess of platelets from a singledonor.\\nApplications of these blood components in clinical use\\nare as under:\\n1. Packed RBCs. These are used to raise the oxygen-carrying\\ncapacity of blood and are used in normovolaemic patients\\nof anaemia without cardiac disease. One unit of packed RBCsmay raise haemoglobin by 1 g/dl.\\n2. Platelets. Transfusion of platelets is done in patients of\\nthrombocytopenia who have haemorrhage. Optimally,\\nplatelet transfusions can be given to a patient with plateletcount below 10,000/ μl. Each unit of platelets can raise platelet\\ncount by 5,000 to 10,000/ μl.\\n3. Fresh frozen plasma . FFP contains plasma proteins and\\ncoagulation factors that include albumin, protein C and Sand antithrombin. FFP transfusion in indicated in patientsof coagulation failure and TTP. Each unit of FFP raisescoagulation factors by about 2%.\\n4. Cryoprecipitate. Cryoprecipitate is a source of insoluble\\nplasma proteins, fibrinogen, factor VIII and vWF. Indications\\nfor transfusion of cryoprecipitate are for patients requiringfibrinogen, factor VIII and vWF. Transfusion of single unitof cryoprecipitate yields about 80 IU of factor VIII.\\nHAEMOLYTIC DISEASE OF NEWBORN\\nHaemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) results from the\\npassage of IgG antibodies from the maternal circulation341CHAPTER 13 Disorders of Platelets, Bleeding Disorders and Basic Transfusion Medicineacross the placenta into the circulation of the foetal red cells.\\nBesides pregnancy, sensitisation of the mother may resultfrom previous abortions and previous blood transfusion.\\nHDN can occur from incompatibility of ABO or Rh blood\\ngroup system. ABO incompatibility is much more commonbut the HDN in such cases is usually mild, while Rh-Dincompatibility results in more severe form of the HDN.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The pathogenesis of the two main forms\\nof HDN is different.\\nHDN due to Rh-D incompatibility. Rh incompatibility\\noccurs when a Rh-negative mother is sensitised to Rh-positive blood. This results most often from a Rh-positivefoetus by passage of Rh-positive red cells across the placentainto the circulation of Rh-negative mother. Normally, duringpregnancy very few foetal red cells cross the placenta buthaemorrhage during parturition causes significantsensitisation of the mother. Sensitisation is more likely if themother and foetus are ABO compatible rather than ABOincompatible. Though approximately 95% cases of Rh-HDNare due to anti-D, some cases are due to combination of anti-D with other immune antibodies of the Rh system such asanti-C and anti-E, and rarely anti-c alone.\\nIt must be emphasised here that the risk of sensitisation\\nof a Rh-negative woman married to Rh-positive man is smallin first pregnancy but increases during successivepregnancies if prophylactic anti-D immunoglobulin is notgiven within 72 hours after the first delivery. If both theparents are Rh-D positive (homozygous), all the newbornswill be Rh-D positive, while if the father is Rh-D positive(heterozygous), there is a 50% chance of producing a Rh-Dnegative child.\\nHDN due to ABO incompatibility.  About 20% pregnancies\\nwith ABO incompatibility between the mother and the foetus\\ndevelop the HDN. Naturally-occurring anti-A and anti-Bantibodies’ which are usually of IgM class do not cross theplacenta, while immune anti-A and anti-B antibodies whichare usually of IgG class may cross the placenta into foetalcirculation and damage the foetal red cells. ABO HDN occursmost frequently in infants born to group O mothers whopossess anti-A and/or anti-B IgG antibodies. ABO-HDNdiffers from Rh(D)-HDN, in that it occurs in first pregnancy,Coombs’ (antiglobulin) test is generally negative, and is lesssevere than the latter.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The HDN due to Rh-D incompa-\\ntibility in its severest form  may result in intrauterine death\\nfrom hydrops foetalis. Moderate disease  produces a baby born\\nwith severe anaemia and jaundice due to unconjugated\\nhyperbilirubinaemia. When the level of unconjugatedbilirubin exceeds 20 mg/dl, it may result in deposition ofbile pigment in the basal ganglia of the CNS called kernicterusand result in permanent brain damage. Mild disease,  however,\\ncauses only severe anaemia with or without jaundice.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  The haematologic findings\\nin cord blood and mother’s blood are as under:\\n1. Cord blood  shows variable degree of anaemia, reticulo-\\ncytosis, elevated serum bilirubin and a positive direct\\nCoombs’ test if the cord blood is Rh-D positive.\\n2. Mother’s blood is Rh-D negative with high plasma titre\\nof anti-D.\\nCOURSE AND PROGNOSIS.  The course in HDN may\\nrange from death, to minimal haemolysis, to mentalretardation. The practice of administration of anti-Rhimmunoglobulin to the mother before or after delivery hasreduced the incidence of HDN as well as protects the motherbefore the baby’s RBCs sensitise the mother’s blood.Exchange transfusion of the baby is done to remove theantibodies, remove red cells susceptible to haemolysis andalso to lower the bilirubin level.\\n❑342SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nDisorders of Leucocytes and\\nLymphoreticular TissuesChapter 14Chapter 14\\nAs illustrated in Fig. 12.3, pluripotent stem cells in the bone\\nmarrow divide to form two types of stem cells: myeloidtrilineage stem cells and lymphoid stem cells. Myeloidtrilineage stem cells further divide to form three types of celllines: erythroid progenitor cells (discussed in Chapter 12),megakaryocytic progenitor cells (discussed in Chapter 13),and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells. In this chapter,we will discuss the abnormalities pertaining to the remainingtwo cell lines—granulocyte-monocyte cell line and thelymphoid cell lines, besides discussion on all haematopoieticneoplasms. Both these cell lines constitute leucocyte pool inthe body at two distinct locations: in circulating blood andin the tissues. This concept holds more true for lymphoidcells in particular, which are present in circulation as well asare distributed in the lymphoid tissues of the body (lymphnodes, spleen, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue—MALT,pharyngeal lymphoid tissue). B, T and NK lymphoid cellsare formed after differentiation from lymphopoieticprecursor cells in the bone marrow undergo furthermaturation in peripheral lymphoid organs and thymus(Chapter 4). Thus, relationship of haematopoietic tissues andlymphoreticluar tissues is quite close. In fact, currentlymphoma-leukaemia classification system does not considerdiseases of lymphocytes in the blood and in the lymphoidtissues as separate disorders but are seen to representdifferent stages of the same biologic process. Hence, incontemporary learning of these diseases, it is desirable tostudy diseases of leucocytes together with diseases oflymphoreticular tissues of the body.\\nLYMPH NODES: NORMAL AND REACTIVE\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe lymph nodes are bean-shaped or oval structures varying\\nin length from 1 to 2 cm and form the part of lymphaticnetwork distributed throughout the body. Each lymph nodeis covered by a connective tissue capsule.  At the convex\\nsurface of the capsule several afferent lymphatics  enter which\\ndrain into the peripheral subcapsular sinus,  branch into the\\nlymph node and terminate at the concavity (hilum) as a singleefferent lymphatic  vessel. These lymphatic vessels are lined\\nby mononuclear phagocytic cells.\\nThe inner structure of the lymph node is divided into a\\nperipheral cortex and central medulla. The cortex  consists of\\nseveral rounded aggregates of lymphocytes called lymphoid\\nfollicles.  The follicle has a pale-staining germinal centre\\nsurrounded by small dark-staining lymphocytes called themantle zone. The deeper region of the cortex or paracortex  isthe zone between the peripheral cortex and the inner medulla.The medulla  is predominantly composed of cords of plasma\\ncells and some lymphocytes. The capsule and the structurewithin the lymph node are connected by supportive delicatereticulin framework (Fig. 14.1,A).\\nFunctionally, the lymph node is divided into T and B\\nlymphocyte zones:\\nB-cell zone  lies in the follicles in the cortex, the mantle\\nzone and the interfollicular space, while plasma cells  are also\\npresent in the interfollicular zone.\\nT-cell zone  is predominantly present in the medulla.\\n There are two main functions of the lymph node—to\\nmount immune response in the body, and to perform thefunction of active phagocytosis for particulate material.Besides T and B-cells, the follicular centre has dendritic\\nhistiocytes and antigen-presenting  Langerhans’ histiocytes\\n(formerly together called tingible body macrophages due toengulfment of particulate material by them) and endothelial\\ncells . The follicular centre is a very active zone where\\nlymphocytes from peripheral blood continuously enter andleave, interact with macrophage-histiocytes and endothelialcells and undergo maturation  and transformation.Lymphocytes and endothelial cells have surface moleculeswhich interact and serve as ‘addresses’ so that endothelialcells can direct the lymphocytes; these molecules areappropriately termed as addressins  or homing receptors .\\nPeripheral blood B and T lymphocytes on entering the lymphnode are stimulated immunologically which transforms themto undergo cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation which maybe in the follicular centre or paracortex as per followingsequence and schematically depicted in Fig. 14.1,B:\\ni) Follicular centre, small non-cleaved cells or centroblastsii) Follicular centre, small cleaved cells or centrocytesiii) Follicular centre, large cleaved cellsiv) Follicular centre, large non-cleaved cellsv) Immunoblasts (in paracortex)vi) Convoluted cells or lymphoblasts (in paracortex)vii) Plasma cells.\\nLymph nodes are secondarily involved in a variety of\\nsystemic diseases, local injuries and infections, and are alsothe site for some important primary neoplasms. Many ofthese diseases such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis,histoplasmosis, typhoid fever, viral infections etc. have beenconsidered elsewhere in the textbook along with descriptionof these primary diseases. Reactive lymphadenitis isdiscussed below while the subject of lymphoid neoplasmsincluding plasma cell disorders and Langerhans’ cellhistiocytosis is discussed under haematologic neoplasms.343CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular TissuesREACTIVE LYMPHADENITIS\\nLymph nodes undergo reactive changes in response to a wide\\nvariety of stimuli which include microbial infections, drugs,environmental pollutants, tissue injury, immune-complexesand malignant neoplasms. However, the most commoncauses of lymph node enlargement are inflammatory andimmune reactions, aside from primary malignant neoplasmsand metastatic tumour deposits. Those due to primaryinflammatory reaction are termed reactive lymphadenitis,  and\\nthose due to primary immune reactions are referred to aslymphadenopathy.\\nReactive lymphadenitis is a nonspecific response and is\\ncategorised into acute and chronic types, each with a fewvariant forms.\\nAcute Nonspecific Lymphadenitis\\nAll kinds of acute inflammations may cause acute nonspecific\\nlymphadenitis in the nodes draining the area of inflamedtissue. Most common causes are microbiologic infections ortheir breakdown products, and foreign bodies in the woundor into the circulation etc. Most frequently involved lymphnodes are: cervical (due to infections in the oral cavity), axillary\\n(due to infection in the arm), inguinal  (due to infection in the\\nlower extremities), and mesenteric  (due to acute appendicitis,\\nacute enteritis etc).\\nAcute lymphadenitis is usually mild and transient but\\noccasionally it may be more severe. Acutely inflamed nodesare enlarged, tender, and if extensively involved, may befluctuant. The overlying skin is red and hot. After control ofinfection, majority of cases heal completely without leavingany scar. If the inflammation does not subside, acutelymphadenitis changes into chronic lymphadenitis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the affected\\nlymph nodes are enlarged 2-3 times their normal size andmay show abscess formation if the involvement isextensive.Microscopically,  the sinusoids are congested, widely\\ndilated and oedematous and contain numerous neutro-phils. The lymphoid follicles are prominent with presenceof many mitoses and phagocytosis. In more severe cases,necrosis may occur and neutrophil abscesses may form.\\nChronic Nonspecific Lymphadenitis\\nChronic nonspecific lymphadenitis, commonly called reactive\\nlymphoid hyperplasia, is a common form of inflammatory\\nreaction of draining lymph nodes as a response to antigenic\\nstimuli such as repeated attacks of acute lymphadenitis andlymph from malignant tumours.\\nDepending upon the pattern in chronic nonspecific\\nlymphadenitis, three types are distinguished, each havingits own set of causes. These are:  follicular hyperplasia,\\nparacortical hyperplasia  and sinus histiocytosis.  However, mixed\\npatterns may also be seen in which case one of the patternspredominates over the others.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the affected\\nlymph nodes are usually enlarged, firm and non-tender.Microscopically,  the features of 3 patterns of reactive\\nlymphoid hyperplasia are as under:\\n1.Follicular hyperplasia is the most frequent pattern,\\nparticularly encountered in children. Besides nonspecific\\nstimulation, a few specific causes are: rheumatoid arthritis,toxoplasmosis, syphilis and AIDS. The microscopicfeatures are as follows (Fig. 14.2):\\ni) There is marked enlargement and prominence of thegerminal centres of lymphoid follicles (proliferation of B-cell areas) due to the presence of numerous mitoticallyactive lymphocytes and proliferation of phagocytic cellscontaining phagocytosed material.ii)Parafollicular and medullary regions are more cellular\\nand contain plasma cells, histiocytes, and someneutrophils and eosinophils.iii) There is hyperplasia of mononuclear phagocytic cellslining the lymphatic sinuses in the lymph node.\\nAngiofollicular lymphoid hyperplasia  or Castleman’s\\ndisease  is a clinicopathologic variant of follicularFigure 14.1 Normal lymph node. A, The anatomic structure and functional zones of a lymph node. B, Maturation of lymphoid cells in the follicle.\\n344SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nhyperplasia. The condition may occur at any age and\\npossibly has an association with Epstein-Barr virusinfection. Two histologic forms are distinguished:\\ni)Hyaline-vascular type is more common (90% cases) and\\nis characterised by the presence of hyalinised arterioles\\nin small lymphoid follicles and proliferation of vessels inthe interfollicular area.\\nii)Plasma cell form  is less common and is characterised\\nby plasma cell hyperplasia and vascular proliferation in\\nthe interfollicular region.\\n2. Paracortical lymphoid hyperplasia is due to hyper-\\nplasia of T-cell-dependent area of the lymph node.\\nAmongst the important causes are immunologic reactionscaused by drugs (e.g. dilantin), vaccination, viruses (e.g.infectious mononucleosis) and autoimmune disorders. Itshistologic features are:i) Expansion of the paracortex (T-cell area) with increa-sed number of T-cell transformed immunoblasts.ii) Encroachment by the enlarged paracortex on thelymphoid follicles, sometimes resulting in their efface-ment.iii) Hyperplasia of the mononuclear phagocytic cells inthe lymphatic sinuses.\\nVariants of paracortical lymphoid hyperplasia are\\nangio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy, dermatopathiclymphadenopathy, dilantin lymphadenopathy and post-vaccinial lymphadenopathy.\\nAngioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy is characterised\\nby diffuse hyperplasia of immunoblasts rather thanparacortical hyperplasia only, and there is proliferationof blood vessels. The condition occurs in elderly patientswith generalised lymph node enlargement andhypergammaglobulinaemia.\\nDermatopathic lymphadenopathy  occurs in lymph node\\ndraining an area of skin lesion. Besides the hyperplasticparacortex, there is presence of dark melanin pigmentwithin the macrophages in the lymph node.3. Sinus histiocytosis or sinus hyperplasia  is a very\\ncommon type found in regional lymph nodes draininginflammatory lesions, or as an immune reaction of the hostto a draining malignant tumour or its products. Thehallmark of histologic diagnosis is the expansion of thesinuses by proliferating large histiocytes containingphagocytosed material (Fig. 14.3).  The presence of sinus\\nhistiocytosis in the draining lymph nodes of carcinomasuch as in breast carcinoma has been considered by someworkers to confer better prognosis in such patients due togood host immune response.\\nSinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy  is\\ncharacterised by marked enlargement of lymph nodes,especially of the neck, in young adolescents. It is associatedwith characteristic clinical features of painless but massivelymphadenopathy with fever and leucocytosis andusually runs a benign and self-limiting course.\\nHIV-related Lymphadenopathy\\nHIV infection and AIDS have already been discussed in\\nChapter 4; here one of the frequent finding in early cases ofAIDS,  persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (PGL),  is\\ndescribed. The presence of enlarged lymph nodes of morethan 1 cm diameter at two or more extra-inguinal sites formore than 3 months without any other obvious cause isfrequently the earliest symptom of primary HIV infection.\\nHistologically,  the findings at biopsy of involved lymph\\nnode vary depending upon the stage of HIV infection:1.In the early stage  marked follicular hyperplasia is the\\ndominant finding and reflects the polyclonalB-cell proliferation.2In the intermediate stage,  there is a combination of\\nfollicular hyperplasia and follicular involution. However,adenopathic form of Kaposi’s sarcoma too may developat this stage (page 414).3.In the last stage,  there is decrease in the lymph node\\nsize indicative of prognostic marker of diseaseFigure 14.2 Reactive lymphadenitis, follicular hyperplasia type. Figure 14.3 Reactive lymphadenitis, sinus histiocytosis  type.\\n345CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuesprogression. Microscopic findings of node at this stage\\nreveal follicular involution and lymphocyte depletion. Atthis stage, other stigmata of AIDS in the lymph node mayalso appear e.g. lymphoma, mycobacterial infection,toxoplasmosis, systemic fungal infections etc.\\nWHITE BLOOD CELLS:\\nNORMAL AND REACTIVE\\nThe leucocytes of the peripheral blood are of 2 main varieties,distinguished by the presence or absence of granules:granulocytes  and nongranular leucocytes.  The granulocytes,\\naccording to the appearance of nuclei, are subdivided intopolymorphonuclear leucocytes and monocytes. Further,depending upon the colour of granules, polymorphonuclearleucocytes are of 3 types: neutrophils, eosinophils andbasophils. The nongranular leucocytes are 3 types oflymphocytes: T, B and natural killer (NK) cells.\\nGRANULOPOIESIS\\nSite of Formation and Kinetics\\nAll forms of granulocytes are produced in the bone marrow\\nand are termed, ‘myeloid series’. Myeloid series include\\nmaturing stages: myeloblast (most primitive precursor),promyelocyte, myelocyte, metamyelocyte, band forms andsegmented granulocyte (mature form). The myeloblast,promyelocyte and myelocyte form a ‘proliferative or mitotic\\npool’,  while the remainder (i.e. metamyelocyte, band forms\\nand segmented granulocytes) make up a ‘mature or post-\\nmitotic pool’.  It takes about 12 days for formation of mature\\ngranulocytes from the myeloblast. Normally the bonemarrow contains more myeloid cells than the erythroid cellsin the ratio of 2:1 to 15:1 (average 3:1), the largest proportionbeing that of metamyelocytes, band forms and segmentedneutrophils.\\nNormally, the bone marrow storage compartment\\ncontains about 10-15 times the number of granulocytes foundin the peripheral blood. Following their release from the bonemarrow, granulocytes spend about 10 hours in the circulationbefore they move into the tissues, where they perform theirrespective functions. The blood pool of granulocytes consistsof 2 components of about equal size—the circulating pool  that\\nis included in the blood count, and the marginating pool  that\\nis not included in the blood count. Granulocytes spend about4-5 days in the tissues before they are either destroyed duringphagocytosis or die due to senescence. To control the variouscompartments of granulocytes, a ‘feed-back system’ existsbetween the circulating and tissue granulocytes on one side,and the marrow granulocytes on the other. The presence ofa humoral regulatory substance, ‘granulopoietin’ analogousto erythropoietin has also been identified by in vitro  studies\\nof colony-forming units (CFU) and is characterised as G-CSF(granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and GM-CSF(granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor).\\nThe kinetics of monocytes is less well understood than\\nthat of other myeloid cells. Monocytes spend about 20-40hours in the circulation after which they leave the blood toenter extravascular tissues where they perform their mainfunction of active phagocytosis. The extravascular lifespanof tissue macrophages which are the transformed form ofblood monocytes, may vary from a few months to a few years.\\nMyeloid Series\\nThe development of myeloid cells from myeloblast takes\\nplace in the following sequence (Fig. 14.4):\\n1.MYELOBLAST.  The myeloblast is the earliest\\nrecognisable precursor of the granulocytes, normallycomprising about 2% of the total marrow cells. The myelo-blast varies considerably in size (10-18 μm in diameter),\\nhaving a large round to oval nucleus nearly filling the cell,has fine nuclear chromatin and contains 2-5 well-defined palenucleoli. The thin rim of cytoplasm is deeply basophilic anddevoid of granules. The myeloblasts of acute myeloidleukaemia may, however, show the presence of rod-likecytoplasmic inclusions called Auer’s rods  which represent\\nabnormal derivatives of primary azurophilic granules.\\nThe nuclei of successive stages during their development\\nfrom myeloblast become progressively coarser and lose theirnucleoli and the cytoplasm loses its blue colour. As the cellsbecome mature lysosomal granules appear; firstly non-specific primary or azurophilic granules appear which arefollowed by specific or secondary granules that differentiatethe neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils.\\n2.\\nPROMYELOCYTE.  The promyelocyte is slightly larger\\nthan the myeloblast (12-18 μm diameter). It possesses a round\\nto oval nucleus, having fine nuclear chromatin which is\\nslightly condensed around the nuclear membrane. Thenucleoli are present but are less prominent and fewer thanthose in the myeloblast. The main distinction of promyelocytefrom myeloblast is in the cytoplasm which containsazurophilic (primary or non-specific) granules.\\n3. MYELOCYTE.  The myelocyte is the stage in which\\nspecific or secondary granules appear in the cytoplasm, and\\naccordingly, the cell can be identified at this stage asbelonging to the neutrophilic, eosinophilic or basophilicmyelocyte. Primary granules also persist at this stage butformation of new primary granules stops. The nucleus ofmyelocyte is eccentric, round to oval, having somewhatcoarse nuclear chromatin and no visible nucleoli. Themyeloid cells up to the myelocyte stage continue to divideand, therefore, comprise mitotic or proliferative pool.\\n4. METAMYELOCYTE.  The metamyelocyte stage is 10-18\\nμm in diameter and is characterised by a clearly indented or\\nhorseshoe-shaped nucleus without nucleoli. The nuclearchromatin is dense and clumped. The cytoplasm containsboth primary and secondary granules. The metamyelocytesare best distinguished from the monocytes by the clumpednuclear chromatin while the latter have fine chromatin.\\n5. BAND FORMS.  Band form is juvenile granulocyte, 10-\\n16 μm in diameter, characterised by further condensation of\\nnuclear chromatin and transformation of nuclear shape into\\nband configuration of uniform thickness.346SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\n6. SEGMENTED GRANULOCYTES.  The mature poly-\\nmorphonuclear leucocytes, namely: the neutrophils, eosino-\\nphils and basophils, are described separately below.\\nCommon surface markers for all stages of myeloid series\\nof cells are CD33, CD13 and CD15. However, stages frommyelocytes to mature neutrophils also carry CD11b andCD14. Band forms and mature neutrophils have further CD10 and CD16.\\nMonocyte-Macrophage Series\\nThe monocyte-macrophage series of cells, though comprise\\na part of myeloid series alongwith other granulocytic series,but are described separately here in view of differentmorphologic stages in their maturation (Fig. 14.4).\\n1.MONOBLAST.  The monoblast is the least mature of the\\nrecognisable cell of monocyte-macrophage series. It is verysimilar in appearance to myeloblasts except that it hasground-glass cytoplasm with irregular border and may showphagocytosis as indicated by the presence of engulfed redcells in the cytoplasm. However, differentiation frommyeloblast at times may be difficult even by electronmicroscopy and, therefore, it is preferable to call the earliestprecursor of granulocytic series as myelomonoblast.\\n2. PROMONOCYTE.  The promonocyte is a young mono-\\ncyte, about 20 μm in diameter and possesses a large indented\\nnucleus containing a nucleolus. The cytoplasm is basophilicand contains no azurophilic granules but may have finegranules which are larger than those in the mature monocyte.\\n3.MONOCYTE.  The mature form of monocytic series is\\ndescribed below, while the transformed stages of these cells\\nin various tissues (i.e. macrophages) are a part of RE systemdiscussed in Chapter 4.\\nMonocyte-macrophage series having specialised function\\nof phagocytosis secrete active products such as lysozyme,neutral proteases, acid hydrolases, components ofcomplement, tranferrin, fibronectin, nucleosides  and severalcytokines (TNF- α, IL-1, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18). They express\\nlineage-specific molecules CD 14, cell surface LPS receptorsetc.\\nL\\nYMPHOPOIESIS\\nSites of Formation and Kinetics\\nThe lymphocytes and the plasma cells are immunocompetent\\ncells of the body. In man, the bone marrow and the thymusare the primary lymphopoietic organs  where lymphoid stem\\ncells undergo spontaneous division independent of antigenicstimulation. The secondary or reactive lymphoid tissue  is\\ncomprised by the lymph nodes, spleen and gut-associatedlymphoid tissue (GALT). These sites actively producelymphocytes from the germinal centres of lymphoid folliclesas a response to antigenic stimulation. Lymphocytes passFigure 14.4 Granulopoiesis and the cellular compartments of myeloid cells in the bone marrow, blood and tissues.\\n347CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuesthrough a series of developmental changes in the course of\\ntheir evolution into lymphocyte subpopulations and subsets.It includes migration of immature lymphocytes to otherorgans such as the thymus where locally-produced factorsact on them.\\nFunctionally, the lymphocytes are divided into T, B and\\nnatural killer (NK) cells depending upon whether they areimmunologically active in cell-mediated immunity (T cells),in humoral antibody response (B cells) or form part of thenatural or innate immunity and act as killer of some viruses(NK cells). In man, the B cells are derived from the bonemarrow stem cells, while in birds they mature in the bursaof Fabricius. After antigenic activation, B cells proliferate andmature into plasma cells which secrete specific immuno-globulin antibodies. The T cells are also produced in the bonemarrow and possibly in the thymus. NK cells do not have Bor T cell markers, nor are these cells dependent upon thymusfor development. The concept of T, B and NK cells alongwith lymphocyte subpopulations and their functions isdiscussed in Chapter 4.\\nLymphoid Series\\nThe maturation stages in production of lymphocytes are\\nillustrated in Fig. 14.5 and are as under:\\n1. LYMPHOBLAST.  The lymphoblast is the earliest identi-\\nfiable precursor of lymphoid cells and is a rapidly dividingcell. It is a large cell, 10-18 μm in diameter, containing a large\\nround to oval nucleus having slightly clumped or stipplednuclear chromatin. The nuclear membrane is denser and thenumber of nucleoli is fewer (1-2) as compared with those inmyeloblast (2-5). The cytoplasm is scanty, basophilic and non-granular.\\nThe distinguishing morphologic features between the\\nmyeloblast and lymphoblast are summarised in Table 14.1.2.PROLYMPHOCYTE.  This stage is an intermediate stage\\nbetween the lymphoblast and mature lymphocyte. Theseyoung lymphocytes are 9-18 μm in diameter, contain round\\nto indented nucleus with slightly stippled or coarsechromatin and may have 0-1 nucleoli.\\n3. LYMPHOCYTE.  The mature lymphocytes are described\\nbelow.\\nMATURE LEUCOCYTES IN HEAL\\nTH AND\\nREACTION IN DISEASE\\nNormally, only mature leucocytes namely: polymorphs,\\nlymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils, arefound in the peripheral blood. The normal range of total anddifferential leucocyte count (TLC and DLC expressedsequentially as P, L, M, E, B) in health in adults and childrenis given in  Table 14.2.  White cell count tends to be higher in\\ninfants and children than in adults. It also normallyundergoes minor degree of diurnal variation with a slightrise in the afternoon. The total white cell count is normallyhigh in pregnancy and following delivery, usually returningto normal within a week. The pathological variations in whitecell values together with brief review of their morphologyand functions are considered below (Fig. 14.6):\\nPolymorphs (Neutrophils)\\nMORPHOLOGY.  A polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN),\\ncommonly called polymorph or neutrophil, is 12-15 μm in\\ndiameter. It consists of a characteristic dense nucleus, having\\n2-5 lobes and pale cytoplasm containing numerous fineviolet-pink granules. These lysosomal granules containseveral enzymes and are of 2 types:\\nPrimary or azurophilic granules  are large and coarse and\\nappear early at the promyelocyte stage.

These appear later at myelocyte stage, are MPO-\\nnegative and contain lactoferrin, NADPH oxidase,histaminase, vitamin B\\n12 binding protein, and receptors for\\nchemoattractants and for laminin.\\nThe normal  functions  of neutrophils are as under:\\n1.Chemotaxis  or cell mobilisation in which the cell is\\nattracted towards bacteria or at the site of inflammation.\\n2.Phagocytosis  in which the foreign particulate material of\\ntiny sizes is phagocytosed by actively motile neutrophils;\\nthus PMNs act as microphages compared to function ofmonocytes as macrophages.\\n3.Killing  of the microorganism is mediated by oxygen-\\ndependent and oxygen-independent pathways (Chapter 3).\\nPATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS.  Pathologic variations in\\nneutrophils include variations in count, morphology and\\ndefective function.\\nVariation in count.  An increase in neutrophil count (neutro-\\nphil leucocytosis or neutrophilia)  or a decrease in count\\n(neutropenia)  may occur in various diseases.\\nNeutrophil leucocytosis.  An increase in circulating\\nneutrophils above 7,500/ μl is the commonest type of\\nleucocytosis and occurs most commonly as a response to\\nacute bacterial infections. Some common causes ofneutrophilia are as under:\\n1.Acute infections, local or generalised,  especially by cocci but\\nalso by certain bacilli, fungi, spirochaetes, parasites and some\\nviruses. For example: pneumonia, cholecystitis, salpingitis,meningitis, diphtheria, plague, peritonitis, appendicitis,actinomycosis, poliomyelitis, abscesses, furuncles,carbuncles, tonsillitis, otitis media, osteomyelitis etc.\\n2.Other inflammations  e.g. tissue damage resulting from\\nburns, operations, ischaemic necrosis (such as in MI), gout,\\ncollagen-vascular diseases, hypersensitivity reactions etc.\\n3.Intoxication  e.g. uraemia, diabetic ketosis, eclampsia,\\npoisonings by chemicals and drugs.4.Acute haemorrhage,  internal or external.\\n5.Acute haemolysis.\\n6.Disseminated malignancies.\\n7.Myeloproliferative disorders  e.g. myeloid leukaemia,\\npolycythaemia vera, myeloid metaplasia.8.Miscellaneous  e.g. following corticosteroid therapy, idio-\\npathic neutrophilia.\\nNeutropenia.  When the absolute neutrophil count falls below\\n2,500/ μl, the patient is said to have neutropenia and is prone\\nto develop recurrent infections. Some common causes of\\nneutropenia (and hence leucopenia) are as follows:\\n1.Certain infections  e.g. typhoid, paratyphoid, brucellosis,\\ninfluenza, measles, viral hepatitis, malaria, kala-azar etc.\\n2.Overwhelming bacterial infections  especially in patients with\\npoor resistance e.g. miliary tuberculosis, septicaemia.3.Drugs, chemicals and physical agents  which induce aplasia\\nof the bone marrow cause neutropenia, e.g. antimetabolites,\\nnitrogen mustards, benzene, ionising radiation. Occasionally,certain drugs produce neutropenia due to individualsensitivity such as: anti-inflammatory (amidopyrine, phenyl-butazone), antibacterial (chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole),anticonvulsants, antithyroids, hypoglycaemics andantihistaminics.\\n4.Certain haematological and other diseases  e.g. pernicious\\nanaemia, aplastic anaemia, cirrhosis of the liver with spleno-\\nmegaly, SLE, Gaucher’s disease.\\n5.Cachexia and debility.\\n6.Anaphylactoid shock.\\n7.Certain rare hereditary, congenital or familial disorders  e.g.\\ncyclic neutropenia, primary splenic neutropenia, idiopathic\\nbenign neutropenia.\\nVARIATIONS IN MORPHOLOGY.  Some of the common\\nvariations in neutrophil morphology are shown in Fig. 14.7.\\nThese are as under:\\n1. Granules.  Heavy, dark staining, coarse toxic granules are\\ncharacteristic of bacterial infections.2.\\nVacuoles.  In bacterial infections such as in septicaemia,\\ncytoplasmic vacuolation may develop.\\n3. Döhle bodies.  These are small, round or oval patches,\\n2-3 μm in size, in the cytoplasm. They are mostly seen in\\nbacterial infections.\\n4. Nuclear abnormalities.  These include the following:\\ni)Sex chromatin  is a normal finding in 2-3% of neutrophils\\nin female sex. It consists of a drumstick appendage of\\nchromatin, about 1 μm across, and attached to one of the\\nnuclear lobes by a thin chromatin strand. Their presence inmore than 20% of PMNs is indicative of female sexchromosomes (Chapter 10).\\nii) A ‘shift-to-left’  is the term used for appearance of neutro-\\nphils with decreased number of nuclear lobes in the\\nperipheral blood e.g. presence of band and stab forms and afew myelocytes in the peripheral blood. It is seen in severeinfections, leucoerythroblastic reaction or leukaemia.\\niii) A ‘shift-to-right’  is appearance of hypersegmented (more\\nthan 5 nuclear lobes) neutrophils in the peripheral blood such\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 14.2: Normal White Blood Cell Counts in Health.\\nAbsolute Count\\nTLC\\nAdults 4,000–11,000/ μl\\nInfants (Full term, at birth) 10,000–25,000/ μl\\nInfants (1 year) 6,000–16,000/ μl\\nChildren (4–7 years) 5,000–15,000/ μl\\nChildren (8–12 years) 4,500–13,500/ μl\\nDLC IN ADULTSPolymorphs (neutrophils) 40–75% 2,000–7,500/ μl\\nLymphocytes 20–50% 1,500–4,000/ μl\\nMonocytes 2–10% 200–800/ μl\\nEosinophils 1–6% 40–400/ μl\\nBasophils <l% 10–100/ μl349CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuesas in megaloblastic anaemia, uraemia, and sometimes in\\nleukaemia.\\niv)Pelger-Huët anomaly  is an uncommon autosomal\\ndominant inherited disorder in which nuclei in majority of\\nneutrophils are distinctively bilobed (spectacle-shaped) andcoarsely staining chromatin. Acquired pseudo-Pelger-Huëtabnormality may occur in acute infections or in MDS.However, the physiologic role of multilobed nucleus ofneutrophils is unknown and the bilobed anomaly is aninnocuous condition.\\nDEFECTIVE FUNCTIONS.  The following abnormalities in\\nneutrophil function may sometimes be found:\\n1.Defective chemotaxis  e.g. in a rare congenital abnor-\\nmality called lazy-leucocyte syndrome; following cortico-\\nsteroid therapy, aspirin ingestion, alcoholism, and in myeloidleukaemia.\\n2. Defective phagocytosis  due to lack of opsonisation e.g.\\nin hypogammaglobulinaemia, hypocomplementaemia, after\\nsplenectomy, in sickle cell disease.\\n3.Defective killing  e.g. in chronic granulomatous disease,\\nChédiak-Higashi syndrome, myeloid leukaemias.\\nL\\nymphocytes\\nMORPHOLOGY.  Majority of lymphocytes in the peripheral\\nblood are small  (9-12 μm in diameter) but large  lymphocytes\\n(12-16 μm in diameter) are also found. Both small and large\\nlymphocytes have round or slightly indented nucleus with\\ncoarsely-clumped chromatin and scanty basophiliccytoplasm. Plasma cells are derived from B lymphocytesunder the influence of appropriate stimuli. The nucleus ofplasma cell is eccentric and has cart-wheel pattern of clumpednuclear chromatin. The cytoplasm is characteristically deeplybasophilic with a pale perinuclear zone. Plasma cells arenormally not present in peripheral blood but their patho-logical proliferation occurs in myelomatosis. Reactivelymphocytes (or Turk cells or plasmacytoid lymphocytes)are seen in certain viral infections and have sufficientlybasophilic cytoplasm that they resemble plasma cells.\\n As discussed in Chapter 4, functionally, there are 3 types\\nof lymphocytes and possess distinct surface markers calledclusters of differentiation (CD) which aid in identification ofstage of their differentiation:T lymp hocytes  i.e. thymus-dependent lymphocytes, which\\nmature in the thymus and are also known as thymocytes.\\nThey are mainly involved in direct action on antigens and\\nare therefore involved in cell-mediated immune (CMI) reaction\\nby its subsets such as cytotoxic (killer) T cells (CD3+), CD8+\\nT cells, and delayed hypersensitivity reaction  by CD4+ T cells.\\nB lymphocytes  i.e. bone marrow-dependent or bursa-\\nequivalent lymphocytes  as well as their derivatives, plasmacells, are the source of specific immunoglobulin antibodies.\\nThey are, therefore, involved in humoral immunity (HI) or\\ncirculating immune reactions.\\nNK cells  i.e. natural killer cells are those lymphocytes which\\nmorphologically have appearance of lymphocytes but do not\\npossess functional features of T or B cells. As the name\\nindicates they are identified with ‘ natural ’ or innate immunity\\nand bring about direct ‘ killing ’ of microorganisms\\n(particularly certain viruses) or lysis of foreign body.\\nPATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS.  A rise in the absolute count\\nof lymphocytes exceeding the upper limit of normal (above\\n4,000/ μm) is termed lymphocytosis,  while absolute lympho-\\ncyte count below 1,500/ μm is referred to as lymphopenia.\\nLymphocytosis.  Some of the common causes of lympho-\\ncytosis are as under:\\n1.Certain acute infections  e.g. pertussis, infectious\\nmononucleosis, viral hepatitis, infectious lymphocytosis.2.Certain chronic infections  e.g. brucellosis, tuberculosis,\\nsecondary syphilis.3.Haematopoietic disorders  e.g. lymphocytic leukaemias,\\nlymphoma, heavy chain disease.4.Relative lymphocytosis  is found in viral exanthemas,\\nconvalescence from acute infections, thyrotoxicosis,\\nconditions causing neutropenia.\\nLymphopenia.  Lymphopenia is uncommon and occurs in\\nthe following conditions:\\n1.Most acute infections.\\n2. Severe bone marrow failure.3.Corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy.\\n4.\\nWidespread irradiation.\\nMonocytes\\nMORPHOLOGY.  The monocyte is the largest mature\\nleucocyte in the peripheral blood measuring 12-20 μm inFigure 14.7 Common variations in neutrophil morphology.\\n350SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissuesdiameter. It possesses a large, central, oval, notched or\\nindented or horseshoe-shaped nucleus which hascharacteristically fine reticulated chromatin network. Thecytoplasm is abundant, pale blue and contains many finedust-like granules and vacuoles.\\nThe main  functions  of monocytes are as under:\\n1.Phagocytosis of antigenic material or microorganisms.\\n2. Immunologic function as antigen-presenting cells  and\\npresent the antigen to lymphocytes to deal with further.3. As mediator of inflammation , they are involved in release\\nof prostaglandins, stimulation of the liver to secrete acutephase reactants.\\nTissue macrophages of different types included in RE\\nsystem are derived from blood monocytes (Chapter 4).\\nPATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS.  A rise in the blood mono-\\ncytes above 800/ μl is termed monocytosis.  Some common\\ncauses of monocytosis are as follows:\\n1.Certain bacterial infections  e.g. tuberculosis, subacute\\nbacterial endocarditis, syphilis.\\n2.Viral infections.\\n3.Protozoal and rickettsial infections  e.g. malaria, typhus,\\ntrypanosomiasis, kala-azar.4.Convalescence from acute infection.\\n5.Haematopoietic disorders  e.g. monocytic leukaemia,\\nlymphomas, myeloproliferative disorders, multiple\\nmyeloma, lipid storage disease.\\n6.Malignancies  e.g. cancer of the ovary, stomach, breast.\\n7.Granulomatous diseases  e.g. sarcoidosis, inflammatory\\nbowel disease.\\n8.Collagen-vascular diseases.\\nEosinophils\\nMORPHOLOGY. Eosinophils are similar to segmented\\nneutrophils in size (12-15 μm in diameter), and have coarse,\\ndeep red staining granules in the cytoplasm and have usually\\ntwo nuclear lobes. Granules in eosinophils contain basicprotein and stain more intensely for peroxidase than granulesin the neutrophils. In addition, eosinophils also contain celladhesion molecules, cytokines (IL-3, IL-5), and a protein thatprecipitates Charcot-Leyden crystals in lung tissues inasthmatic patients.\\nEosinophils are involved in reactions to foreign proteins\\nand to antigen-antibody reactions.\\nPATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS.  An increase in the number\\nof eosinophilic leucocytes above 400/ μl is referred to as\\neosinophilia  and below 40/ μl is termed as eosinopenia.\\nEosinophilia.  The causes are as under:\\n1.Allergic disorders e.g. bronchial asthma, urticaria,\\nangioneurotic oedema, hay fever, drug hypersensitivity.\\n2.Parasitic infestations  e.g. trichinosis, echinococcosis,\\nintestinal parasitism.\\n3.Skin diseases  e.g. pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis,\\nerythema multiforme.\\n4.Löeffler’s syndrome.\\n5.Pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia  (PIE) syndrome.\\n6.Tropical eosinophilia.7.Haematopoietic diseases  e.g. CML, polycythaemia vera,\\npernicious anaemia, Hodgkin’s disease, following\\nsplenectomy.\\n8.Malignant diseases  with metastases.\\n9.Irradiation.\\n10. Miscellaneous disorders  e.g. polyarteritis nodosa, rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis, sarcoidosis.\\nEosinopenia.  Adrenal steroids and ACTH induce eosino-\\npenia in man.\\nBasophils\\nMORPHOLOGY.  Basophils resemble the other mature\\ngranulocytes but are distinguished by coarse, intensely\\nbasophilic granules which usually fill the cytoplasm andoften overlie and obscure the nucleus.\\nThe granules of circulating basophils (as well as their\\ntissue counterparts as mast cells) contain heparin, histamineand 5-HT. Mast cells or basophils on degranulation areassociated with histamine release.\\nPATHOLOGIC VARIATIONS.  Basophil leucocytosis or\\nbasophilia  refers to an increase in the number of basophilic\\nleucocytes above 100/ μl. Basophilia is unusual and is found\\nin the following conditions:\\n1.Chronic myeloid leukaemia\\n2.Polycythaemia vera\\n3.\\nMyelosclerosis\\n4. Myxoedema\\n5. Ulcerative colitis6. Following splenectomy\\n7. Hodgkin’s disease\\n8. Urticaria pigmentosa.\\nINFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS\\nInfectious mononucleosis (IM) or glandular fever is a benign,\\nself-limiting lymphoproliferative disease caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), one of the herpesviruses. Infection mayoccur from childhood to old age but the classical acuteinfection is more common in teenagers and young adults.The infection is transmitted by person-to-person contact suchas by kissing with transfer of virally-contaminated saliva.Groups of cases occur particularly in young people livingtogether in boarding schools, colleges, camps and militaryinstitutions. Primary infection in childhood is generallyasymptomatic, while 50% of adults develop clinicalmanifestations. The condition is so common that by the ageof 40, most people have been infected and developedantibodies. It may be mentioned here that EBV is oncogenicas well and is strongly implicated in the African (endemic)Burkitt’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma asdiscussed in Chapter 8.\\nPathogenesis\\nEBV, the etiologic agent for IM, is a B lymphotropic\\nherpesvirus. The disease is characterised by fever, genera-lised lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, sore throat,351CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuesand appearance in blood of atypical ‘mononucleosis cells’.\\nThe pathogenesis of these pathologic features is outlinedbelow:\\n1. In a susceptible sero-negative host who lacks antibodies,\\nthe virus in the contaminated saliva invades and replicates\\nwithin epithelial cells of the salivary gland and then enters B\\ncells in the lymphoid tissues which possess receptors for EBV.The infection spreads throughout the body via bloodstreamor by infected B cells.\\n2. Viraemia and death of infected B cells cause an acute\\nfebrile illness and appearance of specific humoral antibodieswhich peak about 2 weeks after the infection and persistthroughout life. The appearance of antibodies marks thedisappearance of virus from the blood.\\n3. Though the viral agent has disappeared from the blood,\\nthe EBV-infected B cells continue to be present in thecirculation as latent infection. EBV-infected B cells undergo\\npolyclonal activation and proliferation.  These cells perform two\\nimportant roles which are the characteristic diagnosticfeatures of IM:i) They secrete antibodies —initially IgM but later IgG class\\nantibodies appear. IgM antibody is the heterophile anti-sheep antibody used for diagnosis of IM while IgGantibody persists for life and provides immunity againstre-infection.\\nii) They activate CD8+  T lymphocytes — also called cytotoxic\\nT cells (or CTL) or suppressor T cells. CD8+ T cells bringabout killing of B cells and are pathognomonic atypicallymphocytes seen in blood in IM.4. The proliferation of these cells is responsible for\\ngeneralised lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.\\n5. The sore throat  in IM may be caused by either necrosis of\\nB cells or due to viral replication within the salivary epithelial\\ncells in early stage.\\nBesides the involvement of EBV in the pathogenesis of\\nIM, its role in neoplastic transformation in nasopharyngealcarcinoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma is discussed inChapter 8 and diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 14.8.\\nClinical Features\\nThe incubation period of IM is 30-50 days in young adults,\\nwhile children have shorter incubation period. A prodromal\\nperiod of 3-5 days is followed by Frank clinical featureslasting for 1-3 weeks, and subsequently complete recoveryoccurs after 2 months. The usual clinical features are as\\nunder:\\n1.During prodromal period (first 3-5 days),  the symptoms\\nare mild such as malaise, myalgia, headache and fatigue.2. Frank clinical features (next 7-21 days) commonly are\\nfever, sore throat and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy.\\nLess commonly, splenomegaly (50% patients), hepatomegaly\\n(10% cases), transient erythematous maculopapular eruptionon the trunk and e xtremities, and neurologic manifestations\\nare found. Pneumonia and cardiac involvement are\\ninfrequent. One of the complications of IM is proneness forsplenic rupture due to splenitis.\\nFigure 14.8 The role of EBV in the pathogenesis of infectious mononucleosis, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma.\\n352SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular TissuesLaboratory Findings\\nThe diagnosis of IM is made by characteristic haemato-\\nlogic and serologic findings.\\n1.HAEMATOLOGIC FINDINGS.  Major abnormalities\\nin blood are as under:\\ni) TLC:  There is a moderate rise in total white cell count\\n(10,000-20,000/ μl) during 2nd to 3rd week after infection.\\nii) DLC:  There is an absolute lymphocytosis. The lympho-\\ncytosis is due to rise in normal as well as atypical T\\nlymphocytes. There is relative neutropenia.\\niii) Atypical T cells:  Out of the total lymphocytes in the\\nperipheral blood, essential to the diagnosis of IM is the\\npresence of at least 10-12% atypical T cells (or mononucleosis\\ncells)  (Fig. 14.9).  The mononucleosis cells are variable in\\nappearance and are classed as Downey type I, II and III,of which Downey type I are found most frequently. Theseatypical T lymphocytes are usually of the size of largelymphocytes (12-16 μm diameter). The nucleus, rather\\nthan the usual round configuration, is oval, kidney-shapedor slightly lobate due to indentation of nuclear membraneand contains relatively fine chromatin without nucleoli,suggesting an immature pattern but short of leukaemicfeatures. The cytoplasm is more abundant, basophilic andfinely granular and may contain vacuoles. The greatestnumber of atypical lymphocytes is found between 7th to10th day of the illness and these cells may persist in theblood for up to 2 months.\\niv) CD 4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. There is reversal of\\nCD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. There is marked decrease in\\nCD4+ T cells while there is substantial rise in CD8+ T cells.\\nv) Platelets.  There is generally thrombocytopenia in the\\nfirst 4 weeks of illness.\\n2. SEROLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.  The second characteristic\\nlaboratory finding is the demonstration of antibodies in\\nthe serum of infected patient. These are as under:\\ni) Test for heterophile antibodies.  Heterophile antibody\\ntest (Paul-Bunnell test) is used for making the diagnosis\\nof IM. In this test, patient’s serum is absorbed with guineapig kidney. Serum dilutions are prepared which are usedfor agglutination of red cells of sheep, horse or cow andare reported as heterophile titer of test serum. A highserum titer of 40 or more times is diagnostic of acute IMinfection in symptomatic case in the first week.Heterophile antibodies peak during the 3rd week in 80-90% cases. The test remains positive for about 3 monthsafter the illness started.  Thus, the test has to be repeatedlyperformed. Similar antibody is also produced in patientssuffering from serum sickness and has to be distinguishedby differential absorption studies. Heterophile antibodiesare not demonstrable in children under 5 years of age orin quite elderly. Currently, more sensitive and rapid kit-based test for heterophile antibodies, monospot, is alsoavailable.\\nii) EBV-specific antibody tests.  Specific antibodies against\\nthe viral capsid and nucleus of EBV can be demonstrated\\nin patients who are negative for heterophile antibody test:a) Specific antibody against EBV capsid antigen  show elevated\\ntiters in over 90% cases during acute infection.  IgM classantibody appears early and is thus most useful fordiagnosis of acute infection. IgG class antibody appearslater and persists throughout life; thus it does not havediagnostic value but is instead used for assessing the pastexposure to EBV infection.\\nb) Antibodies against EBV nuclear antigen  are detected 3 to\\n6 weeks after infection and, like IgG class antibodies,\\npersist throughout life.\\nc) Antibodies to early antigens  may be elevated but are less\\nuseful for making diagnosis of IM. However, titers of these\\nantibodies remain elevated for 3 to 6 months and theirlevels are high in cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma andAfrican Burkitt’s lymphoma.\\nd) IgA antibodies to EBV antigen  are seen in patients of\\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma or those who are at high risk\\nof developing this EBV-induced cancer.\\niii) EBV antigen detection.  Detection of EBV DNA or\\nproteins can be done in blood or CSF by PCR method.\\n3. LIVER FUNCTION TESTS.  In addition, abnormalities\\nof the liver function test are found in about 90% of cases.\\nThese include elevated serum levels of transaminases(SGOT and SGPT), rise in serum alkaline phosphatase andmild elevation of serum bilirubin.\\nLEUKAEMOID REACTIONS\\nLeukaemoid reaction is defined as a reactive excessive leuco-\\ncytosis in the peripheral blood resembling that of leukaemiain a subject who does not have leukaemia. In spite ofconfusing blood picture, the clinical features of leukaemiasuch as splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and haemorrhagesare usually absent and the features of underlying disordercausing the l eukaemoid reaction are generally obvious.\\nLeukaemoid reaction may be myeloid or lymphoid; the\\nformer is much more common.Figure 14.9 Peripheral blood film showing atypical lymphocytes in\\ninfectious mononucleosis.\\n353CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular TissuesMyeloid Leukaemoid Reaction\\nCAUSES.  Majority of leukaemoid reactions involve the\\ngranulocyte series. It may occur in association with a wide\\nvariety of diseases. These are as under:\\n1.Infections  e.g. staphylococcal pneumonia, disseminated\\ntuberculosis, meningitis, diphtheria, sepsis, endocarditis,\\nplague, infected abortions etc.\\n2.Intoxication  e.g. eclampsia, mercury poisoning, severe\\nburns.3.Malignant diseases  e.g. multiple myeloma, myelofibrosis,\\nHodgkin’s disease, bone metastases.\\n4.Severe haemorrhage and severe haemolysis.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  Myeloid leukaemoid reaction\\nis characterised by the following laboratory features:\\n1.Leucocytosis,  usually moderate, not exceeding 100,000/\\nμl.\\n2.Proportion of immature cells  mild to moderate,\\ncomprised by metamyelocytes, myelocytes (5-15%), and\\nblasts fewer than 5% i.e. the blood picture simulatessomewhat with that of CML (Fig. 14.10, A).\\n3. Infective cases may show toxic granulation and Döhle\\nbodies  in the cytoplasm of neutrophils.\\n4.Neutrophil (or Leucocyte) alkaline phosphatase (NAP or LAP)\\nscore  in the cytoplasm of mature neutrophils in leukaemoid\\nreaction is characteristically high and is very useful todistinguish it from chronic myeloid leukaemia in doubtfulcases  (Fig. 14.10, B).\\n5.Cytogenetic studies  may be helpful in exceptional cases\\nwhich reveal negative Philadelphia chromosome inmyeloid leukaemoid reaction but positive in cases of CML.\\n6.Additional features  include anaemia, normal-to-raised\\nplatelet count, myeloid hyperplasia of the marrow andabsence of infiltration by immature cells in organs and\\ntissues.\\nTable 14.3  sums up the features to distinguish myeloid\\nleukaemoid reaction from chronic myeloid leukaemia.\\nLymphoid Leukaemoid Reaction\\nCAUSES.  Lymphoid leukaemoid reaction may be found in\\nthe following conditions:\\n1.Infections  e.g. infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus\\ninfection, pertussis (whooping cough), chickenpox, measles,\\ninfectious lymphocytosis, tuberculosis.\\n2.Malignant diseases  may rarely produce lymphoid\\nleukaemoid reaction.\\nLABORATORY FINDINGS.  The blood picture is\\ncharacterised by the following findings:\\n1.Leucocytosis not exceeding 100,000/ μl.\\n2.\\nThe differential white cell count reveals mostly mature\\nlymphocytes simulating the blood picture found in cases\\nof CLL.\\nHAEMATOLOGIC NEOPLASMS\\n(LEUKAEMIAS-LYMPHOMAS): GENERAL\\nCLASSIFICATION: CURRENT CONCEPTS\\nNeoplastic proliferations of white blood cells— leukaemias\\nand lymphomas, are the most important group of leucocytedisorders.\\nHistorically, leukaemias  have been classified on the basis\\nof cell types predominantly involved into myeloid  and\\nlymphoid,  and on the basis of natural history of the disease,\\ninto acute  and chronic.  Thus, the main types of leukaemias\\nhave been: acute myeloblastic leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic\\nFigure 14.10 Leukaemoid reaction. A, Peripheral blood film showing marked neutrophilic leucocytosis accompanied with late precursors of\\nmyeloid series. B, Neutrophil (or leucocyte) alkaline phosphatase (NAP or LAP) activity is higher as demonstrated by this cytoc hemical stain.\\n354SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nleukaemia  (AML and ALL), and chronic myeloid leukaemia and\\nchronic lymphocytic leukaemias  (CML and CLL); besides there\\nare some other uncommon variants. In general, acute\\nleukaemias are characterised by predominance of\\nundifferentiated leucocyte precursors or leukaemic blasts and\\nhave a rapidly downhill course. Chronic leukaemias, on theother hand, have easily recognisable late precursor series ofleucocytes circulating in large number as the predominant\\nleukaemic cell type and the patients tend to have more\\nindolent behaviour. The incidence of both acute and chronicleukaemias is higher in men than in women. ALL is primarilya disease of children and young adults, whereas AML occurs\\nat all ages. CLL tends to occur in the elderly, while CML is\\nfound in middle age.\\nSimilary, over the years, lymphomas  which are malignant\\ntumours of lymphoreticular tissues have been categorised\\ninto two distinct clinicopathologic groups: Hodgkin’s\\nlymphoma  or Hodgkin’s disease (HD) characterised by\\npathognomonic presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, and a\\nheterogenous group of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL).\\nIn the last 50 years, several classification systems have\\nbeen proposed for leukaemias and lymphomas—cliniciansfavouring an approach based on clinical findings whilepathologists have been interested in classifying them on\\nmorphologic features. More recent classification schemes\\nhave been based on cytochemistry, immunophenotyping,cytogenetics and molecular markers which have becomeavailable to pathologists and haematologists. The most recent\\nclassification scheme proposed by the World Health\\nOrganisation (WHO) in 2002  combines all tumours ofhaematopoietic and lymphoid tissues together. The basis ofthe WHO classification is the cell type of the neoplasm  as\\nidentified by combined approach of clinical features andmorphologic, cytogenetic and molecular characteristics,rather than location of the neoplasm (whether in blood or in\\ntissues) because of the fact that haematopoietic cells arepresent in circulation as well as in tissues in general, and\\nlymphoreticular tissues in particular.Currently, neoplasms of haematopoietic and lymphoid\\ntissues are considered as a unified group and are dividedinto 3 broad categories:\\nI. Myeloid neoplasms:  This group includes neoplasms of\\nmyeloid cell lineage and therefore includes neoplastic\\nproliferations of red blood cells, platelets, granulocytes andmonocytes. There are 5 categories under myeloid series ofneoplasms: myeloproliferative disorders, myeloprolife-rative/myelodysplastic diseases, myelodysplasticsyndromes (MDS), and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML),acute biphenotypic leukaemias.\\nII. Lymphoid neoplasms:  Neoplasms of lymphoid lineage\\ninclude leukaemias and lymphomas of B, T or NK cell origin.\\nThis group thus includes B cell neoplasms (including plasmacell disorders), T cell neoplasms, NK cell neoplasms andHodgkin’s disease.\\nIII. Histiocytic neoplasms:  This group is of interest mainly\\ndue to neoplastic proliferations of histiocytes in Langerhans\\ncell histiocytisis.\\nBesides the WHO classification, the FAB (French-\\nAmerican-British) Cooperative Group classification oflymphomas and leukaemias based on morphology andcytochemistry is also widely used.\\nThese as well as other classification schemes have been\\ntabulated and discussed later under separate headings ofmyeloid and lymphoid malignancies.\\nETIOLOGY\\nLike in most cancers, the exact etiology of leukaemias and\\nlymphomas is not known. However, a number of factors havebeen implicated:\\n1. HEREDITY.  There is evidence to suggest that there is\\nrole of family history, occurrence in identical twins and\\npredisposition of these malignancies in certain geneticsyndromes:\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 14.3: Contrasting Features of Leukaemoid Reaction and Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia.\\nFeature Leukaemoid Reaction CML\\n1.

Hodgkin’s disease is 99 times more common inidentical twin of an affected case compared with generalpopulation, implicating genetic origin strongly.\\nii) Family history . Families with excessive incidence of\\nleukaemia have been identified.\\niii) Genetic disease association . Acute leukaemia occurs with\\nincreased frequency with a variety of congenital disorders\\nsuch as Down’s, Bloom’s, Klinefelter’s and Wiskott-Aldrich’ssyndromes, Fanconi’s anaemia and ataxia telangiectasia.Hodgkin’s disease has familial incidence and with certainHLA type.\\n2. INFECTIONS.  There is evidence to suggest that certain\\ninfections, particularly viruses, are involved in development\\nof lymphomas and leukaemias (Chapter 8):\\ni)Human T cell leukaemia-lymphoma virus I (HTLV-I)\\nimplicated in etiology of adult T cell leukaemia-lymphoma\\n(ATLL).\\ni\\ni) HTLV II  for T cell variant of hairy cell leukaemia.\\niii)Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)  implicated in the etiology of\\nHodgkin’s disease (mixed cellularity type and nodular\\nsclerosis type), endemic variety of Burkitt’s lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoma,\\niv) HIV  in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt’s\\nlymphoma.\\nv) Hepatitis C virus (HCV)  in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.\\nvi) Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8)  in primary effusion\\nlymphoma.\\nvii) Helicobacter pylori   bacterial infection of gastric mucosa\\nin MALT lymphoma of the stomach.\\n3. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.  Certain environmental\\nfactors are known to play a role in the etiology of leukaemias\\nand lymphomas:\\ni)Ionising radiation.  Damage due to radiation exposure\\nhas been linked to development of leukaemias and\\nlymphomas.  Individuals exposed to occupational radiationexposure, patients receiving radiation therapy, and Japanesesurvivors of the atomic bomb explosions have been found tobe at higher risk of developing haematopoietic malignancies,particularly prone to development of CML, AML and ALLbut not to CLL or hairy cell leukaemia.\\ni\\ni) Chemical carcinogens.  Benzene, tobacco smoking,\\nalcohol, use of certain hair dyes and exposure to agriculture\\nchemicals are associated with increased risk of developmentof haematopoietic malignancies.\\niii) Certain drugs. Long-term exposure to certain drugs such\\nas phenytoin, alkylating agents and other chemotherapeutic\\nagents is associated with increased incidence of leukaemiasand lymphomas. Patients treated for Hodgkin’s disease candevelop NHL.\\n4. ASSOCIATION WITH DISEASES OF IMMUNITY.\\nSince lymphoid cells are the immune cells of the body,diseases with derangements of the immune system havehigher incidence of haematopoietic malignancies:i) Immunodeficiency diseases.  Various inherited and\\nacquired immunodeficiency diseases including AIDS andiatrogenic immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy orradiation, are associated with subsequent development oflymphomatous transformation.\\nii) Autoimmune disease association.  A few autoimmune\\ndiseases such as Sjögren’s syndrome, nontropical sprue,\\nrheumatoid arthritis and SLE are associated with higherincidence of NHL.\\nPATHOGENESIS\\nIt needs to be emphasised that since haematopoietic cells\\nhave a rapid turnover, they are more vulnerable tochromosomal damages and cytogenetic changes underinfluence of various etiologic factors listed above.\\n1. Genetic damage to single clone of target cells.  Leukaemias\\nand lymphomas arise following malignant transformation\\nof a single clone of cells belonging to myeloid or lymphoid\\nseries, followed by proliferation of the transformed clone.Basic mechanism of malignant transformation is geneticdamage to the DNA of the target white cells followed byproliferation, disrupting normal growth and differentiation.The heritable genetic damage may be induced by various\\netiologic agents listed above (e.g. RNA viruses HTLV-I, EBVetc) and causes insertional mutagenesis for which oncogenesmay play a role (Chapter 8). The evolution of leukaemia ismulti-step process, and in many cases, acute leukaemia maydevelop after a pre-existing myelodysplastic ormyeloproliferative disorder.\\n2.\\nChromosomal translocations.  A number of cytogenetic\\nabnormalities have been detected in cases of leukaemias-\\nlymphomas, most consistent of which are chromosomaltranslocations. In NHL, translocation involving antigenreceptor genes, immunoglobulin genes, or overexpressionof BCL -2 protein may be seen. The most consistent\\nchromosomal abnormality in various forms of acute andchronic leukaemias is Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome seenin 70-90% cases with CML, involving reciprocal translocationof parts of long arm of chromosome 22 to the long arm ofchromosome 9 i.e. t(9;22) (Fig. 14.11).\\n3.Maturation defect. In acute leukaemia, the single most\\nprominent characteristic of the leukaemic cells is a defect inmaturation beyond the myeloblast or promyelocyte level inAML, and the lymphoblast level in ALL. It needs to beemphasised that it is the maturation defect  in leukaemic\\nblasts rather than rapid proliferation of leukaemic cellsresponsible for causing acute leukaemia. In fact, thegeneration time of leukaemic blasts is somewhat prolongedrather than shortened.\\n4.Myelosuppression.  As the leukaemic cells accumulate\\nin the bone marrow, there is suppression of normal\\nhaematopoietic stem cells, partly by physically replacing the\\nnormal marrow precursors, and partly by inhibiting normalhaematopoiesis via cell-mediated or humoral mechanisms.This is based on the observation that some patients with acuteleukaemia have a hypocellular marrow indicating that356SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nmarrow failure is not due to overcrowding by leukaemic cells\\nalone. Nevertheless, some normal haematopoietic stem cellsdo remain in the marrow which are capable of proliferatingand restoring normal haematopoiesis after effective anti-leukaemic treatment.\\n5. Organ infiltration.  The leukaemic cells proliferate\\nprimarily in the bone marrow, circulate in the blood andinfiltrate into other tissues such as lymph nodes, liver, spleen,\\nskin, viscera and the central nervous system.\\n6. Cytokines. Presence of reactive inflammatory cells in the\\nHodgkin’s disease is due to secretion of cytokines from the\\nReed Sternberg cells e.g. IL-5 (growth factor for eosinophils),IL-13 (for autocrine stimulation of RS cells) and transforminggrowth factor- β (for fibrogenesis).\\nMYELOID NEOPLASMS\\nBased on the cell line of differentiation of the pluripotent\\nstem cell, the WHO classification (2002) recognises all\\nhaematopoieitc neoplasms into 2 groups: myeloid and\\nlymphoid neoplasms. Since myeloid trilineage stem cellsfurther differentiate into 3 series of progenitor cells: erythroid,granulocyte-monocyte, and megakaryocytic series, thereforeall examples of myeloid neoplasms fall into these threecategories of cell-lines.  Based on this concept, the WHO\\nclassification of myeloid neoplasms includes following 5\\ngroups (Fig. 14.12):\\nI. Myeloproliferative diseasesII.Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases\\nIII. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)IV. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)\\nV.\\nAcute biphenotypic leukaemia\\nEach of these groups is subclassifed into further types as\\nshown in  Table 14.4.  Important examples within each group\\nare discussed below.\\nMYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISEASES\\nThe myeloproliferative disorders are a group of neoplastic\\nproliferation of multipotent haematopoietic stem cells.Besides their common stem cell origin, these disorders areclosely related, occasionally leading to evolution of one entityinto another during the course of the disease.Figure 14.11 The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. There is reciprocal\\ntranslocation of the part of the long arms of chromosome 22 to the long\\narms of chromosome 9 written as t(9;22).\\nFigure 14.12 Maturation stages of myeloid cells and stages in development of myeloid neoplasms.\\n357CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nThe WHO classification of myeloproliferative disorders\\nincludes 7 types as shown in  Table 14.4.  Classic and common\\nexamples are chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML),\\npolycythaemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocytosis (ET),each one representing corresponding excess of granulocytes,red blood cells, and platelets, respectively. The group as awhole has slow and insidious onset of clinical features andindolent clinical behaviour.\\nCHRONIC MYELOID LEUKAEMIA (CML)\\nDefinition and Pathophysiology\\nBy WHO definition, CML is established by identification of\\nthe clone of haematopoietic stem cell that possesses thereciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22,forming Philadelphia chromosome. The t(9;22)  involvesfusi on of BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on\\nchromosome 22q11 with ABL (named after Abelson murine\\nleukaemia virus) gene located on chromosome 9q34. Thefusion product so formed is termed “Ph chromosome t(9;22)(q34;11), BCR/ABL” which should be positive for makingthe diagnosis of CML. This identification may be done by\\nmicrosatellite PCR or by FISH. The underlying patho-\\nphysiologic mechanism of human CML is based on theobservation that BCR/ABL fusion product proteins arecapable of transforming haematopoietic progenitor cells in\\nvitro  and form malignant clone. BCR/ABL fusion product\\nbrings about following functional changes:\\ni) ABL protein is activated to function as a tyrosine kinase\\nenzyme that in turn activates other kinases which inhibits\\napoptosis .\\nii) Ability of ABL to act as DNA-binding protein  is altered.\\niii) Binding of ABL to actin microfilaments  of the cytoskeleton\\nis increased.\\nExact mechanism of progression of CML to the blastic\\nphase is unclear but following mechanisms may be involved:i) Structural alterations in tumour suppressor p53 gene.\\nii\\n) Structural alterations in tumour suppressor Rb gene.\\niii) Alterations in RAS oncogene.\\niv) Alterations in MYC  oncogene.\\nv) Release of cytokine IL-1β.\\nvi) Functional inactivation of tumour suppressor protein,phosphatase A2 .\\nClinical Features\\nChronic myeloid (myelogenous, granulocytic) leukaemia\\ncomprises about 20% of all leukaemias and its peak incidence\\nis seen in 3rd and 4th decades of life. A distinctive variant ofCML seen in children is called juvenile CML.  Both sexes are\\naffected equally. The onset of CML is generally insidious.Some of the common presenting manifestations are as under:1. Features of anaemia  such as weakness, pallor, dyspnoea\\nand tachycardia.2. Symptoms due to hypermetabolism  such as weight loss,\\nlassitude, anorexia, night sweats.3.Splenomegaly  is almost always present and is frequently\\nmassive. In some patients, it may be associated with acutepain due to splenic infarction.\\n4.Bleeding tendencies  such as easy bruising, epistaxis,\\nmenorrhagia and haematomas may occur.\\n5.Less common  features include gout, visual disturbance,\\nneurologic manifestations and priapism.6.Juvenile CML  is more often associated with lymph node\\nenlargement than splenomegaly. Other features are frequent\\ninfections, haemorrhagic manifestations and facial rash.\\nLaboratory Findings\\nThe diagnosis of CML is generally possible on blood\\npicture alone. However, bone marrow, cytochemical stainsand other investigations are of help.\\nI. BLOOD PICTURE.  The typical blood picture in a case\\nof CML at the time of presentation shows the following\\nfeatures (Fig. 14.13):\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 14.4: WHO Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms.\\nI.

ACUTE BIPHENOTYPIC LEUKAEMIA358SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues1. Anaemia.  Anaemia is usually of moderate degree and\\nis normocytic normochromic in type. Occasional\\nnormoblasts may be present.\\n2. White blood cells.  Characteristically, there is marked\\nleucocytosis (approximately 200,000/ μl or more at the\\ntime of presentation). The natural history of CML consists\\nof 3 phases—chronic, accelerated, and blastic.\\nChronic phase of CML  begins as a myeloproliferative\\ndisorder and consists of excessive proliferation of myeloid\\ncells of intermediate grade (i.e. myelocytes and\\nmetamyelocytes) and mature segmented neutrophils.\\nMyeloblasts usually do not exceed 10% of cells in theperipheral blood and bone marrow. An increase in the\\nproportion of basophils up to 10% is a characteristic\\nfeature of CML. A rising basophilia  is indicative of\\nimpending blastic transformation. An accelerated phase of\\nCML  is also described in which there is progressively\\nrising leucocytosis associated with thrombocytosis orthrombocytopenia and splenomegaly.\\nAccelerated phase  is defined as increasing degree of\\nanaemia, blast count in blood or marrow between 10-20%,marrow basophils 20% or more, and platelet count falling\\nbelow 1,00,000/ μl.\\n  Blastic phase or blast crisis in CML  fulfills the definition\\nof acute leukaemia in having blood or marrow blasts\\n>20%. These blast cells may be myeloid, lymphoid,erythroid or undifferentiated and are established by\\nmorphology, cytochemistry, or immunophenotyping.\\nMyeloid blast crisis in CML is more common and\\nresembles AML. However, unlike AML, Auer rods arenot seen in myeloblasts of CML in blast crisis.\\n3.  Platelets.  Platelet count may be normal but is raised in\\nabout half the cases.\\nII.  BONE MARROW EXAMINATION.  Examination of\\nmarrow aspiration yields the following results:\\n1. Cellularity.  Generally, there is hypercellularity with\\ntotal or partial replacement of fat spaces by proliferating\\nmyeloid cells.2. Myeloid cells.  The myeloid cells predominate in the\\nbone marrow with increased myeloid-erythroid ratio. Thedifferential counts of myeloid cells in the marrow showsimilar findings as seen in the peripheral blood withpredominance of myelocytes.\\n3. Erythropoiesis.  Erythropoiesis is normoblastic but there\\nis reduction in erythropoietic cells.\\n4. Megakaryocytes.  Megakaryocytes are conspicuous but\\nare usually smaller in size than normal.\\n5. Cytogenetics.  Cytogenetic studies on blood and bone\\nmarrow cells show the characteristic chromosomal\\nabnormality called Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome seenin 90-95% cases of CML. Ph chromosome is formed byreciprocal balanced translocation between part of long armof chromosome 22 and part of long arm of chromosome9{(t(9;22) (q34;11)} forming product of fusion gene, BCR/ABL ( see Fig. 14.11) .\\nIII. CYTOCHEMISTRY.  The only significant finding on\\ncytochemical stains is reduced scores of neutrophil alkaline\\nphosphatase (NAP)  which helps to distinguish CML from\\nmyeloid leukaemoid reaction in which case NAP scoresare elevated (see Fig. 14.10,B, and Table 14.3) . However,\\nNAP scores in CML return to normal with successfultherapy, corticosteroid administration and in infections.\\nIV. OTHER INVESTIGATIONS.  A few other accompa-\\nnying findings are seen in CML:\\n1. Elevated serum B\\n12 and vitamin B12 binding capacity.\\n2. Elevated serum uric acid (hyperuricaemia).\\nTreatment and Complications\\nInsight into molecular mechanism of CML has brought about\\nmajor changes in its therapy. The approach of moderntherapy in CML is targetted at removal of all malignant clonesof cells bearing BCR/ABL fusion protein, so that patientreverts back to prolonged non-clonal haematopoiesis i.e.molecular remission from disease. This is achievable by thefollowing approaches:Figure 14.13 PBF findings in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).\\n359CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues1. Imatinib oral therapy:  The basic principle underlying\\nimatinib oral treatment is to competitively inhibit ATP\\nbinding site of the ABL kinase, which in turn, inhibits signaltransduction BCR/ABL fusion protein. Imatinib inducesapoptosis in BCR/ABL-positive cells and thus eliminatesthem. Imatinib is found more effective in newly diagnosedcases of CML. Complete haematologic remission is achievedfor 18 months in 97% cases treated with imatinib.\\n2. Allogenic bone marrow (stem cell) transplantation.\\nAlthough this treatment modality offers proven cure, it iscomplicated with mortality due to procedure anddevelopment of post-transplant graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) and, therefore, post-transplant immunosuppressivetreatment has to be continued.\\n3. Interferon- α. Prior to  imatinib and allogenic trans-\\nplantation, chronic phase of CML used to be treated with\\ninterferon- α was the drug of choice.\\n4. Chemotherapy.  Chemotherapeutic agents are used in\\ntreatment of CML for lowering the total population of WBCs.These include use of busulfan, cyclophosphamide(melphalan) and hydroxyurea.\\n5. Others.  Besides above, other forms of treatment include\\nsplenic irradiation, splenectomy and leucopheresis.\\nThe most common cause of death (in 80% cases) in CML\\nis disease acceleration and blastic transformation.\\nPOLYCYTHAEMIA VERA\\nDefinition and Pathophysiology\\nPolycythaemia vera (PV) is a clonal disorder characterised\\nby increased production of all myeloid elements resulting inpancytosis (i.e increased red cells, granulocytes, platelets) inthe absence of any recognisable cause. The term‘polycythaemia vera’ or ‘polycythaemia rubra vera’ is usedfor primary or idiopathic polycythaemia  only and is the most\\ncommon of all the myeloproliferative disorders. Secondary\\npolycythaemia or erythrocytosis,  on the other hand, may occur\\nsecondary to several causes e.g. high altitude, cardiovasculardisease, pulmonary disease with alveolar hypoventilation,heavy smoking, inappropriate increase in erythropoietin(renal cell carcinoma, hydronephrosis, hepatocellular carci-noma, cerebellar haemangioblastoma, massive uterineleiomyoma); sometimes relative or spurious polycythaemiamay result from plasma loss such as in burns and indehydration from vomiting or water deprivation. None ofthe secondary causes of polycythaemia is associated withsplenic enlargement or increased leucocytes and plateletswhich are typical of PV.\\nThe exact etiology of PV is not known but about a third\\nof cases show inconsistent and varied chromosomalabnormalities such as 20q, trisomy 8 and 9p. Majorpathogenetic mechanism is a tyrosine kinase JAK2 mutationwhich removes the autoinhibitory control and activates thekinases.\\nClinical Features\\nPV is a disease of late middle life and is slightly more\\ncommon in males. The disease generally runs a chronic butslowly progressive course. Clinical features are the result ofhyperviscosity, hypervolaemia, hypermetabolism anddecreased cerebral perfusion. These are as under:\\n1.Headache, vertigo, tinnitus, visual alterations syncope\\nor even coma.\\n2.Increased risk of thrombosis due to accelerated athero-\\nsclerosis.3.\\nIncreased risk of haemorrhages due to increased blood\\nvolume and intrinsic platelet dysfunction e.g. epistaxis,\\npeptic ulcer disease.\\n4. Splenomegaly producing abdominal fullness.\\n5. Pruritus, especially after a bath.6. Increased risk of urate stones and gout due to\\nhyperuricaemia.\\nLaboratory Findings\\nPV is diagnosed by the following haematologic findings:\\n1. Raised haemoglobin concentration (above 17.5 g/dl in\\nmales and 15.5 g/dl in females).\\n2. Erythrocytosis (above 6 million/ μl in males and\\n5.5 million/ μl in females).\\n3. Haematocrit (PCV) above 55% in males and above 47%\\nin females.\\n4. Mild to moderate leucocytosis (15,000-25,000/ μl) with\\nbasophilia and raised neutrophil alkaline phosphatase\\nscores.\\n5. Thrombocytosis with defective platelet function.6. Bone marrow examination reveals erythroid hyper-\\nplasia or panhyperplasia.\\n7. Cytogenetic abnormalities such as 20q,  trisomy 8 and\\n9p are found in 30% cases of PV.\\n 8. In PV, unlike secondary polycythaemia, erythropoietin\\nlevels in serum and urine are reduced.\\nTreatment and Complications\\nSince PV runs an indolent course, therapy is aimed at\\nmaintaining normal blood counts and relieve the patient of\\nsymptoms.\\n1. Phlebotomy (venesection) by blood letting is done at regular\\ninterval to reduce total blood cell mass and to induce a state\\nof iron deficiency.\\n2. Anticoagulant therapy  is adminstered in case thrombosis\\nhas occurred.3. Chemotherapy  may be indicated to induce myelosuppresion.\\n4. Hyperuricaemia is treated with uricosuric drugs .\\n5. Interferon- α is associated with good results because it\\nreduces JAK2 expression in these patients which is the\\nunderlying cytogenetic abnormality.\\nPatients receiving phlebotomy alone may survive for 10-\\n12 years. About 25% patients progress to myelofibrosis. Asmall proportion of patients develop secondary haematologicmali gnancies such as AML, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and\\nmultiple myeloma. Major complication and cause of death\\nin PV is vascular thrombosis.360SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular TissuesESSENTIAL THROMBOCYTHAEMIA\\nDefinition and Pathophysiology\\nEssential thrombocythaemia (ET), also termed essential\\nthrombocytosis or primary (idiopathic) thrombocythaemia\\nis a clonal disorder characterised by markedly elevated\\nplatelet count in the absence of any recognisable stimulus.Secondary or reactive thrombocytosis,  on the other hand, occurs\\nin response to known stimuli such as: chronic infection,\\nhaemorrhage, postoperative state, chronic iron deficiency,\\nmalignancy, rheumatoid arthritis and postsplenectomy.\\nET is an uncommon disorder and represents an\\noverproduction of platelets from megakaryocyte colonies\\nwithout any added stimulus but no clonal marker is available\\nto distinguish primary from secondary thrombocytosis.Though an elevated platelet count is the dominant feature,other cell lines may also be involved in the expansion of\\nneoplastic clone.\\nThe underlying pathophysiologic mechanism in ET is the\\nabsence of control by thrombopoietin that regulates\\nendomitosis in the megakaryocytes to produce platelets. This\\nresults in uncontrolled proliferation of not only mega-\\nkaryocytes but also the platelets. There is probably role ofheredity in ET since families with ET have been reported.\\nClinical Features\\nThe condition has an insidious onset and is more frequent in\\nolder people. Haemorrhagic and thrombotic events are\\ncommon. These include the following:\\n1.Arterial or venous thrombosis.\\n2.Easy bruisability following minor trauma.\\n3.\\nSpontaneous bleeding.\\n4. Transient ischaemic attack or frank stroke due to platelet\\naggregation in microvasculature of the CNS.\\nLaboratory Findings\\nThe prominent laboratory features pertain to platelets.\\nThese include the following:\\n1. Sustained elevation in platelet count (above 400,000 μl).\\n2. Blood film shows many large platelets, megakaryocyte\\nfragments and hypogranular forms.\\n3. Consistently abnormal platelet functions, especially\\nabnormality in platelet aggregation.\\n4. Bone marrow examination reveals a large number of\\nhyperdiploid megakaryocytes and variable amount ofincreased fibrosis.\\nTreatment and Complications\\nET runs a benign course and may not require any therapy.\\nTreatment is given only if platelet count is higher than onemillion. Complications of ET are occurrence of acquired vonWillebrand’s disease and bleeding but incidence of\\nthrombosis is not higher th an matched controls.CHRONIC IDIOP A\\nTHIC MYELOFIBROSIS\\nDefinition and Pathophysiology\\nChronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), also called agnogenic\\n(of unknown origin) myeloid metaplasia, primarymyelofibrosis and myelosclerosis, is a clonal disordercharacterised by proliferation of neoplastic stem cells atmultiple sites outside the bone marrow (i.e. extramedullaryhaematopoiesis), especially in the liver and spleen, withoutan underlying etiology. Secondary myelofibrosis, on the otherhand, develops in association with certain well-definedmarrow disorders, or it is the result of toxic action of chemicalagents or irradiation.\\nThe exact etiology is not known. Several chromosomal\\nabnormalities have been reported but without a specificcytogenetic abnormality. Fibrosis  in the bone marrow is due\\nto overproduction of transforming growth factor- β,\\nosteosclerosis  of the bone is related to osteonectin and marrow\\nangiogenesis is due to increased production of vascular\\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF).\\nClinical Features\\nThe disease begins in the late middle life and is gradual in\\nonset. Both sexes are affected equally. The symptomatologyincludes the following:1.Anaemia with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue,\\nweakness and anorexia.2.\\nMassive splenomegaly producing abdominal discomfort,\\npain and dyspnoea.3. Hepatomegaly is present in half the cases.4. Petechial and other bleeding problems are found in about20% cases.5. Less common findings are lymphadenopathy, jaundice,ascites, bone pain and hyperuricaemia.\\nLaboratory Findings\\n1. Mild anaemia  is usual except in cases where features of\\npolycythaemia vera are coexistent.\\n2. Leucocytosis  at the time of presentation but later there\\nmay be leucopenia.3. Thrombocytosis  initially but advanced cases show\\nthrombocytopenia.4. Peripheral blood smear  shows bizarre red cell shapes, tear\\ndrop poikilocytes, basophilic stippling, nucleated red cells,immature leucocytes (i.e. leucoerythroblastic reaction),basophilia and giant platelet forms.5. Bone marrow aspiration  is generally unsuccessful and\\nyields ‘dry tap’. Examination of trephine biopsy showsfocal areas of hypercellularity and increased reticulinnetwork and variable amount of collagen in which clustersof megakaryocytes are seen well preserved.6. Extramedullary haematopoiesis  can be documented by\\nliver biopsy or splenic aspiration.\\nTreatment and Complications\\nChronic idiopathic myelofibrosis does not require any\\nspecific therapy. Anaemia and ineffective erythropoiesis361CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuescannot be readily treated and do not respond to erythro-\\npoietin, androgens. Splenectomy may be necessary in somecases. In general, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis has pooreroutcome compared with PV and ET.\\nMYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES\\nDefinition and Classification\\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous\\ngroup of haematopoietic clonal stem cell disorders havingabnormal development of different marrow elements (i.e.dysmyelopoiesis), usually characterised by cytopenias,associated with cellular marrow and ineffective blood cellformation. These conditions are, therefore, also termed as\\npreleukaemic syndromes or  dysmyelopoietic syndromes.\\nThere have been two main classification schemes for\\nMDS:\\nFAB CLASSIFICATION OF MDS (1983):  FAB (French-\\nAmerican-British) Cooperative Group classified MDS into\\nthe following 5 groups:\\n1.Refractory anaemia (RA).\\n2. Refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (primary\\nacquired sideroblastic anaemia) (RARS).3. \\nRefractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB).\\n4. Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML).\\n5. Refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in\\ntransformation (RAEB-t).\\nAs per FAB classification, the marrow may contain <30%\\nmyeloblasts in MDS and this was considered as the dividingline for distinguishing cases of AML (blasts >30%) from MDS.\\nWHO CLASSIFICATION OF MDS (2002): According to the\\nWHO classification, patients with blast count of 20-30% and\\nlabelled as RAEB-t (group 5 above) in FAB classification haveprognosis similar to patients with blast count above 30% (i.e.AML cases). Thus, as per WHO classification, marrow blastcount for making the diagnosis of AML has been revisedand brought down to 20%. Thus, patients with FAB categoryof RAEB-t (i.e. group 5 above) are currently considered andtreated as cases of AML and therefore the term RAEB-t standsexcluded from WHO MDS classification. Besides, the WHOclassification excludes CMML (FAB category 4) from MDSand puts in the hybrid category of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder since CMML behaves like amyeloproliferative disorder; moreover refractory anaemia init is not due to erythroid lineage which was considered as aninclusion criteria for MDS. Thus, the WHO classification ofMDS consists of following 8 categories:\\n1. Refractory anaemia (RA):  Same as FAB type 1 MDS.\\nIncidence 5-10%; characterised by anaemia without any blasts\\nin blood; marrow may show <5% blasts.\\n2. Refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts  (RARS):\\nSame as FAB type 2 MDS. Incidence 10-12%; all findings inblood and marrow similar to RA above but in additionmarrow may show \\n>15% ringed sideroblasts.\\n3. Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia(RCMD): New entity. Incidence 24%; blood shows cytopeniaof 2 or 3 cell lineage and monocytosis but no blasts; marrowshows <5% blasts.\\n4. RCMD with ringed sideroblasts (RCMD-RS):  New entity.\\nIncidence 15%; all blood and marrow findings similar to\\nRCMD plus in addition \\n>15% ringed sideroblasts in marrow.\\n5. Refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1):  RAEB\\nof FAB category 3 divided into 2 subtypes with combinedincidence of 40%. RAEB –1 has blood cytopenia with <5%blasts and monocytosis; marrow blast count 5-9%.\\n6. RAEB-2:  Findings of blood and marrow similar to\\nRAEB-1 but marrow blast count is 10-19%.\\n7. Myelodysplastic syndrome unclassified (MDS-U):  New\\nentity in MDS. Blood cytopenia without any blasts; marrow\\nshows dysplasia of myeloid and thrombocytic cell lineageand marrow blast count <5%.\\n8. MDS with isolated del (5q):  New entity in MDS. Anaemia\\nin blood and blasts <5%; marrow blasts <5%, normal or\\nincreased megakaryocytes and characteristic isolateddeletion of 5q.\\nPathophysiology\\nPrimary MDS is idiopathic but factors implicated in etiology\\nare radiation exposure and benzene carcinogen. Secondary(therapy-related) MDS may occur following earlier anti-cancer treatment, aplastic anaemia treated with immuno-suppressive therapy and in Fanconi’s anaemia.  Severalcytogenetic abnormalities are seen in about 50% of MDSwhich include trisomy, translocations and deletions. Casesevolving into leukaemia more often have aneuploidy. Atmolecular level, mutations are seen in N-RAS  oncogene and\\np53 anti-oncogene, which together with suppressed\\nimmunity, accelerate apoptosis in the bone marrow.Mutations in the mitochondrial genes probably account foroccurrence of sideroblastic anaemia in MDS and conse-quently disordered iron metabolism and ineffectiveerythropoiesis.\\nClinical Features\\nIn general, MDS is found more frequently in older people\\npast 6th decade of life, with slight male preponderance.Therapy-related MDS is generally not age-related and mayoccur about a decade after anti-cancer therapy. Clinicalfeatures are quite non-specific and MDS may be discoveredduring routine CBC examination done for some other cause.At presentation the patient may have following features:1.Anaemia appreciated by pallor, fatigue and weakness.\\n2.Fever.\\n3.\\nWeight loss.\\n4. Sweet syndrome having neutrophilic dermatosis seen insome cases.5. Splenomegaly seen in 20% cases of MDS.\\nLaboratory Findings\\nVarious combinations of features are seen in different\\ntypes of MDS. In general, laboratory findings are as under:\\nBLOOD FINDINGS.  There is cytopenia affecting two\\n(bi-)  or all the three blood cell lines (pancytopenia):362SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues1. Anaemia:  Generally macrocytic or dimorphic.\\n2. TLC:  Usually normal; cases of CMML may have high\\nTLC but these cases in WHO classification of myeloid\\nneoplasms have been put in a separate group of myelo-dysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases and not in MDS.\\n3. DLC:  Neutrophils are hyposegmented and hypo-\\ngranulated. Myeloblasts may be seen in PBF and their\\nnumber correlates with marrow blasts count.\\n4. Platelets:  Thrombocytopenia with large agranular\\nplatelets.\\nBONE MARROW FINDINGS. There is constellation of\\nfindings in the marrow as under:\\n1. Cellularity:  Normal to hypercellular to hypocellular.\\n2. Erythroid series:  Dyserythropoiesis as seen by\\nabnormally appearing nuclei and ring sideroblasts.\\nMegaloblasts may be seen.\\n3. Myeloid series:  Hypogranular and hyposegmented\\nmyeloid precursor cells. Myeloblasts increased depending\\nupon the type of MDS.\\n4. Megakaryocyte series:  Reduced in number and having\\nabnormal nuclei.\\nTreatment and Complications\\nMDS is difficult to treat and may not respond to cytotoxic\\nchemotherapy. Stem cell transplantation offers cure andlonger survival. Survival rates vary depending upon thetype of MDS: cases of refractory anaemia with or withoutsideroblasts (RA and RARS) and 5q syndrome survive foryears, while cases of refractory anaemia with excess blasts(RAEB-1 and 2) have poor survival for a few months only.Patients generally either succumb to infections or developinto acute myeloid leukaemia.ACUTE MYELOID LEUKAEMIA\\nDefinition and Pathophysiology\\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease\\ncharacterised by infiltration of malignant myeloid cells intothe blood, bone marrow and other tissues. AML is mainly adisease of adults (median age 50 years), while children andolder individuals may also develop it.\\nAML develops due to inhibition of maturation of myeloid\\nstem cells due to mutations. These mutations may be inducedby several etiologic factors—heredity, radiation, chemicalcarcinogens (tobacco smoking, rubber, plastic, paint,insecticides etc) and long-term use of anti-cancer drugs butviruses do not appear to have role in the etiology of AML.The defect induced by mutations causes accumulation ofprecursor myeloid cells of the stage at which the myeloidmaturation and differentiation is blocked. A few importantexamples of chromosomal mutations in AML aretranslocations {t(8;21)(q22q22) and t(15;17)(q22;q12)}  andinversions { inv(16)(p13;q22)}.\\nClassification\\nCurrently, two main classification schemes for AML are\\nfollowed:\\nFAB CLASSIFICATION.  According to revised FAB\\nclasification system, a leukaemia is acute if the bone marrow\\nconsists of more than 30% blasts. Based on morphology andcytochemistry, FAB classification divides AML into 8subtypes (M0 to M7)  (Table 14.5).\\nWHO CLASSIFICATION (2002).  WHO classification for\\nAML differs from revised FAB classification in the following2 ways:1.It places limited reliance on cytochemistry for making\\nthe diagnosis of subtype of AML but instead takes into\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 14.5: Revised FAB Classification of Acute Myeloblastic Leukaemias.\\nFAB Class Percent Cases Morphology Cytochemistry\\nM0:\\nMinimally 2 Blasts lack definite cytologic and cytochemical Myeloperoxidase –\\ndifferentiated AML features but have myeloid lineage antigens\\nM1: AML without 20 Myeloblasts predominate; few if any Myeloperoxidase +\\nmaturation granules or Auer rods\\nM2: AML with 30 Myeloblasts with promyelocytes predominate; Myeloperoxidase +++\\nmaturation Auer rods may be present\\nM3: Acute promyelocytic 5 Hypergranular promyelocytes; often with Myeloperoxidase +++\\nleukaemia multiple Auer rods per cell\\nM4: Acute myelomonocytic 30 Mature cells of both myeloid and monocytic series Myeloperoxidase ++\\nleukaemia (Naegeli type) in peripheral blood; myeloid cells resemble M2 Non-specific esterase +\\nM5: Acute monocytic 10 Two subtypes: M5a shows poorly-differentiated Non-specific esterase ++\\nleukaemia monoblasts, M5b shows differentiated\\n(Schilling type) promonocytes and monocytes\\nM6: Acute erythroleukaemia <5 Erythroblasts predominate (>50%); myeloblasts Erythroblasts:PAS +\\n(Di Guglielmo’s and promyelocytes also increased Myeloblasts:\\nsyndrome) myeloperoxidase +\\nM7: Acute megakaryocytic <5 Pleomorphic undifferentiated blasts predominate; Platelet peroxidase +\\nleukaemia react with antiplatelet antibodies363CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuesconsideration clinical,  cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities\\nin different types. These features can be studied by\\nmultiparametric flow cytometry.2. WHO classification for AML has revised and lowered thecut off percentage of marrow blasts to 20%  from 30% in the\\nFAB classification for making the diagnosis of AML. WHOclassifcation of AML is included in Table 14.4.\\nBoth FAB as well as WHO classification schemes for AML\\nare followed in different settings depending upon thelaboratory facilities available in various centres. Moreover,most of the current clinical and laboratory data are based onFAB grouping and hence detailed morphologic andcytochemical features of various AML groups are given inTable 14.5.\\nClinical Features\\nAML and ALL share many clinical features and the two are\\ndifficult to distinguish on clinical features alone. In approxi-mately 25% of patients with AML, a preleukaemic syndromewith anaemia and other cytopenias may be present for a fewmonths to years prior to the development of overt leukaemia.\\nClinical manifestations of AML are divided into 2 groups:\\nthose due to bone marrow failure,  and those due to organ\\ninfiltration.\\nI. DUE TO BONE MARROW FAILURE.  These are as\\nunder:\\n1.Anaemia  producing pallor, lethargy, dyspnoea.\\n2.Bleeding manifestations  due to thrombocytopenia causing\\nspontaneous bruises, petechiae, bleeding from gums and\\nother bleeding tendencies.\\n3.Infections  are quite common and include those of mouth,\\nthroat, skin, respiratory, perianal and other sites.\\n4.Fever  is generally attributed to infections in acute leukae-\\nmia but sometimes no obvious source of infection can be\\nfound and may occur in the absence of infection.\\nII. DUE TO ORGAN INFILTRATION.  The clinical\\nmanifestations of AML are more often due to replacement\\nof the marrow and other tissues by leukaemic cells. Thesefeatures are as under:\\n1.Pain and tenderness of bones  (e.g. sternal tenderness) are\\ndue to bone infarcts or subperiosteal infiltrates by leukaemic\\ncells.\\n2.Lymphadenopathy  and enlargement of the tonsils  may\\noccur.3.Splenomegaly  of moderate grade may occur. Splenic\\ninfarction, subcapsular haemorrhages, and rarely, splenic\\nrupture may occur.\\n4.Hepatomegaly  is frequently present due to leukaemic\\ninfiltration but the infiltrates usually do not interfere with\\nthe function of the liver.\\n5.Leukaemic infiltration of the kidney  may be present and\\nordinarily does not interfere with its function unless\\nsecondary complications such as haemorrhage or blockageof ureter supervene.\\n6.Gum hypertrophy due to leukaemic infiltration of the\\ngingivae is a frequent finding in myelomonocytic (M4) and\\nmonocytic (M5) leukaemias.7.Chloroma or granulocytic sarcoma  is a localised tumour-\\nforming mass occurring in the skin or orbit due to localinfiltration of the tissues by leukaemic cells. The tumour isgreenish in appearance due to the presence ofmyeloperoxidase.\\n8.Meningeal involvement  manifested by raised intracranial\\npressure, headache, nausea and vomiting, blurring of vision\\nand diplopia are seen more frequently in ALL duringhaematologic remission. Sudden death from massiveintracranial haemorrhage as a result of leucostasis may occur.\\n9.Other organ infiltrations  include testicular swelling and\\nmediastinal compression.\\nLaboratory Findings\\nThe diagnosis of AML is made by a combination of routine\\nblood picture and bone marrow examination, coupledwith cytochemical stains and other special laboratoryinvestigations.\\nI. BLOOD PICTURE.  Findings of routine haematologic\\ninvestigations are as under (Fig. 14.14):\\n1. Anaemia.  Anaemia is almost always present in AML.\\nIt is generally severe, progressive and normochromic. A\\nmoderate reticulocytosis up to 5% and a few nucleatedred cells may be present.\\n2. Thrombocytopenia.  The platelet count is usually mode-\\nrately to severely reduced (below 50,000/ μl) but\\noccasionally it may be normal. Bleeding tendencies in\\nAML are usually correlated with the level ofthrombocytopenia but most serious spontaneoushaemorrhagic episodes develop in patients with fewerthan 20,000/ μl platelets. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia\\n(M3) may be associated with a serious coagulationabnormality, disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC).\\n3. White blood cells.  The total WBC count ranges from\\nsubnormal-to-markedly elevated values. In 25% of\\npatients, the total WBC count at presentation is reducedto 1,000-4,000 / μl. More often, however, there is progres-\\nsive rise in white cell count which may exceed 100,000/ μl\\nin more advanced disease. Majority of leucocytes in theperipheral blood are blasts and there is often neutropeniadue to marrow infiltration by leukaemic cells. The basicmorphologic features of myeloblasts and lymphoblasts aresummed up in Table 14.1. Typical characteristics ofdifferent forms of AML (M0 to M7) are given in Table14.5. In some instances, the identification of blast cells is\\ngreatly aided by the company they keep  i.e. by more mature\\nand easily identifiable leucocytes in the company of blasticcells of myeloid series. Some ‘smear cells’  in the peripheral\\nblood representing degenerated leucocytes may be seen.\\nII. BONE MARROW EXAMINATION.  An examination\\nof bone marrow aspirate or trephine reveals the following\\nfeatures:\\n1. Cellularity.  Typically, the marrow is hypercellular but\\nsometimes a ‘blood tap’ or ‘dry tap’ occurs. A dry tap in\\nAML may be due to pancytopenia, but sometimes even364SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues when the marrow is so much filled with leukaemic cells\\nthat they cannot be aspirated because the cells are adhesive\\nand enmeshed in reticulin fibres. In such cases, trephinebiopsy should be done.\\n2. Leukaemic cells.  The bone marrow is generally tightly\\npacked with leukaemic blast cells. The diagnosis of the\\ntype of leukaemic cells, according to FAB classification, isgenerally possible with routine Romanowsky stains butcytochemical stains may be employed as an adjunct toRomanowsky staining for determining the type of\\nleukaemia. The essential criteria for diagnosis of AML, as\\nper FAB classification, was the presence of at least 30%blasts in the bone marrow. However, as per WHOclassification, these criteria have been revised and loweredto 20% blasts in the marrow for labelling and treating acase as AML.\\n3. Erythropoiesis.  Erythropoietic cells are reduced.\\nDyserythropoiesis, megaloblastic features and ring\\nsideroblasts are commonly present.\\n4. Megakaryocytes.  They are usually reduced or absent.\\n5. Cytogenetics.  Chromosomal analysis of dividing leuka-\\nemic cells in the marrow shows karyotypic abnormalities\\nin 75% of cases which may have a relationship to\\nprognosis. WHO classification emphasises on thecategorisation of AML on the basis of cytogeneticabnormalities. Two of the most consistent cytogeneticabnormalities in specific FAB groups are as under:\\ni)M3 cases have t(15;17)(q22;q12).\\nii) M4E0 (E for abnormal eosinophils in the bone marrow)\\ncases have inv(16)(p13q22).\\n6. Immunophenotyping.  AML cells express CD13 and\\nCD33 antigens. M7 shows CD41 and CD42 positivity.\\nIII. CYTOCHEMISTRY.  Some of the commonly emplo-\\nyed cytochemical stains, as an aid to classify the type of\\nAML are as under (also see Table 14.5):\\n1. Myeloperoxidase:  Positive in immature myeloid cells\\ncontaining granules and Auer rods but negative in M0\\nmyeloblasts.2. Sudan Black:  Positive in immature cells in AML.\\n3. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS):  Positive in immature\\nlymphoid cells and in erythroleukaemia (M6).\\n4. Non-specific esterase (NSE):  Positive in monocytic\\nseries (M4 and M5).5. Acid phosphatase:  Focal positivity in leukaemic blasts\\nin ALL and diffuse reaction in monocytic cells (M4 and\\nM5).\\nIV. BIOCHEMICAL  INVESTIGATIONS.  These may be\\nof some help:\\n1.  Serum muramidase.  Serum levels of lysozyme (i.e.\\nmuramidase) are elevated in myelomonocytic (M4) and\\nmonocytic (M5) leukaemias.\\n2. Serum uric acid.  Because of rapidly growing number\\nof leukaemic cells, serum uric acid level is frequently\\nincreased. The levels are further raised after treatmentwith cytotoxic drugs because of increased cell breakdown.\\nTreatment and Complications\\nThe management of acute leukaemia involves the following\\naspects:\\nI. TREATMENT OF ANAEMIA AND HAEMORRHAGE.\\nAnaemia and haemorrhage are managed by fresh bloodtransfusions and platelet concentrates. Patients with severethrombocytopenia (platelet count below 20,000/ μl) require\\nregular platelet transfusions since haemorrhage is animportant cause of death in these cases.\\nII. TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF INFECTION.\\nNeutropenia due to bone marrow replacement by leukaemicblasts and as a result of intensive cytotoxic therapy rendersthese patients highly susceptible to infection. The infectionsare predominantly bacterial but viral, fungal, and protozoalinfections also occur. For prophylaxis against infection insuch cases, the patient should be isolated and preferablyplaced in laminar airflow rooms. Efforts are made to reducethe gut and other commensal flora which are the usual sourceFigure 14.14 PBF findings in a case of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML).\\n365CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuesof infection. This is achieved by bowel sterilisation and by\\ntopical antiseptics. If these fail to achieve the desired results,systemic antibiotics and leucocyte concentrates areconsidered for therapy.\\nIII.CYTOTOXIC DRUG THERAPY.  The aims of cytotoxic\\ntherapy are firstly to induce remission, secondly to continue\\ntherapy to reduce the hidden leukaemic cell population byrepeated courses of therapy. Most commonly, cycliccombinations of 2, 3 and 4 drugs are given with treatment-free intervals to allow the bone marrow to recover.\\nThe most effective treatment of AML is a combination of\\n3 drugs: cytosine arabinoside, anthracyclines (daunorubicin,adriamycin) and 6-thioguanine. Another addition isamsacrine (m-AMSA) administered with cytosinearabinoside, with or without 6-thioguanine. Followingremission-induction therapy, various drug combinations aregiven intermittently for maintenance. However,promyelocytic leukaemia (M3) is treated with tretinoin orallythat reduces the leukaemic cells bearing  t(15;17)(q22;q21)but devlopment of DIC due to liberation of granules  of dyingcells is a problem.\\nIV.BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION.  Bone\\nmarrow (or stem cell) transplantation from suitable allogenic\\nor autologous donor (HLA and mixed lymphocytes culture-matched) is increasingly being used for treating young adultswith AML in first remission. The basic principle of marrowtransplantation is to reconstitute the patient’s haematopoieticsystem after total body irradiation and intensivechemotherapy have been given so as to kill the remainingleukaemic cells. Bone marrow transplantation has resultedin cure in about half the cases.\\nRemission rate with AML is lower (50-70%) than in ALL,\\noften takes longer to achieve remission, and disease-freeintervals are shorter. AML is most malignant of allleukaemias; median survival with treatment is 12-18 months.\\nLYMPHOID NEOPLASMS\\nLymphoid cells constitute the immune system of the body.These cells circulate in the blood and also lie in the lymphoidtissues and undergo differentiation and maturation in theseorgans. The haematopoietic stem cells which form myeloidand lymphoid series, undergo further differentiation oflymphoid cells into B cells (including formation of plasmacells), T cells and NK cells. Lymphoid malignancies can beformed by malignant transformation of each of these celllines. These lymphoid malignancies can range from indolentto highly aggressive human cancers.\\nConventionally, malignancies of lymphoid cells in blood\\nhave been termed as lymphatic leukaemias and those oflymphoid tissues as lymphomas. Just like myeloidleukaemias discussed earlier, lymphoid leukaemias havebeen classified on the basis of survival and biologic course,into chronic and acute (CLL and ALL) . Similarly, two\\nclinicopathologically distinct groups of lymphomas aredistinguished: Hodgkin’s lymphoma  or Hodgkin’s disease (HD)\\nand non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) .However, while HD can be identified by the patho-\\ngnomonic presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, there have beencontroversies and confusion in classification of otherlymphoid cancers (i.e. NHL and lymphoid leukaemias). Inorder to resolve the issue, over the years several classificationschemes have emerged for lymphoid cancers due tofollowing two main reasons:\\n1. Biologic course of lymphoma-leukaemia.  While some\\nof the lymphoid malignancies initially present as leukaemias\\n(i.e. in the blood and bone marrow), many others present assolid masses in the lymphoid tissues or in various othertissues, especilly in the spleen, liver, bone marrow and othertissues. Still others may have initial presentation as eitherleukaemia or lymphomas. In fact, the line of demarcationfor lymphoid malignancies is so blurred that during thebiologic course of the disease, lymphoid leukaemia orlymphoma may spill over and transform to the other.\\n2. Technological advances.  In recent times, modern\\ndiagnostic tools have become available to pathologists and\\nhaematologists which go much beyond making the diagnosisof lymphomas and leukaemias on clinical grounds combinedwith morphology and cytochemical stains alone. Thisincludes methods for immunophenotyping, cytogenetics andmolecular markers for the stage of differentiation of the cellof origin rather than location of the cell alone.\\nThese aspects form the basis of current concept for WHO\\nclassification of malignancies of lymphoid cells of blood andlymphoreticular tissues as ‘lymphoid neoplasms’ as a unifiedgroup. However, it needs to be appreciated that in severalcentres in developing countries of the world, limitedlaboratory facilities are available. Thus, judiciously speaking,some of the older classification schemes for lymphoidmalignancies need to be retained, while others can bedumped as historical. In view of this, a balancedapproach of middle path of retaining old and including newclassification schemes of lymphoid malignancies isproposed to be followed for discussion below:\\nI. HISTORICAL CLASSIFICATIONS. These classifica-\\ntions can be traced as under:\\nMorphologic classification. Rappaport classification (1966)\\nproposed a clinically relevant morphologic classification\\nbased on two main features:  low-power microscopy  of the\\noverall pattern of the lymph node architecture, and high-power\\nmicroscopy  revealing the cytology of the neoplastic cells.\\nBased on these two features, Rappaport divided NHL intotwo major subtypes:\\n1.Nodular or follicular lymphomas  which retain some of the\\nfeatures of normal lymph node in that the neoplastic cells\\nform lymphoid ‘nodules’ rather than lymphoid follicles withgerminal centres.\\n2.Diffuse lymphomas,  on the other hand, are characterised\\nby effacement of the normal lymph node architecture and\\nthere may be infiltration of neoplastic cells outside thecapsule of the involved lymph node.\\nNHL was further classified according to the degree of\\ndifferentiation of neoplastic cells into: well-differentiated,366SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\npoorly-differentiated,  and histiocytic (large cells) types  of both\\nnodular and diffuse lymphomas.\\nImmunologic classifications. Lukes-Collins classification\\n(1974)  was proposed to correlate the type of NHL with the\\nimmune system because the identification of T and B-cells\\nand their subpopulations had become possible in early 70s.Its subsequent modification was Kiel classification (1981).  Both\\nthese classifications employed immunologic markers fortumour cells, and divided all malignant lymphomas intoeither B-cell or T-cell origin, and rarely of macrophages. TheB and T-cell tumours were further subdivided on the basisof their light microscopic characteristics. The majority of NHLwere B lymphocyte derivatives and arise from follicularcentre cells (FCC). The FCC in the germinal centre undergotransformation to become large immunoblasts and passthrough the four stages—s mall cleaved cells  and large cleaved\\ncells, small non-cleaved cells and large non-cleaved cells.\\nThough these classification schemes were immuno-\\nlogically correct, they were unclear about varying prognosisof different clinical types of NHL of either B-cell or T-cellorigin.\\nII. OLD CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATIONS. In\\nview of the objections to above pure morphologic and\\nimmunologically correct classifications, following twoclinically relevant classifications were proposed which cannotbe readily abandoned:\\nFAB classification of lymphoid leukaemia.  Although old,\\nFAB classification for lymphoid leukaemia was initially\\nbased on morphology and cytochemistry into 3 types of ALL(L1 to L3), but was subsequently revised to includecytogenetic and immunologic features as well  (Table 14.6) .\\nFAB classification is still followed in many centres whereboth pathologists and clinicians  stick to labelling lymphoidleukaemia separate from lymphomas.\\nWorking Formulations for Clinical Usage (1982).  This\\nclassification proposed by a panel of experts from National\\nCancer Institute of the US incorporates the best features ofall previous classification systems, and as the name implies,has strong clinical relevance. Based on the natural history ofdisease and long-term survival studies, Working Formula-tions divides all NHLs into following 3 prognostic groups:\\nLow-grade NHL:  5-year survival 50-70%\\nIntermediate-grade NHL:  5-year survival 35-45%\\nHigh-grade NHL:  5-year survival 25-35%.\\nIn this classification, no attempt is made to determine\\nwhether the tumour cells have origin from B-cells, T-cells ormacrophages. Each prognostic group includes a fewmorphologic subtypes, and lastly, a miscellaneous group isalso described.\\nWorking Formulations still has many takers in several\\ncentres and is retained in Table 14.7.\\nREAL classification (1994).  International Lymphoma Study\\nGroup (Harris et al) proposed another classification called\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 14.6: FAB Classification of ALL.\\nA.

Histiocytic (Histiocytic medullary reticulosis)367CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nrevised European- American classification of lymphoid\\nneoplasms abbreviated as REAL classification. This\\nclassification was based on the hypothesis that all forms oflymphoid malignancies (NHLs as well as lymphoblasticleukaemias) represent malignant counterparts of normalpopulation of immune cells (B-cells, T-cells and histiocytes)present in the lymph node and bone marrow. It is believedthat lymphoid malignancies arise due to arrest at the variousdifferentiation stages of B and T-cells since tumours of histio-cytic origin are quite uncommon. Accordingly, it isconsidered essential to understand and correlate thedifferentiation stages of B and T-cells with various lymphoidmalignancies  (Fig. 14.15).  REAL classification divides all\\nlymphoid malignancies into two broad groups, each havingfurther subtypes:\\nLeukaemias and lymphomas of B-cell origin:  B-cell derivation\\ncomprises 80% cases of lymphoid leukaemias and 90% casesof NHLs. Based upon these phenotypic and genotypicfeatures, B-cell neoplasms are of pre-B and mature B-cellorigin. Based on their biologic behaviour, B-cell malignanciesare further subclassified into indolent and aggressive. Allthese tumours express Pan-B (CD19) antigen besides othermarkers.Leukaemias and lymphomas of T-cell origin:  T-cell\\nmalignancies comprise the remainder 20% cases of lymphoidleukaemia and 10% cases of NHLs. T-cell malignancies reflectthe stages of T-cell ontogeny. Like B-cell malignancies, T-cell derivatives too are further categorised into indolent andaggressive T-cell malignancies. The most widely expressedT-cell antigens are CD2 and CD7.\\nREAL classification subsequently merged into WHO\\nclassification described below.\\nIII. WHO CLASSIFICATION OF LYMPHOID NEO-\\nPLASMS (1999):   In view of confusion surrounding the\\nclassification schemes of lymphoid cancer, Harris et al, whodescribed REAL classification, evolved a consensusinternational classification of all lymphoid neoplasms togetheras a unified group (lymphoid leukaemias-lymphomas) underthe aegis of the WHO. Although this classification has manysimilarities with REAL classification as regards identification\\nof B and T cell types (Fig. 14.15),  WHO classification has more\\nclasses. WHO classification takes into account morphology,clinical features, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetic of thetumour cells. Hence, on this basis, it is possible to know thestage of maturity of the neoplastic cell and thus has a betterclinical and therapeutic relevance.Figure 14.15 Schematic representation of WHO-REAL classification of lymphoid neoplasms. Various immunophenotypes of B and T-cell\\nmalignancies are correlated with normal immunophenotypic differentiation/maturation stages of B and T-cells in the bone marrow,  lymphoid tissue,\\nperipheral blood and thymus.\\n368SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nAs per WHO classification scheme (Table 14.8) , all\\nlymphoid neoplasms (i.e. lymphoid leukaemias and\\nlymphomas) fall into following 5 categories:I. Hodgkin’s disease\\nI\\nI. Precursor (Immature) B-cell malignancies\\nIII.Peripheral (Mature) B-cell malignancies\\nIV. Precursor (Immature) T-cell malignanciesV. Peripheral (Mature) T-cell and NK–cell malignancies\\nThus, in the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms,\\nHodgkin’s disease stands distinctive; remaining fourcategories listed above fall into 2 groups:\\n1) Precursor or immature lymphoid malignancies of B or T\\ncell origin, meaning blastic type of leukaemias-lymphomas(mainly B or T-cell ALL); and\\n2) Peripheral or mature malignancies of B or T cell origin\\n(meaning CLL and other lymphomas).\\nGENERAL COMMENTS ON LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES\\nBefore plunging into discussion of various common examples\\nin the WHO classification system, a few general aspects onlymphoid neoplasms need to be understood:\\n1. Overall frequency:  Five major forms of lymphoid\\nmalignancies and their relative frequency are as under:\\ni)NHL=  62%, \\nmost common lymphoma\\nii) HD=  8%iii) Plasma cell disorders = 15%\\niv) CLL= 9%, most common lymphoid leukaemia\\nv) ALL= 4%Relative frequency of subtypes within various NHLs listed\\nin Table 14.8 is as under:i) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma = 31%ii) Follicular lymphoma = 22%iii) MALT lymphoma = 8%\\niv) Mature T cell lymphoma = 8%v) Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) = 7%vi) Mantle cell lymphoma = 6%vii) Mediastinal large B cell lymphoma = 2.5%\\nviii) Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) = 2.5%ix) Burkitt’s lymphoma = 2.5%x) Others = ~10%\\n2. Incidence of B, T, NK cell malignancies:  Majority of\\nlymphoid malignancies are of B cell origin (75% of lymphoid\\nleukaemias and 90% of lymphomas) while remaining are Tcell malignancies; NK-cell lymphomas-leukaemias are rare.\\n3. Diagnosis:  The diagnosis of lymphoma (both Hodgkin’s\\nand non-Hodgkin’s) can only be reliably made on exami-\\nnation of lymph node biopsy. While the initial diagnosis ofALL and CLL can be made on CBC examination, bonemarrow biopsy is done for genetic and immunologic studies.Subsequently, clinical chemistry, electrophoresis and testsfor organ involvement including CSF examination if CNSinvolvement is suspected, need to be carried out.\\n4. Staging:   In both HD and NHL, Ann Arbor staging is done\\nfor proper evaluation and planning treatment.\\n5. Ancillary studies:  CT scan, PET scan and gallium scan\\nare additional imaging modalities which can be used in\\nstaging HD and NHL cases.\\uf075\\uf075\\nHodgkin’s Disease\\nNodular lymphocytic predominant HD\\nClassic HD\\n1.

Immune abnormalities:  Since lymphoid neoplasms arise\\nfrom immune cells of the body, immune derangements\\npertaining to the cell of origin may accompany these cancers.\\nThis is particularly so in B-cell malignancies and includeoccurrence of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, autoimmunethrombocytopenia and hypogammaglobulinaemia.\\nWith this background, we now turn to discussion of some\\ncommon and important examples of lymphoid malignancies.\\nHODGKIN’S DISEASE\\nHodgkin’s disease (HD) primarily arises within the lymph\\nnodes and involves the extranodal sites secondarily. Thisgroup comprises about 8% of all cases of lymphoid\\nneoplasms. The incidence of the disease has bimodal peaks—\\none in young adults between the age of 15 and 35 years andthe other peak after 5th decade of life. The HD is moreprevalent in young adult males than females. The classical\\ndiagnostic feature is the presence of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cell\\n(or Dorothy-Reed-Sternberg cell)  (described later).\\nClassification\\nThe diagnosis of HD requires accurate microscopic diagnosis\\nby biopsy, usually from lymph node, and occasionally fromother tissues. Unlike NHL, there is only one universallyaccepted classification of HD i.e. Rye classification  adopted\\nsince 1966. Rye classification divides HD into the following4 subtypes:1.\\nLymphocyte-predominance type\\n2. Nodular-sclerosis type3.Mixed-cellularity type\\n4.\\nLymphocyte-depletion type.\\nHowever, the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms\\ndivides HD into 2 main groups:I. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant HD (a new type).II. Classic HD (includes all the 4 above subtypes in the Ryeclassification).\\nCentral to the diagnosis of HD is the essential\\nidentification of Reed-Sternberg  cell  though this is not the sole\\ncriteria (see below).The salient features of the 4 histologic subtypes of HD\\nare summarised in Table 14.9.\\nReed-S ternberg Cell\\nThe diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease rests on identification ofRS cells, though uncommonly similar cells can occur ininfectious mononucleosis and other forms of lymphomas.Therefore, additional cellular and architectural features ofthe biopsy must be given due consideration for making thehistologic diagnosis.\\nThere are several morphologic variants of RS cells which\\ncharacterise different histologic subtypes of HD (Fig. 14.16):\\n1. Classic RS cell  is a large cell which has characteristically\\na bilobed nucleus appearing as mirror image of each otherbut occasionally the nucleus may be multilobed. Each lobeof the nucleus contains a prominent, eosinophilic, inclusion-like nucleolus with a clear halo around it, giving an owl-eyeappearance. The cytoplasm of cell is abundant andamphophilic.\\n2.Lacunar type RS cell  is smaller and in addition to above\\nfeatures has a pericellular space or lacuna in which it lies,\\nwhich is due to artefactual shrinkage of the cell cytoplasm.It is characteristically found in nodular sclerosis variety ofHD.\\n3. Polyploid type (or popcorn or lymphocytic-histiocytic\\ni.e. L and H) RS cells  are seen in lymphocyte predominance\\ntype of HD. This type of RS cell is larger with lobulatednucleus in the shape of popcorn.\\n4.\\nPleomorphic RS cells  are a feature of lymphocyte\\ndepletion type. These cells have pleomorphic and atypical\\nnuclei.\\nThe nature and origin of RS cells, which are the real neo-\\nplastic cells in HD, have been a matter of considerable debate.One main reason for this difficulty in their characterisationis that in HD, unlike most other malignancies, the numberof neoplastic cells (i.e. RS cells) is very small (less than 5%)which are interspersed in the predominant reactive cells.  Ingeneral, the number of RS cells is inversely proportional to\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 14.9: Modified WHO Classification of Hodgkin’s Disease.\\nHistologic Subtype Incidence Main Pathology RS Cells Prognosis\\nI.

RS cells in alltypes of Hodgkin’s diseases, except in lymphocyte predomi-nance type, express immunoreactivity for CD15 and CD30(Fig. 14.17) . RS cells in lymphocyte predominance type,\\nhowever, are negative for both CD15 and CD30, but positivefor CD20.\\nRS cells are invariably accompanied by variable number\\nof atypical Hodgkin cells  which are believed to be precursor\\nRS cells but are not considered diagnostic of HD. Hodgkincells are large mononuclear cells (rather than mirror imagenuclei) having nuclear and cytoplasmic similarity to that ofRS cell.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the gross\\nappearance of Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomais much the same. Any lymph node group may beinvolved but most commonly affected are the cervical,supraclavicular and axillary groups. Initially, the lymphnodes are discrete and separate from one another but laterthe lymph nodes form a large matted mass due toinfiltration into the surrounding connective tissue.Extranodal involvements produce either a discrete tumouror diffuse enlargement of the affected organ. The sectionedsurface of the involved lymph nodes or extranodal organinvolved appears grey-white and fishflesh-like. Nodular\\nsclerosis type HD may show formation of nodules due to\\nscarring while mixed cellularity  and lymphocyte depletion\\ntypes  HD may show abundance of necrosis .

CLASSIC HD\\nAs per WHO classification, classic group of HD includes\\n4 types of HD of older Rye classification:\\n1. Lymphocyte-predominance type  (Fig. 14.16,A). The\\nlymphocyte-predominance type of HD is characterised by\\nproliferation of small lymphocytes admixed with avarying number of histiocytes forming nodular or diffusepattern.i)Nodular form  is characterised by replacement of nodal\\narchitecture by numerous large neoplastic nodules.ii)Diffuse form  does not have discernible nodules but\\ninstead there is diffuse proliferation of cells.\\nHowever, currently nodular form of lymphocyte\\npredominent HD has been categorised separately due toits distinct immunophenotyping features and prognosis(discussed below).\\nFor making the diagnosis, definite demonstration of\\nRS cells is essential which are few in number, requiring athorough search. In addition to typical RS cells, polyploid\\nvariant having polyploid, and twisted nucleus (popcorn-\\nlike) may be found in some cases. This type of HD usuallydoes not show other cells like plasma cells, eosinophilsand neutrophils, nor are necrosis or fibrosis seen.\\n2.Nodular-sclerosis type  (Fig. 14.16,B) . Nodular sclero-\\nsis is the most frequent type of HD, seen more commonly\\nin women than in men. It is characterised by two essentialfeatures  (Fig. 14.18, A):\\ni)Bands of collagen:  Variable amount of fibrous tissue is\\ncharacteristically present in the involved lymph nodes.Occasionally, the entire lymph node may be replaced bydense hyalinised collagen.ii)Lacunar type RS cells:  Characteristic lacunar type of RS\\ncells with distinctive pericellular halo are present. Thesecells appear lacunar due to the shrinkage of cytoplasm informalin-fixed tissue. The pericellular halo is not seen ifthe tissue is fixed in Zenker’s fluid.\\nIn addition to these 2 characteristics, the nodules\\nbetween the fibrous septa consist predominantly oflymphocytes and macrophages, sometimes with foci ofnecrosis.\\n3.Mixed-cellularity type (Fig. 14.16,C).  This form of HD\\ngenerally replaces the entire affected lymph nodes by\\nheterogeneous mixture of various types of apparentlynormal cells. These include proliferating lymphocytes,histiocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and plasma cells.Some amount of fibrosis and focal areas of necrosis aregenerally present. Typical RS cells are frequent  (Fig. 14.18,\\nB).\\n4\\n. Lymphocyte-depletion type  (Fig. 14.16,D).  In this type\\nof HD, the lymph node is depleted of lymphocytes. There\\nare two variants of lymphocyte-depletion HD:i)Diffuse fibrotic variant  is hypocellular and the entire\\nlymph node is replaced by diffuse fibrosis, appearing ashomogeneous, fibrillar hyaline material. The area ofhyalinosis contains some lymphocytes, atypical histiocytes(Hodgkin cells), and numerous typical and atypical(pleomorphic) RS cells.ii)Reticular variant  is much more cellular and consists of\\nlarge number of atypical pleomorphic histiocytes, scantylymphocytes and a few typical RS cells.\\nII.NODULAR LYMPHOCYTE-PREDOMINANT HD\\nThis is a newly described entity which is distinct from the\\nclassic HD described above. This type was previouslyincluded in lymphocyte predominant type of HD. Itspeculiarities are as under:\\ni)  These cases of HD have a nodular growth pattern\\n(similar to nodular sclerosis type).ii) Like lymphocyte-predominant pattern of classic type,there is predominance of small lymphocytes with  sparsenumber of RS cells.iii) These cases of HD have distinctive immuno-phenotyping—CD45 positive, epithelial membraneantigen (EMA) positive but negative for the usual markersfor RS cells (CD15 and CD30 negative).iv) Though generally it has a chronic relapsing course,but some cases of this type of HD may transform into largeB-cell NHL.\\nClinical Features\\nHodgkin’s disease is particularly frequent among young and\\nmiddle-aged adults. All histologic subtypes of HD, exceptthe nodular sclerosis variety, are more common in males.The disease usually begins with superficial lymph nodeenlargement and subsequently spreads to other lymphoidand non-lymphoid structures.\\n1.Most commonly, patients present with painless, movable\\nand firm \\nlymphadenopathy.  The cervical and mediastinal\\nFigure 14.17 RS cells showing positive immunostaining for  CD15,\\na B-cell marker.372SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nlymph nodes are involved most frequently. Other lymph\\nnode groups like axillary, inguinal and abdominal areinvolved sometimes.\\n2. Approximately half the patients develop splenomegaly\\nduring the course of the disease. Liver enlargement  too may\\noccur.3.Constitutional symptoms  (type B symptoms) are present\\nin 25-40% of patients. The most common is low-grade fever\\nwith night sweats and weight loss. Other symptoms includefatigue, malaise, weakness and pruritus.\\nOther Laboratory Findings\\nBesides clinical and pathologic findings, there are some\\nhaematologic and immunologic abnormalities in HD.\\nHaematologic abnormalities:\\n1.A moderate, normocytic and normochromic anaemia  is\\noften present.\\n2.Serum iron and TIBC  are low but marrow iron stores are\\nnormal or increased.3.Marrow infiltration  by the disease may produce marrow\\nfailure with leucoerythroblastic reaction.4.Routine blood counts  reveal moderate leukaemoid reaction.\\nCases with pruritus frequently show peripheral eosinophilia.Advanced disease is associated with absolute lymphopenia.5Platelet count  is normal or increased.\\n6.ESR is invariably elevated.\\nImmunologic abnormalities:\\n1. There is progressive fall in immunocompetent T-cells\\nwith  defective cellular immunity.  There is reversal of CD4: CD8\\nratio and anergy to routine skin tests.2.Humoral antibody production  is normal in untreated\\npatients until late in the disease.\\nStaging\\nFollowing biopsy and histopathologic classification of HD,\\nthe extent of involvement of the disease (i.e. staging) isstudied in order to select proper treatment and assess theprognosis. Ann Arbor staging classification  takes into account\\nboth clinical and pathologic stage of the disease.\\nThe suffix A or B are added to the above stages depen-\\nding upon whether the three constitutional symptoms (fever,night sweats and unexplained weight loss exceeding 10% ofnormal) are absent (A) or present (B). The suffix E or S\\n are\\nused for extranodal involvement and splenomegalyrespectively  (Table 14.10).\\nFor complete staging, a number of other essential diag-\\nnostic studies  are recommended. These are as under:\\n1.Detailed physical examination including sites of nodal\\ninvolvement and splenomegaly.2. Chest radiograph to exclude mediastinal, pleural andlung parenchymal involvement.3. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis.\\n\\uf075\\uf075TABLE 14.10: Ann Arbor Staging Classification of Hodgkin’s\\nDisease.\\nStage I I Involvement of a single lymph node region.\\n(A or B) IE Involvement of a single extra-lymphatic organ\\nor site.\\nStage II II Involvement of two or more lymph node\\n(A or B) regions on the same side of the diaphragm.\\nIIE (or) with localised contiguous involvement of anextranodal organ or site.\\nStage III  III Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides\\n(A or B) of the diaphragm.\\nIII\\nE (or) with localised contiguous involvement of anextranodal organ or site.\\nIII\\nS (or) with involvement of spleen.\\nIllES (or) both features of IIIE and IIIS.\\nStage IV IV Multiple or disseminated involvement of one\\n(A or B) or\\nmore extra-lymphatic organs or tissues with orwithout lymphatic involvement.\\n(A = Asymptomatic; B = Presence of constitutional symptoms;E = Extranodal involvement; S = Splenomegaly).Figure 14.18\\nHodgkin’s disease.

Finally, histopathologic documentation of the type ofHodgkin’s disease.\\nMore invasive investigations include lymphangiography\\nof lower extremities  and staging laparotomy.  Staging laparotomy\\nincludes biopsy of selected lymph nodes in theretroperitoneum, splenectomy and wedge biopsy of the liver.\\nPrognosis\\nWith use of aggressive radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the\\noutlook for Hodgkin’s disease has improved significantly.Although several factors affect the prognosis, two importantconsiderations in evaluating its outcome are the  extent of\\ninvolvement by the disease (i.e. staging)  and the histologic subtype.\\nWith appropriate treatment, the overall 5 years survival\\nrate for stage I and II A is as high as about 100%, while the\\nadvanced stage of the disease may have upto 50% 5-yearsurvival rate.\\nPatients with lymphocyte-predominance type  of HD tend to\\nhave localised form of the disease and have excellentprognosis.\\nNodular sclerosis  variety too has very good prognosis but\\nthose patients with larger mediastinal mass respond poorlyto both chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\\nMixed cellularity type  occupies intermediate clinical\\nposition between the lymphocyte predominance and thelymphocyte-depletion type, but patients with disseminateddisease and systemic manifestations do poorly.\\nLymphocyte-depletion type  is usually disseminated at the\\ntime of diagnosis and is associated with constitutionalsymptoms. These patients usually have the most aggressiveform of the disease.\\nThe salient features to distinguish Hodgkin’s disease\\nand non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are summarised inTable 14.11.\\nPRECURSOR (IMMA TURE) B- AND\\nT\\n-CELL LEUKAEMIA/LYMPHOMA\\n(SYNONYM: ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKAEMIA)\\nLymphoid malignancy originating from precursor series of\\nB or T cell (i.e. pre-B and pre-T) is the most common form ofcancer of children under 4 years of age, together constituting4% of all lymphoid malignancies. Pre-B cell ALL constitutes90% cases while pre-T cell lymphoid malignancies comprisethe remaining 10%. This group of lymphoid malignanciesarise from more primitive stages of B or T cells but the stageof differentiation is not related to aggressiveness. Because ofmorphologic similarities, both these are presented together.\\nClinical Features\\nPRECURSOR B-CELL LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKAEMIA/\\nLYMPHOMA.  Most often, it presents as ALL in children;\\nrarely presentation may be in the form of lymphoma inchildren or adults and it rapidly transforms into leukaemia.In cases having leukaemic presentation, extranodal siteinvolvement is early such as lymphadenopathy accompaniedwith hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, CNS infiltration,testicular enlargement, and at times cutaneous infiltration.Infections due to cytopenia are present.\\nPRECURSOR T-CELL LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKAEMIA/\\nLYMPHOMA.  As the name implies, these cases may present\\nas ALL or as lymphoma. Since the precursor T-cellsdifferentiate in the thymus, this tumour often presents asmediastinal mass and pleural effusion and progresses rapidlyto develop leukaemia in the blood and bone marrow.Clinically, features of bone marrow failure are present whichinclude anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and CNSinvolvement are frequent.\\nPrecursor T-cell lymphoma-leukaemia is, however, more\\naggressive than its B-cell counterpart.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES\\nPrecursor B and T-cell ALL/lymphoma are indistinguish-\\nable on routine morphology. The diagnosis is made byfollowing investigations:\\n1.Blood examination.  Peripheral blood generally shows\\nanaemia and thrombocytopenia, and may show\\nleucopenia-to-normal TLC-to-leucocytosis. DLC showslarge number of circulating lymphoblasts  having roundto convoluted nuclei, high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio andabsence of cytoplasmic granularity. It is important todistinguish AML from ALL; the morphologic features ofmyeloblasts and lymphoblasts are contrasted in Table 14.1for comparison (Fig. 14.19).  Typical characteristics of\\ndifferent forms of ALL (L1 to L3) are given in Table 14.6.\\nIt is usual to find some ‘smear cells’  in the peripheral blood\\nwhich represent degenerated leucocytes.\\uf075\\uf075TABLE 14.11: Contrasting Features of Hodgkin’s Disease\\nand Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.\\nFeature Hodgkin’s Non-Hodgkin’s\\n1.

Cytochemical stains may be employed\\nas an adjunct to Romanowsky staining for determining\\nthe type of leukaemia. Some of the commonly employedcytochemical stains in characterisation of leukaemic blastsin ALL are as under:\\ni) Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS):  Positive in immature lymphoid\\ncells in ALL.\\nii) Acid phosphatase:  Focal positivity in leukaemic blasts in\\nALL.\\niii) Myeloperoxidase:  Negative in immature cells in ALL.\\niv) Sudan Black:  Negative in immature cells in ALL.\\nv) Non-specific esterase (NSE):  Negative in ALL.\\nImmunophenotyping.  TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl\\ntransferase) is expressed by the nuclei of both pre-B and\\npre-T stages of differentiation of lymphoid cells.  Specificdiagnosis is eastablished by following immunopheno-typing:\\nPre-B-cell type : Typically positive for pan-B cell markers\\nCD19, CD10, CD9a.\\nPre-T-cell type : Typically positive for CD1, CD2, CD3, CD5,\\nCD7.\\nCytogenetic analysis:  Leukaemic blasts in pre-B-cell ALL\\nshow characteristic cytogenetic abnormality of t(9;22) i.e.\\nPhiladelphia positive-ALL.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment plan for children with pre-B or pre-T cell ALL is\\nintensive remission induction with combination therapy.Patients presenting with pre-B or pre-T cell lymphoma aretreated as a case of ALL.CHEMOTHERAPY.  The most useful drugs in the treatment\\nof ALL are combination of vincristine, prednisolone,anthracyclines (daunorubicin, adriamycin) and L-aspara-\\nginase. Other agents used are cytosine arabinoside a nd\\nmethotrexate. Though 90% of children with ALL showremission with this therapy, patients with T cell ALL andthose with meningeal involvement carry a less favourableprognosis. CNS involvement is beyond the reach of mostof the cytotoxic drugs used in the therapy of ALL. CNSprophylaxis in such cases is considered after the initialremission has been obtained and includes cranial irradiationand course of intrathecal methotrexate or cytosinearabinoside.\\nBONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION.  Bone marrow\\n(Stem cell) transplantation from suitable allogenic or\\nautologous donor (HLA and mixed lymphocytes culture-matched) is used in preB and pre-T cell ALL in adults withrelapses. Bone marrow transplantation has resulted in curein about half the cases.\\nPrognosis and disease-free survival of children with both\\npre-B cell an dpre-T cell ALL is better than in adults. Mean\\nsurvival with treatment in children without CNS prophylaxisis 33 months, while with CNS prophylaxis is 60 months ormore. Adult pre-T cell ALL, however, is as grave as AMLand median survival is 12-18 months. Patients having limiteddisease confined to lymph nodes in both pre-B and pre-Tcell type have a higher cure rate and better prognosis.\\nThe salient differences between the two main forms of\\nacute leukaemia (AML and ALL) are summarised inTable 14.12.\\nPERIPHERAL(MA TURE) B-CELL MALIGNANCIES\\nPeripheral or mature B-cell cancers are the most common\\nlymphoid malignancies. These arise from the stage oflymphoid cells at which they become committed to B celldevelopment, acquire surface characteristics  and begin tosecrete immunoglobulins. It includes following commonexamples.Figure 14.19 PBF findings in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The cells are large,  with round to convoluted nuclei having high N/C rati o\\nand no cytoplasmic granularity.\\n375CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nB-CELL CLL/SLL (CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC\\nLEUKAEMIA/ SMALL LYMPHOCYTIC LYMPHOMA)\\nAs the name implies, this subtype may present as leukaemia\\nor lymphoma constituting 9% of all lymphoid neoplasms.As lymphoid leukaemia (CLL), this is the most common formwhile as SLL it constitutes 7%  of all NHLs. B-cell CLL/SLLoccurs more commonly in middle and older age groups (over50 years of age) with a male preponderance (male-femaleratio 2:1).\\nClinical Features\\nThe condition may remain asymptomatic, or may have an\\ninsidious onset and  may present with nonspecific clinical\\nfeatures. Common presenting manifestations are as under:1.\\nFeatures of anaemia  such as gradually increasing\\nweakness, fatigue and dyspnoea.2. Enlargement of superficial lymph nodes  is a very common\\nfinding. The lymph nodes are usually symmetricallyenlarged, discrete and non-tender.3.Splenomegaly  and hepatomegaly  are usual.\\n4.Haemorrhagic manifestations  are found in case of CLL with\\nthrombocytopenia.5.Susceptibility to  Infections,  particularly of respiratory tract,\\nare common in CLL.6.Less common findings  are: mediastinal pressure, tonsillar\\nenlargement, disturbed vision, and bone and joint pains.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES\\nThe diagnosis of CLL can usually be made on the basis of\\nphysical findings and blood smear examination(Fig. 14.20):\\nI. BLOOD PICTURE.  The findings of routine blood\\npicture are as under:\\n1. Anaemia.  Anaemia is usually mild to moderate and\\nnormocytic normochromic in type. Mild reticulocytosis\\nmay be present. About 20% cases develop a Coombs’-positive autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.\\n2. White blood cells.  Typically, there is marked leuco-\\ncytosis but less than that seen in CML (50,000-200,000/\\nμl). Usually, more than 90% of leucocytes are mature small\\nlymphocytes. Smudge or basket cells (degenerated forms)are present due to damaged nuclei of fragile malignantlymphocytes. The absolute neutrophil count is, however,generally within normal range. Granulocytopenia occurswhen disease is fairly advanced.\\n3. Platelets.  The platelet count is normal or moderately\\nreduced as an autoimmune phenomenon.\\nII. BONE MARROW EXAMINATION.  The typical\\nfindings are as under:\\n1. Increased lymphocyte count (25-95%).2.

LYMPH NODE BIOPSY.  Cases with lymphadeno-\\npathy at presentation show replacement of the lymph\\nnode by diffuse proliferation of well-differentiated,mature, small and uniform lymphocytes without anycytologic atypia or significant mitoses (Fig. 14.21,B).  These\\ncells are of monoclonal B-cell origin having immunologicfeatures of mantle zone B-cells.\\nIV. OTHER INVESTIGATIONS. These include the\\nfollowing:\\n1. Erythrocyte rosette test  with mouse red cells is positive\\nin more than 95% of cases indicating that CLL is a\\nmonoclonal B cell neoplasm.Figure 14.20 PBF in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). There is large excess of mature and small differentiated lymphocytes and some\\ndegenerated forms appearing as bare smudged nuclei.\\n2. Positive for B-cell markers e.g. typically CD5 positive;\\nother pan-B cell markers are CD19, CD20, CD23, surfaceimmunoglobulins of various classes, monoclonal lightchains ( λ or κ type).\\n3. Serum immunoglobulin levels  are generally reduced.\\n4. Coombs’ test  is positive in 20% cases.\\n5. Cytogenetic abnormalities , most commonly trisomy 12\\nseen in about 25% cases.\\nTreatment and Prognosis\\nUnlike other leukaemias, none of the available drugs and\\nradiation therapy are capable of eradicating CLL and induce\\nFigure 14.21 Prototypes of non-Hodgkin’s\\nlymphoma—small lymphocytic lymphoma SLL/\\nCLL (B) and follicular lymphoma (C) contrasted\\nwith structure of normal lymph node (A).\\n377CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuestrue complete remission. Treatment is, therefore, palliative\\nand symptomatic, and with optimal management patient canusually lead a relatively normal life for several years. Theseapproaches include: alkylating drugs (e.g. chlorambucil,cyclophosphamide), corticosteroids and radiotherapy.Splenectomy is indicated in cases of CLL with autoimmunehaemolytic anaemia.\\nPrognosis of CLL/SLL is generally better than CML since\\nblastic transformation seldom occurs.  Prognosis generally\\ncorrelates with the stage of disease as under:\\nStage A:  characterised by lymphocytosis alone, or with limited\\nlymphadenopathy, has a good prognosis (median survival\\nmore than 10 years).\\nStage B:  having lymphocytosis with associated significant\\nlymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly has\\nintermediate prognosis (median survival about 5 years).\\nStage C:  having lymphocytosis with associated anaemia and\\nthrombocytopenia has a worse prognosis (median survival\\nof less than 2 years).\\nGenerally, the course is indolent. However, some cases of\\nSLL may transform into more aggressive diffuse large B-celllymphoma, or may be associated with occurrence of an IgMmonoclonal gammopathy called Waldenström’s macro-globulinaemia (page 384).\\nFOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA\\nIn the earlier classification schemes, follicular lymphoma was\\nknown as nodular (poorly-differentiated) or follicularlymphoma (predominantly small/large cleaved cell type).Follicular lymphomas comprise approximately 22% of allNHLs.  Follicular lymphomas occur in older individuals,most frequently presenting with painless peripherallymphadenopathy which is usually waxing and waning type.In contrast to diffuse lymphomas, extranodal involvementis also infrequent.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.   Following features are\\nseen: Lymph node biopsy:  As the name suggests, follicular\\nlymphoma is characterised by follicular or nodular patternof growth. The nuclei of tumour cells may vary frompredominantly small cleaved (or indented) topredominantly large cleaved variety (Fig. 14.21,C).  The\\nformer is more common, has infrequent mitoses and therate of growth slow (low grade), while the patients withlarge cell lymphoma have high proliferation and progressrapidly (high grade). In all follicular lymphomas, thetumour cells are positive for pan-B markers such as CD19and CD20 along with expression of  BCL-2 protein (for\\ndistinction from normal germinal centre which is BCL-2\\nnegative). Cytogenetic studies show characteristic trans-location t(14;18) in tumour cells.\\nBlood and bone marrow:  Peripheral blood involvement\\nas occurs in SLL is uncommon in this variety. Infiltration\\nin the bone marrow is typically paratrabecular.\\nAbout half the cases of low-grade follicular lymphomas,\\nduring their indolent biologic course, may evolve into diffuselarge B-cell lymphoma. Median survival for patients with\\nlow grade follicular lymphoma is 7-9 years.\\nDiffuse Large B-cell L ymphoma\\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma, earlier termed as diffuse\\npoorly-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma or follicular\\ncentre cell diffuse large, cleaved/non-cleaved lymphoma, isthe most common comprising about 31% of all NHLs. It\\noccurs in older patients with mean age of 60 years. It may\\npresent primarily as a lymph node disease or at extranodal\\nsites. About half the cases have extranodal involvement at\\nthe time of presentation, particularly in the bone marrow\\nand the alimentary tract. Primary diffuse large B-cell\\nlymphoma of CNS may also occur.\\nA few subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are\\ndescribed with distinct clinicopathologic settings:\\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV)  infection has been etiologically\\nimplicated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in immuno-\\nsuppressed patients  of AIDS and organ transplant cases.\\nHuman herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8)  infection along with\\npresence of immunosuppression is associated with a subtypeof diffuse large B-cell lymphoma presenting with effusion,\\ntermed primary effusion lymphoma.\\nMediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is diagnosed in patients\\nwith prominent involvement of mediastinum, occurs in\\nyoung females and frequently spreads to CNS and abdominalviscera.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.   This variety is the diffuse\\ncounterpart of follicular large cleaved cell lymphoma i.e.\\nit is composed of large cleaved cells spread in a diffuse\\npattern. The cytoplasm in these tumour cells is pale andabundant while the nuclei have prominent 1-2 nucleoli.\\nImmunophenotypic markers for pan-B cells (CD19, CD20)\\nare positive, besides overexpression of surface immuno-\\nglobulins (IgM, IgG and light chains) and of BCL-2 protein.\\nIn general, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas are aggressive\\ntumours and disseminate widely.\\nBURKITT’S LYMPHOMA/LEUKAEMIA\\n Burkitt’s lymphoma/leukaemia is an uncommon tumour in\\nadults but comprises about 30% of childhood NHLs. Burkitt’sleukaemia corresponds to L3 ALL of FAB grouping and isuncommon.  Three subgroups of Burkitt’s lymphoma arerecognised: African endemic, sporadic and immunodeficiency-\\nassociated .:\\nAfrican endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma  was first described\\nin African children, predominantly presenting as jaw tumourthat spreads to extranodal sites such as the bone marrowand meninges. The relationship of this tumour withoncogenic virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), has been discussed\\nin Chapter 8.\\nSporadic Burkitt’s lymphoma  is a related tumour in which\\nthe tumour cells are similar to those of Burkitt’s lymphoma\\nbut are more pleomorphic and may sometimes be multi-nucleated. Sporadic variety has a propensity to infiltrate the\\nCNS and is more aggressive than true Burkitt’s lymphoma.\\nImmunodeficiency-associated Burkitt’s lymphoma includes\\ncases seen in association with HIV infection.378SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.   Histologically  all three\\ntypes of Burkitt’s lymphoma are similar. Tumour cells are\\nintermediate in size, non-cleaved, and homogeneous insize and shape.  The nuclei are round to oval and contain2-5 nucleoli. The cytoplasm is basophilic and contains lipidvacuolation. The tumour cells have a very high mitoticrate, and therefore high cell death. This feature accountsfor presence of numerous macrophages in the backgroundof this tumour containing phagocytosed tumour debrisgiving it a ‘starry sky’ appearance (Fig. 14.22).\\nBurkitt’s leukaemia is identified by classical appearance\\nof monomorphic medium-sized cells having round nuclei,frequent mitoses, multiple nucleoli, and basophiliccytoplasm with vacuoles.\\nImmunophenotypically, the tumour cells are positive\\nfor CD19 and CD10 and surface immunoglobulin IgM.Typical cytogenetic abnormalities in the tumour cells aret(8;14) and  t(8;22) involving MYC gene on chromosome\\n8, with overexpression of MYC protein having trans-forming activity.\\nBurkitt’s lymphoma is a high-grade tumour and is a very\\nrapidly progressive human tumour.\\nEXTRANODAL MARGINAL ZONE B-CELL LYMPHOMA\\nOF MAL T TYPE ( SYNONYM:  MALTOMA)\\nThis type comprises about 8% of all NHLs. In the earlierclassification, it was included under SLL, but in the WHOscheme it is categorised separately for 2 reasons: etiologicassociation with H. pylori  infection and occurrence at\\nextranodal sites. Most frequent is gastric lymphoma of MALTtype with its characteristic etiologic association with H. pylori ;\\nother extranodal sites for this subtype of NHL are intestine,orbit, lung, thyroid, salivary glands and CNS. About halfthe cases of gastric MALT lymphoma show Genetic mutationt(11;18). Median age for this form of NHL is 60 years andoften remains localised to the organ of origin but mayinfiltrate the regional lymph nodes.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  It is characterised by\\ndiffuse infiltration by monoclonal small B lymphocyteswhich are negative for CD5.\\nMALT lymphoma has a good prognosis. Rarely, it may\\nbe more aggressive and may metastasise, or transform intodiffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\\nMANTLE CELL  \\nLYMPHOMA\\nThis subtype of NHL comprises about 8% of all NHLs. It\\nwas earlier included in SLL but has been identified as aseparate subtype due to characteristic chromosomaltranslocation, t(11;14) and overexpression of BCL-1 and\\nsurface immunoglobulins IgM and IgD  protein. However,\\nboth SLL and mantle cell NHL are positive for CD5 antigen.Patients of mantle cell lymphoma are generally older males.The disease involves bone marrow, spleen, liver and bowel.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Mantle cell lymphoma\\narises from B-cells of mantle zone of normal lymphoidfollicle. The tumour cells show diffuse or nodular patternof involvement in the lymph node and have somewhatindented nuclei.\\nIt is more aggressive than other types of SLLs.\\nHAIRY CELL LEUKAEMIA\\nHairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an unusual and uncommon\\nform of  B-cell malignancy characterised by presence of hairy\\ncells in the blood and bone marrow and splenomegaly. Itoccurs in the older males. HCL is characterised clinically bythe manifestations due to infiltration of reticuloendothelialorgans (bone marrow, liver and spleen) and, hence, itsprevious name as leukaemic reticuloendotheliosis. Patients have\\nsusceptibility to infection with M. avium intercellulare .\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Laboratory diagnosis is\\nmade by the presence of pancytopenia due to marrowFigure 14.22 Burkitt’s lymphoma. The tumour shows uniform cells having high mitotic rate. Scattered among the tumour cells are benign\\nmacrophages surrounded by a clear space giving ‘starry sky’ appearance.\\n379CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nfailure and splenic sequestration, and identification of\\ncharacteristic hairy cells in the blood and bone marrow.Hairy cells are abnormal mononuclear cells with hairycytoplasmic projections which are seen in the bonemarrow, peripheral blood and spleen. These cells are bestrecognised under phase contrast microscopy but may alsobe visible in routine blood smears (Fig. 14.23) . These\\nleukaemic ‘hairy cells’ have characteristically positivecytochemical staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase\\n(TRAP).\\nThe controversy on the origin of hairy cells whether\\nthese cells represent neoplastic T cells, B cells ormonocytes, is settled with the molecular analysis of thesecells which assigns them B cell origin  expressing CD19,\\nCD20 and CD22 antigen. In addition to B cell markers,hairy cells are also positive for CD11, CD25 and CD103.\\nThe disease often runs a chronic course requiring\\nsupportive care. The mean survival is 4-5 years. Patientsrespond to splenectomy, α-interferon therapy and 2-\\nchlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA).\\nOTHER B-CELL MALIGNANCIES\\nBrief mention is made below on the other types of B-cell\\nmalignant tumours given in the  WHO classification inTable 14.8:\\ni) B-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia  is involvement of blood and\\nbone marrow by large B lymphocytes having prominent\\nnucleoli. These patients have leucocytosis with splenomegalyand lymphadenopathy.\\nii) Splenic marginal zone lymphoma is another uncommon B-\\ncell neoplasm in which the splenic white pulp is infiltrated\\nby small monoclonal B lymphocytes. The condition has aslow and indolent behaviour.\\niii) Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma  is tissue manifestation of\\nWaldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, discussed later in thischap ter. There is infiltration by IgM-secreting monoclonal\\nlymphoplasmacytic cells into lymph nodes, spleen, bone\\nmarrow, and sometimes in the peripheral blood. It behaves\\nlike an indolent B-cell lymphoma. Etiologic association of\\nthis form of lymphoma with hepatitis C virus infection hasalso been proposed.\\niv) Nodal marginal zone lymphoma (monocytoid B-cell lymphoma)\\nis another uncommon subtype of aggressive NHL. At\\npresentation, the patients often have disseminated disease,involving bone marrow and leukaemic picture.\\nPERIPHERAL(MATURE) T-CELL MALIGNANCIES\\nPeripheral or mature T-cell lymphoid malignancies are\\nrelatively less common compared to mature B cell cancers.\\nThese arise at the stage when the lymphoid cells migrate tothymus and become committed to T-cell differentiation byacquiring T cell antigen receptor genes. A few commonexamples are discussed below.\\nMYCOSIS FUNGOIDES/SÉZAR Y\\n SYNDROME\\nMycosis fungoides is a slowly evolving cutaneous T-cell\\nlymphoma occurring in middle-aged adult males.\\nMORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES. The condition is often\\npreceded by eczema or dermatitis for several years(premycotic stage ). This is followed by infiltration by CD4+T-\\ncells in the epidermis and dermis as a plaque ( plaque stage )\\nand eventually as tumour stage . The disease may spread to\\nviscera and to peripheral blood as a leukaemiacharacterised by Sézary cells having cerebriform nucleitermed as Sézary syndrome.\\nMycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome is an indolent NHL\\nand has a median survival of 8 to 9 years.\\nADULT T -CELL \\nLYMPHOMA/LEUKAEMIA (ATLL)\\nThis is an uncommon T-cell malignancy but has gained much\\nprominence due to association with retrovirus, human T-cellFigure 14.23 Hairy cell leukaemia. A, Peripheral blood shows presence of a leukaemic cells with hairy cytoplasmic projections B, Trephine\\nbiopsy shows replacement of marrow spaces with abnormal mononuclear cells.\\n380SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissueslymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) (Chapter 8). The infection is\\nacquired by blood transfusion, breast milk, sexual route ortransplacentally.  ATLL is common in Japan, the Caribbeanand parts of the US but is rare in rest of the world.\\nMORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES. The involved lymph\\nnodes have proliferation of CD4 positive large atypical T-cells with indented nuclei, called ‘flower cells’, mostprominent in the paracortical zone. The blood also showslarge pleomorphic T-cell leukaemia.\\nThe patients have usually widespread lymphadenopathy\\nwith leukaemia, hepatosplenomegaly and involvement ofskin and leptomeninges. This disease runs a fulminantcourse.\\nANAPLASTIC LARGE T/NK CELL LYMPHOMA\\nThis relatively newer entity is the T-cell counterpart of diffuse\\nlarge B-cell lymphoma and was previously included undermalignant histiocytosis or diagnosed as anaplastic carcinoma.\\nMORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES. There is diffuse\\ninfiltration of lymph nodes by anaplastic T-cells/null cellspositive for CD30 (Ki-1). Cytogenetic abnormality consistsof t(2;5). Involvement of the skin occurs frequently andproduces an indolent cutaneous large T/null celllymphoma.\\nPERIPHERAL T-CELL LYMPHOMAS\\nThis group includes a variety of aggressive T-cell lymphomas\\nwhich are morphologically heterogeneous but have commonimmunotypic features of mature T-cells (CD4+, CD8+, orboth). These are more common in young adults and oftenhave bone marrow involvement at presentation. Subtypesof peripheral T-cell lymphomas include the followingsyndromes:i) Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is relatively morecommon subtype, comprising about 20% of all T-cell NHLs.The patients have profound constitutional symptoms (fever,weight loss, skin rash), generalised lymphadenopathy andpolyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia.ii) Extranodal T/NK cell lymphoma of nasal type is involvement\\nof the upper airways by the monoclonal T-cells. The conditionis quite aggressive and was earlier called as lethal midline\\ngranuloma or angiocentric lymphoma . The patients have\\nhaemophagocytic syndrome. During the course of thedisease, blood and bone marrow may be involved producingleukaemic picture.iii) Enteropathy type T-cell lymphoma  is a rare aggressive\\nlymphoma seen in association with untreated cases of gluten-\\nsensitive enteropathy.iv) Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma,  unlike other lymphomas\\nwhich occur as tumour masses, is characterised by sinusoidal\\ninfiltration of the liver, spleen and bone marrow by\\nmonoclonal T-cells. Systemic features are often present.\\nStaging of NHL\\nThe Ann Arbor staging system developed for Hodgkin’s\\ndisease (see Table 14.10, page 372) is used for staging NHLtoo. This staging system depends upon the number andlocation of nodal and extranodal sites involved, and presence\\nor absence of constitutional (B) symptoms. But the concept\\nof staging is much less helpful in NHL than in Hodgkin’s\\ndisease because the prognosis is not correlated with the\\nanatomic site of involvement of the disease.\\nPLASMA CELL DISORDERS\\nThe plasma cell disorders are characterised by abnormal\\nproliferation of immunoglobulin-producing cells and resultin accumulation of monoclonal immunoglobulin in serum\\nand urine. The group as a whole is known by various\\nsynonyms such as plasma cell dyscrasias, paraproteinaemias,\\ndysproteinaemias and monoclonal gammopathies.  The group\\ncomprises the following six disease entities:\\n1.Multiple myeloma\\n2.Localised plasmacytoma\\n3.\\nLymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (discussed above)\\n3. Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia4. Heavy chain disease\\n5. Primary amyloidosis (Chapter 4)6. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance\\n(MGUS).\\nThe feature common to all plasma cell disorders is the\\nneoplastic proliferation of cells derived from B-lymphocytelineage. These disorders constitute 16% of all B-cell\\nmalignancies. Normally B lymphocytes have surfaceimmunoglobulin molecules of both M and G heavy chains.Under normal circumstances, B-cells are stimulated byexposure to surface immunoglobulin-specific antigen and\\nmature to form IgG-producing plasma cells. However, in\\nplasma cell disorders, the control over this process is lostand results in abnormal production of immunoglobulin thatappears in the blood and urine. These disorders differ from\\nother B-cell lymphoid malignancies in having monoclonal\\nsynthesis of immunoglobulins and lack of prominent lymph-adenopathy. In addition to the rise in complete immuno-globulins, plasma cell disorders synthesise excess of light\\nchains (kappa or lambda), or heavy chains of a single class\\n(alpha, gamma, or mu). Bence Jones proteins are free light\\nchains present in blood and excreted in urine of some plasmacell disorders.\\nAfter these brief general comments, we now turn to the\\ndiscussion of the specific plasma cell disorders.\\nMULTIPLE MYELOMA\\nMultiple myeloma is a multifocal malignant proliferation of\\nplasma cells derived from a single clone of cells (i.e.monoclonal). The terms multiple myeloma is usedinterchangeably with myeloma. The tumour, its products (Mcomponent), and the host response result in the mostimportant and most common syndrome in the group ofplasma cell disorders that produces osseous as well asextraosseous manifestations. Multiple myeloma primarilyaffects the elderly (peak incidence in 5th-6th decades) andincreases in incidence with age. It is rare under the age of 40.Myeloma is m ore common in males than females.381CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular TissuesEtiology and Pathogenesis\\nMyeloma is a monoclonal proliferation of B-cells. The etiology\\nof myeloma remains unknown. However, following factorsand abnormalities have been implicated:\\n1. Radiation exposure.  Large dose exposure to radiation\\nwith a long latent period has been seen in myeloma. For\\ninstance, survivors of nuclear attack in World War-IIdeveloped myeloma about 20 years later.\\n2.Epidemiologic factors.  Myeloma has higher incidence in\\nblacks. Occupational exposure to petroleum products has\\nbeen associated with higher incidence. Certain occupationssuch as farmers, wood workers and leather workers are moreprone.\\n3\\n. Karyotypic abnormalities. Several chromosomal\\nalterations have been observed in cases of myeloma, which\\ninclude following translocations and deletions:i)Translocations t(11;14)(q13;q32) and t(4;14)(p16;q32).\\nii)Deletion of 13q.\\n4\\n. Oncogenes-antioncogenes.  Overexpresion and muta-\\ntions in following genes have been noted in proliferation oftumour cells in myeloma:i) Overexpression of MYC   and RAS growth promoting\\noncogenes in some cases.ii)  Mutation in p53 and RB growth-suppressing antioncogene\\nin some cases.\\nBased on above, the molecular pathogenesis  of multiple\\nmyeloma and its major manifestations can be explained asunder and is schematically illustrated in Fig. 14.24:\\n1. Cell-surface adhesion molecules  bind myeloma cells to bone\\nmarrow stromal cells and extracellular matrix proteins.\\n2. This binding triggers adhesion-mediated signaling  and\\nmediates production of several cytokines  by fibroblasts and\\nmacrophages of the marrow. These include: IL-6, VEGF,\\nTGF β, TNF- α IL-1, lymphotoxin, macrophage inhibitory\\nfactor-1 α (MIP-1 α) and receptor activator of nuclear\\nfactor- κB (RANK) ligand.\\n3. Adhesion-mediated signaling affects the cell cycle viacyclin-D and p21 causing abnormal production of myeloma\\n(M) proteins.4. IL-6 cytokine  plays a central role in cytokine-mediated\\nsignaling and causes proliferation as well as cell survival oftumour cells via its antiapoptotic effects on tumour cells.\\n5. Certain cytokines produced by myeloma cells bring about\\nbony destruction by acting as osteoclast-activating factor (OAF).\\nThese are: IL-1, lymphotoxin, VEGF, macrophage inhibitoryfactor-1 α (MIP-1 α), receptor activator of NF- κB ligand, and\\ntumour necrosis factor (TNF).\\n6. Other effects of adhesion-mediated and cytokine-mediated\\nsignaling are development of drug resistance  and migration  of\\ntumour cells in the bone marrow milieu.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Myeloma affects princi-\\npally the bone marrow though during the course of thedisease other organs are also involved. Therefore, thepathologic findings are described below under twoheadings— osseous (bone marrow) lesions  and extraosseous\\nlesions.\\nA. OSSEOUS (BONE MARROW) LESIONS.  In more\\nthan 95% of cases, multiple myeloma begins in the bone\\nmarrow. In majority of cases, the disease involves multiplebones. By the time the diagnosis is made, most of the bonemarrow is involved. Most commonly affected bones arethose with red marrow i.e. skull, spine, ribs and pelvis,but later long bones of the limbs are also involved\\n(Fig. 14.25).  The lesions begin in the medullary cavity,\\nerode the cancellous bone and ultimately cause\\ndestruction of the bony cortex. Radiographically, theselesions appear as punched out, rounded, 1-2 cm sizeddefects in the affected bone.\\nGrossly,  the normal bone marrow is replaced by soft,\\ngelatinous, reddish-grey tumours. The affected boneusually shows focal or diffuse osteoporosis.Microscopically,  the diagnosis of multiple myeloma can\\nbe usually established by examining bone marrowaspiration from an area of bony rarefaction. However, ifthe bone marrow aspiration yields dry tap or negative\\nresults, biopsy of radiologically abnormal or tender site\\nis usually diagnostic. The following features characterisea case of myeloma:Figure 14.24 Schematic diagram showing molecular pathogenesis\\nof multiple myeloma and its major manifestations.\\n382SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\ni) Cellularity:  There is usually hypercellularity of the\\nbone marrow.\\nii) Myeloma cells:  Myeloma cells constitute >10% of the\\nmarrow cellularity. These cells may form clumps or sheets,\\nor may be scattered among the normal haematopoieticcells. Myeloma cells may vary in size from small,differentiated cells resembling normal plasma cells tolarge, immature and undifferentiated cells. Binucleate andmultinucleate cells are sometimes present. The nucleus\\nof myeloma cell is commonly eccentric similar to plasmacells but usually lacks the cart-wheel chromatin pattern\\nseen in classical plasma cells. Nucleoli are frequently\\npresent. The cytoplasm of these cells is abundant and\\nbasophilic with perinuclear halo, vacuolisation andcontains Russell bodies consisting of hyaline globulescomposed of synthesised immunoglobulin (Fig. 14.26).\\nIn addition to neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells\\nin multiple myeloma, reactive plasmacytosis  in the bone\\nmarrow can occur in some other disorders; these include:aplastic anaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, cirrhosis of\\nliver, metastatic cancer and chronic inflammation and\\ninfections such as tuberculosis. However, in all theseconditions the plasma cells are mature and they do notexceed 10% of the total marrow cells.\\nB. EXTRAOSSEOUS LESIONS.  Late in the course of\\ndisease, lesions at several extraosseous sites become\\nevident. Some of the commonly involved sites are as\\nunder:\\n1. Blood.  Approximately 50% of patients with multiple\\nmyeloma have a few atypical plasma cells in the blood.\\nOther changes in the blood in myeloma are the presence\\nof anaemia (usually normocytic normochromic type),\\nmarked red cell rouleaux formation due to hypervisco-sity of blood, and an elevated ESR.\\n2. Myeloma kidney.  Renal involvement in myeloma\\ncalled myeloma nephrosis occurs in many cases (Chapter\\n22). The main mechanism of myeloma kidney is byfiltration of light chain proteins (Bence Jones proteins)which are precipitated in the distal convoluted tubules in\\ncombination with Tamm-Horsfall proteins as tubular\\ncasts. The casts may be surrounded by some multinucleategiant-cells and a few inflammatory cells.\\n3.\\nMyeloma neuropathy.  Infiltration of the nerve trunk\\nroots by tumour cells produces nonspecific polyneuro-\\npathy. Pathologic fractures, particularly of the vertebrae,\\nmay occur causing neurologic complications.\\n4. Systemic amyloidosis.  Systemic primary generalised\\namyloidosis (AL amyloid) may occur in 10% cases of\\nmultiple myeloma and involve multiple organs andsystems.Figure 14.25 The major sites of lesions in multiple myeloma.\\nFigure 14.26 Bone marrow aspirate in myeloma showing numerous plasma cells, many with abnormal features.\\n383CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissues5. Liver, spleen involvement.  Involvement of the liver\\nand spleen by myeloma cells sufficient to cause\\nhepatomegaly, and splenomegaly occurs in a smallpercentage of cases.\\nClinical Features\\nThe clinical manifestations of myeloma result from the effects\\nof infiltration of the bones and other organs by neoplasticplasma cells and from immunoglobulin synthesis. Theprincipal clinical features are as under:\\n1.Bone pain  is the most common symptom. The pain usually\\ninvolves the back and ribs. Pathological fractures may occur\\ncausing persistent localised pain. Bone pain results from theproliferation of tumour cells in the marrow and activation ofosteoclasts which destroy the bones.\\n2.Susceptibility to infections is the next most common clinical\\nfeature. Particularly common are bacterial infections such\\nas pneumonias and pyelonephritis. Increased susceptibilityto infection is related mainly to hypogammaglobulinaemia,and partly to granulocyte dysfunction and neutropenia.\\n3.Renal failure  occurs in about 25% of patients, while renal\\npathology occurs in 50% of cases. Causes of renal failure in\\nmyeloma are hypercalcaemia, glomerular deposits ofamyloid, hyperuricaemia and infiltration of the kidney bymyeloma cells.\\n4.Anaemia  occurs in about 80% of patients of myeloma and\\nis related to marrow replacement by the tumour cells\\n(myelophthisis) and inhibition of haematopoiesis.\\n5.Bleeding tendencies  may appear in some patients due to\\nthrombocytopenia, deranged platelet function and\\ninteraction of the M component with coagulation factors.\\n6. Hyperviscosity syndrome  owing to hyperglobulinaemia may\\nproduce headache, fatigue, visual disturbances and\\nhaemorrhages.\\n7. Neurologic symptoms  occur in a minority of patients and\\nare explained by hyperviscosity, cryoglobulins and amyloid\\ndeposits.\\n8. Biochemical abnormalities . These include the following:\\ni) hypercalcaemia due to destruction of bone;ii) hyperuricaemia from necrosis of tumour mass and from\\nuraemia related to renal failure; andiii) increased β-2 microglobulins and other globulins in urine\\nand serum.\\n9. POEMS syndrome  is seen in about 1% cases of myeloma\\nand includes simultaneous manifestations of polyneuro-\\npathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, multiple myeloma\\nand skin changes.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of myeloma is made by classic triad of features:\\n1.Marrow plasmacytosis  of more than 10%\\n2.Radiologic evidence of lytic bony lesions\\n3. Demonstration of serum and/or urine M component .\\nThere is rise in the total serum protein concentration due\\nto paraproteinaemia but normal serum immunoglobulins (IgG,\\nIgA and IgM) and albumin are depressed . Paraproteins are\\nabnormal immunoglobulins or their parts circulating in\\nplasma and excreted in urine. About two-third cases ofmyeloma excrete Bence Jones (light chain) proteins in theurine, consisting of either kappa ( κ) or lambda ( λ) light chains,\\nalong with presence of Bence Jones paraproteins in the serum.On serum electrophoresis, the paraprotein usually appearsas a single narrow homogeneous M-band  component, most\\ncommonly in the region of γ-globulin (Fig. 14.27).  Most\\nfrequent paraprotein is IgG seen in about 50% cases of\\nmyeloma, IgA in 25%, and IgD in 1%, while about 20%\\npatients have only light chains in serum and urine ( light chain\\nmyeloma ). Non-secretory myeloma  is absence of M-band on\\nserum and/or electrophoresis but presence of other twofeatures out of triad listed above. Though the commonestcause of paraproteinaemias is multiple myeloma, certainother conditions which may produce serum paraproteinsneed to be distinguished. These are as under:\\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance\\n(MGUS)\\nWaldenström’s macroglobulinaemia\\nBenign monoclonal gammopathy\\nB-cell lymphomas\\nCLL\\nLight chain disease\\nHeavy chain disease\\nCryoglobulinaemia.\\nFigure 14.27 Serum electrophoresis showing normal serum pattern (A), as contrasted with that in benign polyclonal gammopathy (B) and in\\nmonoclonal gammopathy (C), typical of plasma cell  myeloma.\\n384SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular TissuesTreatment and Prognosis\\nTreatment of multiple myeloma consists of systemic\\nchemotherapy in the form of alkylating agents and\\nsymptomatic supportive care. Autologous stem celltransplantation and interferon-therapy are the other moderntreatment modalities offered.  Poor prognostic predictors for\\nlower survival are: secretion of λ-light chain than those\\nsecreting κ-light chain, larger number of cytogenetic\\nabnormalities, and increased β-2 microglobulin level. The\\nmedian survival is 2 years after the diagnosis is made. Theterminal phase is marked by the development of\\npancytopenia, severe anaemia and sepsis.\\nLOCALISED PLASMACYTOMA\\nTwo variants of myeloma which do not fulfil the criteria of\\nclassical triad are the localised from of solitary bone\\nplasmacytoma  and extramedullary plasmacytoma. Both these are\\nassociated with M component in about a third of cases and\\noccur in young individuals. Solitary bone plasmacytoma is\\na lytic bony lesion without marrow plasmacytosis.\\nExtramedullary plasmacytoma involves most commonly thesubmucosal lymphoid tissue of nasopharynx or paranasalsinuses. Both variants have better prognosis than the classic\\nmultiple myeloma. Plasma cell granuloma,  on the other hand,\\nis an inflammatory condition having admixture of other\\ninflammatory cells with mature plasma cells, which can beeasily distinguished by a discernible observer.\\nWALDENSTRÖM’S MACROGLOBULINAEMIA\\nWaldenström’s macroglobulinaemia is an uncommon\\nmalignant proliferation of monoclonal B lymphocytes which\\nsecrete IgM paraproteins called macroglobulins as they have\\nhigh molecular weight. The condition is more common inmen over 50 years of age and behaves clinically like a slowlyprogressive lymphoma.\\nThe exact etiology  is not known but a possible relation-\\nship of IgM macroglobulin with myelin-associatedglycoprotein which is lost in degenerating diseases has beensuggested. The clinical evidence in favour is the appearance\\nof peripheral neuropathy before the occurrence of macro-\\nglobulinaemia in some patients.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Pathologically, the disease\\ncan be regarded as the hybrid between myeloma and smalllymphocytic lymphoma.\\nLike myeloma,  the disease involves the bone marrow,\\nbut unlike myeloma it usually does not cause extensivebony lesions or hypercalcaemia. The bone marrow shows\\npleomorphic infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells,\\nlymphocytoid plasma cells, mast cells and histiocytes. Likein myeloma, serum M component is present.\\nUnlike myeloma and more like small lymphocytic\\nlymphoma,  enlargement of lymph nodes, spleen and liver\\ndue to infiltration by similar type of cells is present more\\nfrequently.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical features of the disease\\nare due to both infiltration by the disease and paraproteinsin the blood.1.Hyperviscosity syndrome is the major clinical manifestation.\\nIt results in visual disturbances, weakness, fatiguability,weight loss and nervous system symptoms. Raynaud’sphenomenon may occur.\\n2.Moderate organomegaly  in the form of lymphadenopathy,\\nhepatomegaly and splenomegaly are frequently seen.\\n3.Anaemia  due to bone marrow failure may be present.\\n4.Bleeding tendencies  may occur due to interaction of\\nmacroglobulins with platelets and coagulation factors.\\nDIAGNOSIS.  Unlike myeloma, there are no characteristic\\nradiologic findings. The diagnosis rests on laboratory data\\nas under:\\n1.Pleomorphic bone marrow infiltration\\n2.Raised total serum protein concentration\\n3.\\nRaised serum monoclonal M component which is due to\\nIgM paraprotein4. Elevated ESR5. Normocytic normochromic anaemia.\\nThe management of the patients is similar to that of\\nmyeloma. Patients respond to chemotherapy with a median\\nsurvival of 3-5 years.\\nHEAVY CHAIN DISEASES\\nHeavy chain diseases are rare malignant proliferations of B-\\ncells accompanied by monoclonal excess of one of the heavychains. Depending upon the type of excessive heavy chain,three types— γ, α and μ, of heavy chain diseases are\\ndistinguished:\\nGAMMA HEAVY CHAIN DISEASE.  Also called Franklin’s\\ndisease, it is characterised by excess of mostly γ\\n1-paraprotein,\\nboth in the serum and urine and is demonstrated as M\\ncomponent. Clinically, the condition may develop at any ageand present with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly,hepatomegaly, involvement of pharyngeal lymphoid tissue(Waldeyer’s ring) and fever. Patients have rapidly downhillcourse due to severe and fatal infection.\\nALPHA HEAVY CHAIN DISEASE.  This is the commonest\\nof heavy chain diseases characterised by α-heavy chains in\\nthe plasma which are difficult to demonstrate in electropho-\\nresis due to rapid polymerisation. The patients present withbowel symptoms such as chronic diarrhoea, malabsorptionand weight loss and may have enlargement of abdominallymph nodes. Chemotherapy may induce long-termremissions.\\nMU HEAVY CHAIN DISEASE.  This is the rarest heavy\\nchain disease. The neoplastic B-cells produce μ heavy chains\\nwhich donot appear in the urine but κ light chains which are\\nalso produced appear in the urine. Another feature that\\ndistinguishes this type of heavy chain disease from the othersis the presence of vacuoles in the malignant B lymphocytes.\\nThe course and prognosis are like those of leukaemia orlymphoma.\\nMONOCLONAL GAMMOP \\nATHY OF UNDETERMINED\\nSIGNIFICANCE (MGUS)\\nA relatively recently desribed entity, monoclonal gammo-\\npathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), is increasingly385CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuesdiagnosed in asymptomatic healthy aging population—1%\\nat 50 years of age and in 10% individuals older than 75 years.This makes it the most common form of plasma cell dyscrasia.The defining criteria for MGUS are as under:i) M-protein in serum <3 gm/dlii) Marrow plasmacytosis <10%iii) No evidence of other B-cell proliferative disorderiv) Absence of myeloma-related end-organ tissue damage(i.e. absence of lytic bone lesions, high calcium level,anaemia).\\nThe condition needs to be cautiously distinguished from\\nmyeloma and long term follow-up is required. In fact, MGUShas been considered as a forerunner of multiple myeloma inmany studies because MGUS has been found to have thesame chromosomal abnormalities as in myeloma.\\nLYMPH NODE METASTATIC TUMOURS\\nThe regional lymph nodes draining the site of a primary\\nmalignant tumour are commonly enlarged. This enlargementmay be due to benign reactive hyperplasia  or metastatic tumour\\ndeposits.\\n1.Benign reactive hyperplasia,  as already discussed (page\\n343), is due to immunologic reaction by the lymph node in\\nresponse to tumour-associated antigens. It may be expressedas sinus histiocytosis, follicular hyperplasia, plasmacytosisand occasionally may show non-caseating granulomas.\\n2. Metastatic deposits  in regional lymph nodes occur most\\ncommonly from carcinomas and malignant melanoma.\\nSarcomas often disseminate via haematogenous route butuncommonly may metastasise to the regional lymph nodes.Metastatic tumour cells from the primary malignant tumourare drained via lymphatics into the subcapsular sinusesinitially but subsequently the lymph node stroma is alsoinvaded. The pushing margins of advancing metastatictumour in stroma of lymph node is characteristically welldemarcated. Areas of necrosis are frequent in metastatic carci-nomas (Fig. 14.28).\\nThe morphologic features of primary malignant tumour\\nare recapitulated in metastatic tumour in lymph nodes.\\nHISTIOCYTIC NEOPLASMS:\\nLANGERHANS’ CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS\\nLangerhans’ cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a group of raremalignant proliferations of dendritic cells or macrophagesand includes three clinicopathologically related conditionsocurring in children: eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Letterer-Siwe syndrome. Earlier, thisgroup was referred to as histiocytosis-X but now followingfacts about this group are known:\\nFirstly,  histiocytosis-X are not proliferations of unknown\\norigin (X-for unknown) but proliferating cells are actuallyLangerhans’ cells of marrow origin. Langerhans’ cells arenormally present mainly in the epidermis of the skin but alsoin some other organs.\\nSecondly,  the three conditions included under histio-\\ncytosis-X are actually different expression of the same basicdisorder. This concept has emerged from 2 features:i) Demonstration of common antigens on these cells byimmunohistochemical stains  for S-100 protein, CD1a and HLA-\\nDR.\\nii) Electron microscopic demonstration of histiocytosis-X bodies\\nor Birbeck granules  in the cytoplasm. These are rod-shaped\\nstructures having dilated tennis-racket like terminal end.\\nTheir function is not known but they arise from receptor-mediated endocytosis of langerin found in human epidermalcells, a protein involved in Birbeck granule biosynthesis.\\nThe three disorders included in the group are briefly\\nconsidered below.\\nEosinophilic Granuloma\\nUnifocal eosinophilic granuloma is more common (60%) than\\nthe multifocal variety which is often a component of Hand-Schüller-Christian disease (described below). Most of thepatients are children and young adults, predominantly males.The condition commonly presents as a solitary osteolyticlesion in the femur, skull, vertebrae, ribs and pelvis. Thediagnosis requires biopsy of the lytic bone lesion.\\nMicroscopically,  the lesion consists largely of closely-\\npacked aggregates of macrophages admixed with variablenumber of eosinophils  (Fig. 14.29).  The macrophages\\ncontain droplets of fat or a few granules of brown pigmentindicative of phagocytic activity. A few multinucleatemacrophages may also be seen. The cytoplasm of thesemacrophages may contain rod-shaped inclusions calledhistiocytosis-X bodies or Birbeck granules, best seen by\\nelectron microscopy .\\nClinically,  unifocal eosinophilic granuloma is a benign\\ndisorder. The bony lesion remains asymptomatic until theerosion of the bone causes pain or fracture. Spontaneousfibrosis or healing may occur in some cases, while othersmay require curettage or radiotherapy.\\nHand-Schüller-Christian Disease\\nA triad of features consisting of multifocal bony defects, diabetes\\ninsipidus  and exophthalmos  is termed Hand-Schüller-Christian\\ndisease. The disease develops in children under 5 years of\\nFigure 14.28 Metastatic carcinomatous deposits in the matted mass\\nof lymph nodes. There are areas of necrosis in the circumscribed nodular\\nareas.386SECTION II Haematology and Lymphoreticular Tissues\\nage. The multifocal lytic bony lesions may develop at any\\nsite. Orbital lesion causes exophthalmos, while involvementof the hypothalamus causes diabetes insipidus. Multiplespherical lesions in the lungs are frequently present. Half\\nthe patients have involvement of the liver, spleen and lymph\\nnodes.\\nMicroscopically,  the lesions are indistinguishable from\\nthose of unifocal eosinophilic granuloma.\\nClinically,  the affected children frequently have fever,\\nskin lesions, recurrent pneumonitis and other infections.Though the condition is benign, it is more disabling than the\\nunifocal eosinophilic granuloma. The lesions may resolve\\nspontaneously or may require chemotherapy or radiation.\\nLetterer-Siwe Disease\\nLetterer-Siwe disease is an acute disseminated form of LCH\\noccurring in infants and children under 2 years of age. The\\ndisease is characterised by hepatosplenomegaly, lymph-\\nadenopathy, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leucopenia.There is generalised hyperplasia of tissue macrophages invarious organs.\\nMicroscopically,  the involved organs contain aggregates\\nof macrophages which are pleomorphic and show nuclear\\natypia. The cytoplasm of these cells contains vacuoles and\\nrod-shaped histiocytosis-X bodies.\\nClinically,  the child has acute symptoms of fever, skin\\nrash, loss of weight, anaemia, bleeding disorders andenlargement of lymph nodes, liver and spleen. Cystic bonylesions may be apparent in the skull, pelvis and long bones.\\nIntense chemotherap y helps to control Letterer-Siwe disease\\nbut intercurrent infections result in fatal outcome in manycases. The condition is currently regarded as an unusual form\\nof malignant lymphoma.\\nSPLEEN\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe spleen is the largest lymphoid organ of the body. Under\\nnormal conditions, the average weight of the spleen is about150 gm in the adult. Normally, the organ lies well protectedby the 9th, 10th and 11th ribs in the upper left quadrant. Thesurface of the spleen is covered by a layer of peritoneumunderneath which the organ is ensheathed by a thin capsule.\\nFrom the capsule extend connective tissue trabeculae  into the\\npulp of the organ and serve as supportive network. Bloodenters the spleen by the splenic artery which divides intobranches that penetrate the spleen via trabeculae. From thetrabeculae arise small branches called central arterioles.  Blood\\nin the central arterioles empties partly into splenic venulesand from there into splenic vein, but largely into vascularsinuses of the red pulp and thence into the splenic venoussystem.\\nGrossly,  the spleen consists of homogeneous, soft, dark red\\nmass called the  red pulp and long oval grey-white nodules\\ncalled the  white pulp (malpighian bodies).\\nMicroscopically,  the red pulp consists of a network of thin-\\nwalled venous sinuses and adjacent blood spaces. The blood\\nspaces contain blood cells, lymphocytes and macrophagesand appear to be arranged in cords called splenic cords  or\\ncords of Billroth. The white pulp is made up of lymphocytes\\nsurrounding an eccentrically placed arteriole. Theperiarteriolar lymphocytes are mainly T-cells, while at otherplaces the lymphocytes have a germinal centre composedprincipally of B-cells surrounded by densely packedlymphocytes.\\nThe spleen is a lymphoreticular organ that performs at\\nleast the following four  functions:\\n1.Like other lymphoid tissues, it is an organ of the immune\\nsystem where B and T lymphocytes multiply and help inimmune responses.\\n2.The spleen plays an active role in sequestering and\\nremoving normal and abnormal blood cells.3.\\nThe vasculature of the spleen plays a role in regulating\\nportal blood flow.4. Under pathologic conditions, the spleen may become the\\nsite of extramedullary haematopoiesis.\\nThe spleen is rarely the primary site of disease. Being the\\nlargest lymphoreticular organ, it is involved secondarily ina wide variety of systemic disorders which manifest mostcommonly as splenic enlargement (splenomegaly) describedbelow. A few other systemic involvements such as splenicinfarcts and chronic venous congestion (CVC) of spleen havealready been considered in Chapter 5 of General Pathology.\\nSPLENOMEGALY\\nEnlargement of the spleen termed splenomegaly, occurs in a\\nwide variety of disorders which increase the cellularity andvascularity of the organ. Many of the causes are exaggeratedFigure 14.29 Langerhans cell histiocytosis—eosinophilic\\ngranuloma. Bone biopsy shows presence of infiltrate by collections of\\nhistiocytes having vesicular nuclei admixed with eosinophils.\\n387CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuesforms of normal splenic function. Splenic enlargement may\\noccur as a result of one of the following pathophysiologicmechanisms:\\nI. Infections\\nII. Disordered immunoregulationIII. Altered splenic blood flow\\nIV. Lymphohaematogenous malignancies\\nV. Diseases with abnormal erythrocytesVI. Storage diseases\\nVII. Miscellaneous causes.\\nBased on these mechanisms, an abbreviated list of causes\\nof splenomegaly is given in Table 14.13.  Most of these\\nconditions have been discussed elsewhere.\\nThe degree of splenomegaly  varies with the disease\\nentity:\\nMild enlargement (upto 5 cm)  occurs in CVC of spleen in\\nCHF, acute malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial endocarditis,\\nSLE, rheumatoid arthritis and thalassaemia minor.\\nModerate enlargement (upto umbilicus)  occurs in hepatitis,\\ncirrhosis, lymphomas, infectious mononucleosis, haemolyticanaemia, splenic abscesses and amyloidosis.\\nMassive enlargement (below umbilicus)  occurs in CML,\\nmyeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis, storage diseases,thalassaemia major, chronic malaria, leishmaniasis and portalvein obstruction.\\nMild to moderate splenomegaly is usually symptomless,\\nwhile a massively enlarged spleen may cause draggingsensation in the left hypochondrium. Spleen becomespalpable only when it is enlarged.\\nGrossly,  an enlarged spleen is heavy and firm. The capsule\\nis tense and thickened. The sectioned surface of the organis firm with prominent trabeculae.\\nMicroscopically,  there is dilatation of sinusoids with\\nprominence of splenic cords. The white pulp is atrophic\\nwhile the trabeculae are thickened. Long-standingcongestion may produce haemorrhages and Gamna-Gandy\\nbodies  resulting in fibrocongestive splenomegaly,  also called\\nBanti’s spleen  ( see Figs. 5.13 and 5.14)\\nHYPERSPLENISM\\nThe term hypersplenism is used for conditions which cause\\nexcessive removal of erythrocytes, granulocytes or plateletsfrom the circulation. The mechanism for excessive removalcould be due to increased sequestration of cells in the spleenby altered splenic blood flow or by production of antibodiesagainst respective blood cells. The criteria for hypersplenismare as under:\\n1.Splenomegaly.\\n2.Splenic destruction of one or more of the cell types in the\\nperipheral blood causing anaemia, leucopenia, thrombo-\\ncytopenia, or pancytopenia.\\n3.\\nBone marrow cellularity is normal or hyperplastic.\\n4. Splenectomy is followed by improvement in the severity\\nof blood cytopenia.EFFECTS OF SPLENECTOMY\\nIn view of the prominent role of normal spleen in seques-\\ntration of blood cells, splenectomy in a normal individualis followed by significant haematologic alterations.Induction of similar haematologic effects is made use in thetreatment of certain pathologic conditions. For example, inautoimmune haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia, therespective blood cell counts are increased followingsplenectomy. The blood changes following splenectomy areas under:\\n1.Red cells:  There is appearance of target cells in the blood\\nfilm. Howell-Jolly bodies are present in the red cells as they\\nare no longer cleared by the spleen. Osmotic fragility testshows increased resistance to haemolysis. There may beappearance of normoblasts.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 14.13: Causes of Splenomegaly.\\nI. INFECTIONS\\n1. Malaria\\n2.\\nLeishmaniasis\\n3. Typhoid4. Infectious mononucleosis5.

There is shift-to-left of the myeloid\\ncells with appearance of some myelocytes.\\n3. Platelets:  Within hours after splenectomy, there is rise in\\nplatelet count upto 3-4 times normal.\\nSPLENIC RUPTURE\\nThe most common cause of splenic rupture or laceration is\\nblunt trauma. The trauma may be direct or indirect. Non-traumatic or spontaneous rupture occurs in an enlargedspleen but almost never in a normal spleen. In acuteinfections, the spleen can enlarge rapidly to 2 to 3 times itsnormal size causing acute splenic enlargement termed acute\\nsplenic tumour  e.g. in pneumonias, septicaemia, acute\\nendocarditis etc. Some of the other common causes ofspontaneous splenic rupture are splenomegaly due to chronicmalaria, infectious mononucleosis, typhoid fever, splenicabscess, thalassaemia and leukaemias.\\nRupture of spleen is an acute surgical emergency due to\\nrapid blood loss and haemoperitoneum. Sometimesfragments of splenic tissue are autotransplanted within theperitoneal cavity and grow into tiny spleens there (splenosis).\\nTUMOURS\\nPrimary tumours  of the spleen are extremely rare. The\\nonly notable benign tumours are haemangiomas andlymphangioma, while examples of primary malignantneoplasms of haematopoietic system i.e. Hodgkin’s diseaseand non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Non-haematopoietictumours of the spleen such as angiosarcoma are rare.\\nSecondary tumours  occur late in the course of disease\\nand represent haematogenous dissemination of themalignant tumour. Splenic metastases appear as multiplenodules. The most frequent primary sites include: lung,breast, prostate, colon and stomach. Rarely, direct extensionfrom an adjacent malignant neoplasm may occur.\\nTHYMUS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe thymus gland is a complex lymphoreticular organ lying\\nburied within the mediastinum. At birth, the gland weighs10-35 gm and grows in size upto puberty, following whichthere is progressive involution in the elderly. In the adult,thymus weighs 5-10 gm.\\nThe gland consists of right and left encapsulated lobes,\\njoined together by fibrous connective tissue. Connectivetissue septa pass inwards from the capsule and subdividethe lobe into large number of lobules. The histologic structureof the lobule shows outer cortex  and inner medulla.  Both cortex\\nand medulla contain two types of cells: epithelial cells andlymphocytes (thymocytes).\\nEpithelial cells are similar throughout the thymus gland.\\nThese cells have elongated cytoplasmic processes formingnetwork in which thymocytes and macrophages are found.Hassall’s corpuscles  are distinctive structures within the\\nmedulla composed of onion skin-like concentrically arrangedepithelial cells having central area of keratinisation.\\nThymocytes  are predominantly present in the cortex.\\nThese cells include immature T lymphocytes in the cortexand mature T lymphocytes in the medulla. Well-developedB-cell lymphoid follicles with germinal centres are rare inthymus gland.\\nThe main  function  of the thymus is in the cell-mediated\\nimmunity by T-cells and by secretion of thymic hormonessuch as thymopoietin and thymosin- α\\n1.\\nThymic lesions are associated with diverse conditions\\nwhich may be immunologic, haematologic or neoplastic.These can be broadly categorised into thymic hypoplasia andagenesis, thymic hyperplasia and  thymoma, while thymicinvolvement in myasthenia gravis is discussed inChapter 28.\\nTHYMIC HYPOPLASIA AND AGENESIS\\nThymic hypoplasia and agenesis are acquired and congenital\\ndisorders respectively in which the gland is either unusuallysmall or absent. These conditions are various types ofhereditary (primary) immunodeficiency diseases such asDiGeorge’s syndrome, severe combined immunodeficiencyand reticular dysgenesis. Acquired hypoplasia occurs as anageing phenomenon or may occur in the young due to severestress, malnutrition, irradiation, therapy with cytotoxic drugsand glucocorticoids.\\nTHYMIC HYPERPLASIA\\nEnlargement of the thymus or failure to involute produces\\nthymic hyperplasia. Hyperplasia is usually associated withappearance of lymphoid follicles in the medulla of the thymusand is called thymic follicular hyperplasia.  Most common cause\\nof follicular hyperplasia of the thymus is myasthenia gravis.Less common causes are: Addison’s disease, Graves’ disease,rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, scleroderma and cirrhosis of liver.\\nTHYMOMA\\nMost common primary tumour present in the anterosuperior\\nmediastinum is thymoma. Although thymus is alymphoepithelial organ, the term thymoma is used for thetumour of epithelial origin. Most of the patients are adults.In about half the cases, thymoma remains asymptomatic andis accidentally discovered in X-rays. Other patients haveassociated conditions like myasthenia gravis or localsymptoms such as cough, dyspnoea and chest pain.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the tumour is\\nspherical, measuring 5-10 cm in diameter with an averageweight of 150 gm. Sectioned surface is soft, yellowish,lobulated and may be either homogeneous or contain cystsdue to the presence of haemorrhage and necrosis.\\nMicroscopically,  the tumour has a thick fibrous capsule\\nfrom which extend collagenous septa into the tumour\\ndividing it into lobules. The histology of lobule shows389CHAPTER 14 Disorders of Leucocytes and Lymphoreticular Tissuesvarious patterns. The tumour consists of neoplastic\\nepithelial cells and variable number of non-neoplasticlymphocytes. Thymoma may be of following types:\\nBenign thymoma is more common. It consists of epithelial\\ncells which are similar to the epithelial cells in the medulla\\nof thymus and hence also called as medullary thymoma.\\nMalignant thymoma is less common and is further of 2\\ntypes:\\nType 1  is cytologically benign looking but aggressive and\\ninvades the mediastinal structures locally.Type 2  is also called thymic carcinoma and has cytologic\\nfeatures of cancer. Further subtypes of epithelial\\nmalignancy may be squamous cell type (most common)and lymphoepithelial type.\\n Thymomas are known for their association with\\nparaneoplastic syndrome. These include: myasthenia gravis(most common), hypogammaglobulinaemia, erythroidhypoplasia (pure red cell aplasia), peripheral T cell leukae-mia/lymphoma, multiple myeloma, other autoimmunedisease associations and other systemic malignancies.\\n❑390SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nThe Blood Vessels\\nand LymphaticsChapter 15Chapter 15\\nSection III SYSTEMIC PATHOLOGY\\nThe blood vessels are closed circuits for the transport of blood\\nfrom the left heart to the metabolising cells, and then back tothe right heart. The blood containing oxygen, nutrients andmetabolites is routed through arteries, arterioles, capillaries,venules and veins. These blood vessels differ from each otherin their structure and function.\\nARTERIES\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nDepending upon the calibre and certain histologic features,\\narteries are divided into 3 types: large (elastic) arteries,medium-sized (muscular) arteries and the smallest arterioles.\\nHistologically,  all the arteries of the body have 3 layers\\nin their walls: the tunica intima, the tunica media and the\\ntunica adventitia. These layers progressively decreasewith diminution in the size of the vessels.\\n1. Tunica intima.  This is the inner coat of the artery. It is\\ncomposed of the lining endothelium, subendothelial\\nconnective tissue and bounded externally by internal elasticlamina.\\nEndothelium  is a layer of flattened cells adjacent to the\\nflowing blood. Narrow junctions exist between the adjoiningendothelial cells through which certain materials pass. Theintegrity of the endothelial layer is of paramount importancein maintenance of vascular functions since damage to it isthe most important event in the initiation of thrombus forma-tion at the site.\\nSubendothelial tissue  consists of loose meshwork of\\nconnective tissue that includes myointimal cells, collagen,proteoglycans, elastin and matrix glycoproteins.\\nInternal elastic lamina  is a layer of elastic fibres having\\nminute fenestrations.\\n2. Tunica media.  Tunica media is the middle coat of the\\narterial wall, bounded internally by internal elastic lamina\\nand externally by external elastic lamina. This layer is thethickest and consists mainly of smooth muscle cells andelastic fibres. The external elastic lamina  consisting of\\ncondensed elastic tissue is less well defined than the internal\\nelastic lamina.3. Tunica adventitia.  The outer coat of arteries is the tunica\\nadventitia. It consists of loose mesh of connective tissue andsome elastic fibres that merge with the adjacent tissues. Thislayer is rich in lymphatics and autonomic nerve fibres.\\nThe layers of arterial wall receive nutrition and oxygen\\nfrom 2 sources:\\n1.Tunica intima and inner third of the media are nourished\\nby direct diffusion  from the blood present in the lumen.\\n2.\\nOuter two-thirds of the media and the adventitia are\\nsupplied by vasa vasora (i.e. vessels of vessels) , the nutrient\\nvessels arising from the parent artery.\\nAs the calibre of the artery decreases, the three layers\\nprogressively diminish. Thus, there are structural variations\\nin the three types of arteries:\\nLarge, elastic arteries  such as the aorta, innominate,\\ncommon carotid, major pulmonary, and common iliacarteries have very high content of elastic tissue in the mediaand thick elastic laminae and hence the name.\\nMedium-sized,  muscular arteries  are the branches of elastic\\narteries. All the three layers of arterial wall are thinner thanin the elastic arteries. The internal elastic lamina appears asa single wavy line while the external elastic lamina is lessprominent. The media primarily consists of smooth musclecells and some elastic fibres (Fig. 15.1).\\nArterioles  are the smallest branches with internal diameter\\n20-100 μm. Structurally, they consist of the three layers as in\\nmuscular arteries but are much thinner and cannot bedistinguished. The arterioles consist of a layer of endothelialcells in the intima, one or two smooth muscle cells in themedia and small amount of collagen and elastic tissuecomprising the adventitia. The elastic laminae are virtuallylost.\\nCapillaries are about the size of an RBC (7-8 μm) and\\nhave a layer of endothelium but no media. Blood fromcapillaries returns to the heart via post-capillary venules  and\\nthence into venules and then veins.\\nIn the following pages, diseases of arteries are discussed\\nunder 3 major headings: arteriosclerosis, arteritis (vasculitis)and aneurysms. This is followed by brief account of diseasesof veins and lymphatics, while the vascular tumours aredescribed at the end of the chapter.391CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and LymphaticsARTERIOSCLEROSIS\\nArteriosclerosis is a general term used to include all condi-\\ntions with thickening and hardening of the arterial walls.The following morphologic entities are included underarteriosclerosis:I. Senile arteriosclerosis\\nII. Hypertensive arteriolosclerosisIII.Mönckeberg’s arteriosclerosis\\n(Medial calcific sclerosis)\\nIV.\\nAtherosclerosis\\nThe last-named, atherosclerosis, is the most common and\\nmost important form of arteriosclerosis; if not specified, thetwo terms are used interchangeably with each other.\\nSENILE ARTERIOSCLEROSIS\\nSenile arteriosclerosis is the thickening of media and intima\\nof the arteries seen due to aging. The changes are non-selective and affect most of  the arteries. These are possiblyinduced by stress and strain on vessel wall during life.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The changes are as under:\\n1.  Fibroelastosis: The intima and media are thickened due\\nto increase in elastic and collagen tissue.\\n2. Elastic reduplication:  The internal elastic lamina is split\\nor reduplicated so that two wavy layers are seen.\\nEventually, the fibrotic changes result in age-related\\nelevation of systolic blood pressure.\\nHYPERTENSIVE ARTERIOLOSCLEROSIS\\nHypertension is the term used to describe an elevation in\\nblood pressure. Pathology of 3 forms of hypertension—systemic, pulmonary and portal, is discussed in detail withdiseases of the kidneys (Chapter 22), lungs (Chapter 17) andliver (Chapter 21) respectively.\\nArteriolosclerosis is the term used to describe 3 morpho-\\nlogic forms of vascular disease affecting arterioles and smallmuscular arteries. These are: hyaline arteriolosclerosis,hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis and necrotising arteriolitis. Allthe three types are common in hypertension but may occurdue to other causes as well.\\nHyaline Arteriolosclerosis\\nHyaline sclerosis is a common arteriolar lesion that may be\\nseen physiologically  due to aging, or may occur pathologically\\nin benign nephrosclerosis in hypertensives and as a part ofmicroangiopathy in diabetics; the subject is discussed againin Chapter 22.\\nMORPHOLOGIC CHANGES.  The visceral arterioles are\\nparticularly involved. The vascular walls are thickenedand the lumina narrowed or even obliterated.\\nMicroscopically,  the thickened vessel wall shows\\nstructureless, eosinophilic, hyaline material in the intima\\nand media (Fig. 15.2,A) .\\nPATHOGENESIS. The exact pathogenesis is not known.\\nHowever, the following hypotheses have been proposed:\\ni)The lesions result most probably from leakage  of compo-\\nnents of plasma  across the vascular endothelium. This is\\nsubstantiated by the demonstration of immunoglobulins,\\ncomplement, fibrin and lipids in the lesions. The permeabilityof the vessel wall is increased, due to haemodyanamic stressin hypertension and metabolic stress in diabetes, so that theseplasma components leak out and get deposited in the vesselwall.\\nii)An alternate possibility is that the lesions may be due to\\nimmunologic reaction .\\niii)\\nSome have considered it to be normal aging  process  that is\\nexaggerated in hypertension and diabetes mellitus.\\nHyperplastic Arteriolosclerosis\\nThe hyperplastic or proliferative type of arteriolosclerosis is\\na characteristic lesion of malignant hypertension; othercauses include haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, sclerodermaand toxaemia of pregnancy.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The morphologic changes\\naffect mainly the intima, especially of the interlobulararteries in the kidneys. Three types of intimal thickeningmay occur.i)Onion-skin lesion  consists of loosely-placed concentric\\nlayers of hyperplastic intimal smooth muscle cells like thebulb of an onion. The basement membrane is alsothickened and reduplicated (Fig. 15.2, B) .\\nii)Mucinous intimal thickening  is the deposition of amor-\\nphous ground substance, probably proteoglycans, withscanty cells.iii)Fibrous intimal thickening  is less common and consists\\nof bundles of collagen, elastic fibres and hyaline depositsin the intima.\\nSevere intimal sclerosis results in narrowed or\\nobliterated lumen. With time, the lesions become moreand more fibrotic.Figure 15.1 The structure of a medium-sized muscular artery.\\n392SECTION III Systemic PathologyPATHOGENESIS.  The pathogenesis of hyperplastic intimal\\nthickening is unclear. Probably, the changes result following\\nendothelial injury from systemic hypertension, hypoxia orimmunologic damage leading to increased permeability. Ahealing reaction occurs in the form of proliferation of smoothmuscle cells with fibrosis.\\nNecrotising Arteriolitis\\nIn cases of severe hypertension and malignant hypertension,\\nparts of small arteries and arterioles show changes of hyalinesclerosis and parts of these show necrosis, or necrosis maybe superimposed on hyaline sclerosis. However, hyalinesclerosis may not be always present in the vessel wall.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Besides the changes of\\nhyaline sclerosis, the changes of necrotising arteriolitisinclude fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall, acuteinflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils in the adventitia.Oedema and haemorrhages often surround the affectedvessels (Fig. 15.2,C).\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Since necrotising arteriolitis occurs in\\nvessels in which there is sudden and great elevation ofpressure, the changes are said to result from direct physicalinjury to the vessel wall.\\nMÖNCKEBERG’S ARTERIOSCLEROSIS\\n(MEDIAL CALCIFIC SCLEROSIS)\\nMönckeberg’s arteriosclerosis is calcification of the media of\\nlarge and medium-sized muscular arteries, especially of theextremities and of the genital tract, in persons past the ageof 50. The condition occurs as an age-related degenerativeprocess, and therefore, an example of dystrophic calcification,and has little or no clinical significance. However, medialcalcification also occurs in some pathological states likepseudoxanthoma elasticum and in idiopathic arterialcalcification of infancy.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Medial calcification is\\noften an incidental finding in X-rays of the affected siteshaving muscular arteries. The deposition of calcium saltsin the media produces pipestem-like rigid tubes withoutcausing narrowing of the lumen.Microscopically,  Mönckeberg’s arteriosclerosis is\\ncharacterised by deposits of calcium salts in the mediawithout associated inflammatory reaction while the intimaand the adventitia are spared (Fig. 15.3) . Often, coexistent\\nchanges of atherosclerosis are present altering thehistologic appearance.\\nPATHOGENESIS. Pathogenesis of this condition is not\\nknown but it is considered as an age-related physiologicchange due to prolonged effect of vasoconstriction.\\nFigure 15.2 Diagrammatic representation of three forms of arteriolosclerosis, commonly seen in hypertension.\\nFigure 15.3 Monckeberg’s arteriosclerosis (medial calcific sclerosis).\\nThere is calcification exclusively in the tunica media unassociated with\\nany significant inflammation.\\n393CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and LymphaticsATHEROSCLEROSIS\\nDefinition\\nAtherosclerosis is a specific form of arteriosclerosis affecting\\nprimarily the intima of large and medium-sized musculararteries and is characterised by fibrofatty plaques oratheromas. The term atherosclerosis is derived from athero-\\n(meaning porridge) referring to the soft lipid-rich materialin the centre of atheroma, and sclerosis  (scarring) referring to\\nconnective tissue in the plaques. Atherosclerosis is thecommonest and the most important of the arterial diseases.Though any large and medium-sized artery may be involvedin atherosclerosis, the most commonly affected are the aorta,the coronary and the cerebral arterial systems. Therefore, themajor clinical syndromes resulting from ischaemia due toatherosclerosis pertain to the heart (angina and myocardialinfarcts or heart attacks ), and the brain (transient cerebral\\nischaemia and cerebral infarcts or strokes ); other sequelae are\\nperipheral vascular disease, aneurysmal dilatation due toweakened arterial wall, chronic ischaemic heart disease,ischaemic encephalopathy and mesenteric arterial occlusion.\\nEtiology\\nAtherosclerosis is widely prevalent in industrialised coun-\\ntries. However, majority of the data on etiology are basedon the animal experimental work and epidemiologicalstudies. The incidences for atherosclerosis quoted in theliterature are based on the major clinical syndromesproduced by it, the most important interpretation being thatdeath from myocardial infarction is related to underlyingatherosclerosis. Cardiovascular disease, mostly related toatherosclerotic coronary heart disease or ischaemic heartdisease (IHD) is the most common cause of premature deathin the developed countries of the world. It is estimated thatby the year 2020, cardiovascular disease, mainlyatherosclerosis, will become the leading cause of total globaldisease burden.\\nSystematic large scale studies of investigations on living\\npopulations have revealed a number of risk factors which are\\nassociated with increased risk of developing clinicalatherosclerosis. Often, they are acting in combination ratherthan singly. These risk factors are divided into two groups\\n(Table 15.1):I.Major risk factors. These are further considered under 2\\nheadings:\\nA) Major risk factors modifiable by life style and/or therapy : This\\nincludes major risk factors which can be controlled by\\nmodifying life style and/or by pharmacotherapy andincludes: dyslipidaemias, hypertension, diabetes mellitusand smoking.\\nB) Constitutional risk factors:  These are non-modifiable major\\nrisk factors that include: increasing  age, male sex, genetic\\nabnormalities, and familial and racial predisposition.\\nII.\\nNon-traditional emerging risk factors.  This includes a\\nhost of factors whose role in atherosclerosis is minimal, and\\nin some cases, even uncertain.\\nApparently, a combination of etiologic risk factors have\\nadditive effect in producing the lesions of atherosclerosis.\\nMAJOR RISK FACTORS MODIFIABLE BY LIFE STYLE\\nAND/OR THERAPY\\nThere are four major risk factors in atherogenesis—lipid\\ndisorders, hypertension, cigarette smoking and diabetesmellitus.\\n1. DYSLIPIDAEMIAS.  Virchow in 19th century first\\nidentified cholesterol crystals in the atherosclerotic lesions.\\nSince then, extensive information on lipoproteins and theirrole in atherosclerotic lesions has been gathered.Abnormalities in plasma lipoproteins have been firmlyestablished as the most important major risk factor foratherosclerosis. It has been firmly established that hyper-cholesterolaemia has directly proportionate relationship withatherosclerosis and IHD. The following evidences are citedin support of this:\\ni) The atherosclerotic plaques contain cholesterol and\\ncholesterol esters, largely derived from the lipoproteins in\\nthe blood.\\ni\\ni) The lesions of atherosclerosis can be induced in\\nexperimental animals by feeding them with diet rich in\\ncholesterol.\\niii) Individuals with hypercholesterolaemia due to various\\ncauses such as in diabetes mellitus, myxoedema, nephroticsyndrome, von Gierke’s disease, xanthomatosis and familialhypercholesterolaemia have increased risk of developingatherosclerosis and IHD.\\niv) Populations having hypercholesterolaemia have higher\\nmortality from IHD. Dietary regulation and administrationof cholesterol-lowering drugs have beneficial effect onreducing the risk of IHD.\\nThe concentration of total cholesterol in the serum reflects\\nthe concentrations of different lipoproteins in the serum. Thelipoproteins are divided into classes according to the densityof solvent in which they remain suspended on centrifugationat high speed. The major classes of lipoprotein particles arechylomicrons, very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-densitylipoproteins (LDL),  and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) . Lipids\\nare insoluble in blood and therefore are carried in circulationand across the cell membrane by carrier proteins calledapoproteins . Apoprotein surrounds the lipid for carrying it,\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 15.1: Risk Factors in Atherosclerosis.\\nI. MAJOR RISK FACTORS  II. EMERGING RISK FACTORS\\nA) Modifiable 1\\n.

Infections ( C.pneumoniae ,\\nHerpesvirus, CMV)\\n10. High CRP394SECTION III Systemic Pathologydifferent apoproteins being named by letter A, B, C, D etc\\nwhile their subfractions are numbered serially.\\nThe major fractions of lipoproteins tested in blood lipid\\nprofile and their varying effects on atherosclerosis and IHDare as under (Table 15.2):\\ni) Total cholesterol:  Desirable normal serum level is\\n140-200 mg/dl, while levels of borderline high are consideredbetween 200-240 mg/dl. An elevation of total serumcholesterol levels above 260 mg/dl in men and womenbetween 30 and 50 years of age has three times higher risk ofdeveloping IHD as compared with people with total serumcholesterol levels within normal limits.\\nii) Triglycerides:  Normal serum level is below 160 mg/dl.\\niii) Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol:  Normal\\noptimal serum level is <130 mg/dl . LDL is richest in\\ncholesterol and has the maximum association  with athero-\\nsclerosis.iv) Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL):  VLDL carries\\nmuch of the triglycerides and its blood levels therefore\\nparallel with that of triglycerides; VLDL has less marked effect\\nthan LDL.\\nv)High-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol:  Normal\\ndesirable serum level is <60 mg/dl. HDL is protective  (‘good\\ncholesterol’) against atherosclerosis.\\nMany studies have demonstrated the harmful effect of\\ndiet containing larger quantities of saturated fats (e.g. in eggs,\\nmeat, milk, butter etc) and trans fats (i.e. unsaturated fatsproduced by artificial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fats)which raise the plasma cholesterol level. This type of diet isconsumed more often by the affluent societies who are atgreater risk of developing atherosclerosis. On the contrary,a diet low in saturated fats and high in poly-unsaturated fatsand having omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. in fish, fish oils etc)lowers the plasma cholesterol levels. Aside from lipid-richdiet, high intake of the total number of calories fromcarbohydrates, proteins, alcohol and sweets has adverseeffects.\\nBesides above, \\nfamilial hypercholesterolaemia , an autosomal\\ncodominant disorder, is characterised by elevated LDLcholesterol and normal triglycerides and occurrence ofxanthomas and premature coronary artery disease. It occursdue to mutations in LDL receptor gene.\\nCurrently, management of dyslipidaemia is directed at\\nlowering LDL  in particular and total cholesterol in general by\\nuse of statins, and for raising HDL  by weight loss, exercise\\nand use of nicotinic acid. Thus presently, preferred term forhyperlipidaemia is dyslipidaemia because one risky plasmalipoprotein (i.e. LDL) is elevated and needs to be broughtdown, while the other good plasma lipoprotein (i.e. HDL)when low requires to be raised.\\nHow hypercholesterolaemia and various classes of\\nlipoproteins produce atherosclerosis is described under‘pathogenesis’.\\n2. HYPERTENSION.  Hypertension is a risk factor for all\\nclinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. Hypertension\\ndoubles the risk of all forms of cardiovascular disease. It actsprobably by mechanical injury to the arterial wall due toincreased blood pressure. Elevation of systolic pressure ofover 160 mmHg or a diastolic pressure of over 95 mmHg isassociated with five times higher risk of developing IHD thanin people with blood pressure within normal range (140/90mmHg or less).\\n3. SMOKING.  The extent and severity of atherosclerosis\\nare much greater in smokers than in non-smokers. Cigarette\\nsmoking is associated with higher risk of atherosclerotic IHDand sudden cardiac death. Men who smoke a pack ofcigarettes a day are 3-5 times more likely to die of IHD thannon-smokers. The increased risk and severity ofatherosclerosis in smokers is due to reduced level of HDL,deranged coagulation system and accumulation of carbonmonoxide in the blood that produces carboxyhaemoglobinand eventually hypoxia in the arterial wall favouringatherosclerosis.\\n4. DIABETES MELLITUS.  Clinical manifestations of\\natherosclerosis are far more common and develop at an early\\nage in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.In particular, association of type 2 diabetes mellituscharacterised by metabolic (insulin resistance) syndrome andabnormal lipid profile  termed ‘diabetic dyslipidaemia’ iscommon and heightens the risk of cardiovascular disease.The risk of developing IHD is doubled, tendency to developcerebrovascular disease is high, and frequency to developgangrene of foot is about 100 times increased. The causes ofincreased severity of atherosclerosis are complex andnumerous which include endothelial dysfunction, increasedaggregation of platelets, increased LDL and decreased HDL.\\nCONSTITUTIONAL RISK FACTORS\\nAge, sex and genetic influences do affect the appearance of\\nlesions of atherosclerosis.\\n1. AGE.  Atherosclerosis is an age-related disease. Though\\nearly lesions of atherosclerosis may be present in childhood,\\nclinically significant lesions are found with increasing age.Fully-developed atheromatous plaques usually appear in the\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 15.2: Fractions of Lipoproteins in Serum.\\nClasses Sites of Synthesis Normal Serum Levels Role in Atherosclerosis\\n1. HDL cholesterol Liver, \\nintestine > 60 mg/dl Protective\\n2. LDL cholesterol Liver < 130 mg/dl Maximum\\n3. VLDL triglycerides Intestine, liver < 160 mg/dl Less marked\\n4. Chylomicrons Liver, intestine, macrophage — Indirect395CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics4th decade and beyond. Evidence in support comes from the\\nhigh death rate from IHD in this age group.\\n2. SEX.  The incidence and severity of atherosclerosis are\\nmore in men than in women and the changes appear a decade\\nearlier in men ( >45 years) than in women ( >55 years). The\\nprevalence of atherosclerotic IHD is about three times higherin men in 4th decade than in women and the difference slowlydeclines with age but remains higher at all ages in men. Thelower incidence of IHD in women, especially inpremenopausal age, is probably due to high levels ofoestrogen and high-density lipoproteins, both of which haveanti-atherogenic influence.\\n3. GENETIC FACTORS.  Genetic factors play a significant\\nrole in atherogenesis. Hereditary genetic derangements of\\nlipoprotein metabolism predispose the individual to highblood lipid level and familial hypercholesterolaemia.\\n4. FAMILIAL AND RACIAL FACTORS:  The familial\\npredisposition to atherosclerosis may be related to other risk\\nfactors like diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipopro-teinaemia. Racial differences too exist; Blacks have generallyless severe atherosclerosis than Whites.\\nEMERGING RISK FACTORS\\nThere are a number of nontraditional newly emerging risk\\nfactors for which the role in the etiology of atherosclerosis isyet not fully supported. These factors are as under:\\n1.Higher incidence of atherosclerosis in developed\\ncountries and low prevalence in underdeveloped countries,\\nsuggesting the role of environmental influences.\\n2.Obesity,  if the person is overweight by 20% or more, is\\nassociated with increased risk.\\n3.\\nUse of exogenous hormones (e.g. oral contraceptives) by\\nwomen or endogenous oestrogen deficiency  (e.g. in post-\\nmenopausal women) has been shown to have an increased\\nrisk of developing myocardial infarction or stroke.\\n4. Physical inactivity and lack of exercise are associated with\\nthe risk of developing atherosclerosis and its complications.5. Stressful life style, termed as ‘type A’ behaviour pattern,\\ncharacterised by aggressiveness, competitive drive,\\nambitiousness and a sense of urgency, is associated withenhanced risk of IHD compared with ‘type B’ behaviour ofrelaxed and happy-go-lucky type.\\n6. Patients with homocystinuria,  an uncommon inborn error\\nof metabolism, have been reported to have early\\natherosclerosis and coronay artery disease.\\n7.  There are some reports which suggest that moderate\\nconsumption of alcohol  has slightly beneficial effect by raising\\nthe level of HDL cholesterol.\\n8. Prothrombotic factors  and elevated fibrinogen levels favour\\nformation of thrombi which is the gravest complication of\\natherosclerosis.\\n9. Role of  infections, particularly of Chlamydia pneumoniae  and\\nviruses such as herpesvirus and cytomegalovirus, has been\\nfound in coronary atherosclerotic lesions by causinginflammation. Possibly, infections may be acting incombination with some other factors.10. Markers of inflammation such as elevated C reactive protein ,\\nan acute phase reactant, correlate with risk of  developingatherosclerosis.\\nPathogenesis\\nAs stated above, atherosclerosis is not caused by a single\\netiologic factor but is a multifactorial process whose exactpathogenesis is still not known. Since the times of Virchow,a number of theories have been proposed.\\nInsudation hypothesis.  The concept hypothesised by\\nVirchow in 1856  that atherosclerosis is a form of cellular\\nproliferation of the intimal cells resulting from increasedimbibing of lipids from the blood came to be called the ‘lipid\\ntheory’.  Modified form of this theory is currently known as\\n‘response to injury hypothesis’  and is now-a-days the most\\nwidely accepted theory.\\nEncrustation hypothesis.  The proposal put forth by\\nRokitansky in  1852  that atheroma represented a form of\\nencrustation on the arterial wall from the components in theblood forming thrombi composed of platelets, fibrin andleucocytes, was named as ‘encrustation theory’  or ‘thrombogenic\\ntheory’.  Since currently it is believed that encrustation or\\nthrombosis is not the sole factor in atherogenesis but thecomponents of thrombus (platelets, fibrin and leucocytes)have a role in atheromatous lesions, this theory has now beenincorporated into the response-to-injury hypothesismentioned above.\\nThough, there is no consensus regarding the origin and\\nprogression of lesion of atherosclerosis, the role of four keyfactors—arterial smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, bloodmonocytes and dyslipidaemia, is accepted by all. However,the areas of disagreement exist in the mechanism andsequence of events involving these factors in initiation,progression and complications of disease. Currently,pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is explained on the basis ofthe following two theories:1.Reaction-to-injury hypothesis , first described in 1973, and\\nmodified in 1986 and 1993 by Ross.2.Monoclonal theory , based on neoplastic proliferation of\\nsmooth muscle cells, postulated by Benditt and Benditt in1973.\\n1. REACTION-TO-INJURY HYPOTHESIS.  This theory is\\nmost widely accepted and incorporates aspects of two older\\nhistorical theories of atherosclerosis—the lipid theory ofVirchow and thrombogenic (encrustation) theory ofRokitansky.\\nThe original response to injury theory  was first described\\nin 1973 according to which the initial event in atherogenesiswas considered to be endothelial injury followed by smoothmuscle cell proliferation so that the early lesions, accordingto this theory, consist of smooth muscle cells mainly.\\nThe modified response-to-injury hypothesis  described sub-\\nsequently in 1993 implicates lipoprotein entry into theintima as the initial event followed by lipid accumulation inthe macrophages (foam cells now) which according tomodified theory, are believed to be the dominant cells in earlylesions.396SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nBoth these theories—original and modified, have attra-\\ncted support and criticism. However, following is the\\ngenerally accepted role of key components involved inatherogenesis, diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 15.4.\\ni) Endothelial injury.  It has been known for many years\\nthat endothelial injury is the initial triggering event in thedevelopment of lesions of atherosclerosis. Actual endothelialdenudation is not an essential requirement, but endothelialdysfunction may initiate the sequence of events. Numerouscauses ascribed to endothelial injury in experimental animalsare: mechanical trauma, haemodynamic forces, immuno-logical and chemical mechanisms, metabolic agent as chronicdyslipidaemia, homocystine, circulating toxins from systemicinfections, viruses, hypoxia, radiation, carbon monoxide andtobacco products.In man, two of the major risk factors which act together\\nto produce endothelial injury are: haemodynamic stress from\\nhypertension and chronic dyslipidaemia.  The role of\\nhaemodynamic forces in causing endothelial injury is furthersupported by the distribution of atheromatous plaques atpoints of bifurcation or branching of blood vessels which areunder greatest shear stress.\\nii) Intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation.  Endothelial\\ninjury causes adherence, aggregation and platelet release\\nreaction at the site of exposed subendothelial connectivetissue and infiltration by inflammatory cells. Proliferation ofintimal smooth muscle cell and production of extracellularmatrix are stimulated by various cytokines such as IL-1 andTNF- α released from invading monocyte-macrophages and\\nby activated platelets at the site of endothelial injury. Thesecytokines lead to local synthesis of following growth factorshaving distinct roles in plaque evolution:\\nPlatelet-derived growth factor  (PDGF)  and fibroblast\\ngrowth factor (FGF)  stimulate proliferation and migration\\nof smooth muscle cells from their usual location in the mediainto the intima.\\nTransforming growth factor- β (TGF -β)  and interferon-\\n(IFN- γ) derived from activated T lymphocytes within lesions\\nregulate the synthesis of collagen by smooth muscle cells.\\nSmooth muscle cell proliferation is also facilitated by\\nbiomolecules such as nitric oxide and endothelin  released from\\nendothelial cells. Intimal proliferation of smooth muscle cellsis accompanied by synthesis of matrix proteins—collagen,elastic fibre proteins and proteoglycans.\\niii)Role of blood monocytes.  Though blood monocytes do\\nnot possess receptors for normal LDL, LDL does appear in\\nthe monocyte cytoplasm to form foam cell by mechanismillustrated in Fig. 15.5.  Plasma LDL on entry into the intima\\nundergoes oxidation. The ‘oxidised LDL’ formed in theintima performs the following all-important functions onmonocytes and endothelium:\\nFor monocytes: Oxidised LDL acts to attract, proliferate,\\nimmobilise and activate them as well as is readily taken upby scavenger receptor on the monocyte to transform it to alipid-laden foam cell.\\nFor endothelium : Oxidised LDL is cytotoxic.\\nDeath of foam cell by apoptosis releases lipid to form\\nlipid core of plaque.\\niv) Role of dyslipidaemia.  As stated already, chronic\\ndyslipidaemia in itself may initiate endothelial injury and\\ndysfunction by causing increased permeability. In particular,hypercholesterolaemia with increased serum concentrationof LDL promotes formation of foam cells, while high serumconcentration of HDL has anti-atherogenic effect.\\nv) Thrombosis.  As apparent from the foregoing, endothelial\\ninjury exposes subendothelial connective tissue resulting in\\nformation of small platelet aggregates at the site and causingproliferation of smooth muscle cells. This causes mildinflammatory reaction which together with foam cells isincorporated into the atheromatous plaque. The lesionsenlarge by attaching fibrin and cells from the blood so thatthrombus becomes a part of atheromatous plaque.Figure 15.4 Diagrammatic representation of pathogenesis of\\natherosclerosis as explained by ‘reaction-to-injury’ hypothesis. A, Endo-\\nthelial injury. B, Adhesion of platelets and migration of blood monocytesfrom blood stream. C, Smooth muscle cell proliferation into the intimaand ingrowth of new blood vessels.\\n397CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and Lymphatics\\n2. MONOCLONAL HYPOTHESIS.  This hypothesis is\\nbased on the postulate that proliferation of smooth muscle\\ncells is the primary event and that this proliferation ismonoclonal in origin similar to cellular proliferation inneoplasms (e.g. in uterine leiomyoma, Chapter 8). Theevidence cited in support of monoclonal hypothesis is theobservation on proliferated smooth muscle cells inatheromatous plaques which have only one of the two formsof glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) isoenzymes,suggesting monoclonality in origin. The monoclonalproliferation of smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis maybe initiated by mutation caused by exogenous chemicals (e.g.cigarette smoke), endogenous metabolites (e.g. lipoproteins)and some viruses (e.g. Marek’s disease virus in chickens,herpesvirus).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURESEarly lesions in the form of diffuse intimal thickening, fattystreaks and gelatinous lesions are often the forerunnersin the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions.  However, theclinical disease states due to luminal narrowing inatherosclerosis are caused by fully developed atheroma-tous plaques and complicated plaques  (Fig. 15.6).\\n1. FATTY STREAKS AND DOTS.  Fatty streaks and\\ndots on the intima by themselves are harmless but maybe the precursor lesions of atheromatous plaques. Theyare seen in all races of the world and begin to appear inthe first year of life. However, they are uncommon in olderpersons and are probably absorbed. They are especiallyprominent in the aorta and other major arteries, more oftenon the posterior wall than the anterior wall.Figure 15.5 Mechanism of foam cell formation.\\nFigure 15.6 Schematic evolution of lesions in atherosclerosis.\\n398SECTION III Systemic PathologyGrossly,  the lesions may appear as flat or slightly elevated\\nand yellow. They may be either in the form of small,\\nmultiple dots, about 1 mm in size, or in the form ofelongated, beaded streaks.Microscopically,  fatty streaks lying under the endo-\\nthelium are composed of closely-packed foam cells, lipid-containing elongated smooth muscle cells and a fewlymphoid cells. Small amount of extracellular lipid,collagen and proteoglycans are also present.\\n2. GELATINOUS LESIONS.  Gelatinous lesions develop\\nin the intima of the aorta and other major arteries in the\\nfirst few months of life. Like fatty streaks, they may alsobe precursors of plaques. They are round or oval,circumscribed grey elevations, about 1 cm in diameter.Microscopically,  gelatinous lesions are foci of increased\\nground substance in the intima with thinned overlyingendothelium.\\n3. ATHEROMATOUS PLAQUES.  A fully developed\\natherosclerotic lesion is called atheromatous plaque, also\\ncalled fibrous plaque, fibrofatty plaque or atheroma.  Unlike\\nfatty streaks, atheromatous plaques are selective indifferent geographic locations and races and are seen inadvanced age. These lesions may develop fromprogression of early lesions of the atherosclerosisdescribed above. Most often and most severely affected is the\\nabdominal aorta,  though smaller lesions may be seen in\\ndescending thoracic aorta and aortic arch. The majorbranches of the aorta around the ostia are often severelyinvolved, especially the iliac, femoral, carotid, coronary,and cerebral arteries.Grossly,  atheromatous plaques are white to yellowish-\\nwhite lesions, varying in diameter from 1-2 cm and raised\\non the surface by a few millimetres to a centimetre inthickness (Fig. 15.7). Cut section of the plaque reveals the\\nluminal surface as a firm, white fibrous cap  and a  central\\ncore composed of yellow to yellow-white, soft, porridge-\\nlike material and hence the name atheroma.Microscopically,  the appearance of plaque varies depen-\\nding upon the age of the lesion. However, the following\\nfeatures are invariably present (Fig. 15.8):\\nSuperficial luminal part of the fibrous cap  is covered\\nby endothelium, and is composed of smooth muscle cells,\\ndense connective tissue and extracellular matrix\\ncontaining proteoglycans and collagen.\\nCellular area  under the fibrous cap is comprised by a\\nmixture of macrophages, foam cells, lymphocytes and a\\nfew smooth muscle cells which may contain lipid.\\nDeeper central soft core  consists of extracellular lipid\\nmaterial, cholesterol clefts, fibrin, necrotic debris and lipid-laden foam cells.\\nIn older and more advanced lesions,  the collagen in the\\nfibrous cap may be dense and hyalinised, smooth musclecells may be atrophic and foam cells are fewer.\\n4. COMPLICATED PLAQUES.  Various pathologic chan-\\nges that occur in fully-developed atheromatous plaques are\\ncalled the complicated lesions. These account for the mostserious harmful effects of atherosclerosis and even death.\\nThese changes include calcification, ulceration, thrombosis,\\nhaemorrhage and aneurysmal dilatation. It is notuncommon to see more than one form of complication in aplaque.Figure 15.7\\n Structure of a fully-developed atheroma. The opened\\nup inner surface of the abdominal aorta shows a variety of atheromatous\\nlesions. While some are raised yellowish-white lesions raised above thesurface, a few have ulcerated surface. Orifices of some of the branchescoming out of the wall are narrowed by the atherosclerotic process.399CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and Lymphaticsi) Calcification.  Calcification occurs more commonly in\\nadvanced atheromatous plaques, especially in the aorta\\nand coronaries. The diseased intima cracks like an egg-shell when the vessel is incised and opened.Microscopically,  the calcium salts are deposited in the\\nvicinity of necrotic area and in the soft lipid pool deep inthe thickened intima (Fig. 15.9) . This form of athero-\\nsclerotic intimal  calcification differs from Mönckeberg’s\\nmedial  calcific arteriosclerosis that affects only the tunica\\nmedia (page 392).\\nii) Ulceration.  The layers covering the soft pultaceous\\nmaterial of an atheroma may ulcerate as a result of\\nhaemodynamic forces or mechanical trauma. This resultsin discharge of emboli composed of lipid material anddebris into the blood stream, leaving a shallow, raggedulcer with yellow lipid debris in the base of the ulcer.Occasionally, atheromatous plaque in a coronary arterymay suddenly rupture into the arterial lumen forcibly andcause thromboembolic occlusion.\\niii)Thrombosis.  The ulcerated plaque and the areas of\\nendothelial damage are vulnerable sites for formation of\\nsuperimposed thrombi. These thrombi may get dislodgedto become emboli and lodge elsewhere in the circulation,or may get organised and incorporated into the arterialwall as mural thrombi. Mural thrombi may becomeocclusive thrombi which may subsequently recanalise.\\niv)\\nHaemorrhage.  Intimal haemorrhage may occur in an\\natheromatous plaque either from the blood in the vascular\\nlumen through an ulcerated plaque, or from rupture ofthin-walled capillaries that vascularise the atheroma fromadventitial vasa vasorum. Haemorrhage is particularly acommon complication in coronary arteries. Thehaematoma formed at the site contains numeroushaemosiderin-laden macrophages.\\nv) Aneurysm formation.  Though atherosclerosis is\\nprimarily an intimal disease, advanced lesions are\\nassociated with secondary changes in the media andadventitia. The changes in media include atrophy andthinning of the media and fragmentation of internal elasticlamina. The adventitia undergoes fibrosis and someinflammatory changes. These changes cause weakeningin the arterial wall resulting in aneurysmal dilatation.\\nClinical Effects\\nThe clinical effects of atherosclerosis depend upon the size\\nand type of arteries affected. In general, the clinical effectsresult from the following:1.Slow luminal narrowing causing ischaemia and atrophy.\\n2. Sudden luminal occlusion causing infarction necrosis.Figure 15.8 Histologic appearance of a fully-developed atheroma.\\nFigure 15.9 Complicated atheromatous plaque lesion. There is\\nnarrowing of the lumen of coronary due to fully developed atheromatous\\nplaque which has dystrophic calcification in its core.\\n400SECTION III Systemic Pathology3. Propagation of plaque by formation of thrombi and\\nemboli.4. Formation of aneurysmal dilatation and eventual rupture.\\nLarge arteries affected most often are the aorta, renal,\\nmesenteric and carotids, whereas the medium- and small-sized arteries frequently involved are the coronaries,cerebrals and arteries of the lower limbs. Accordingly, thesymptomatic atherosclerotic disease involves most often theheart, brain, kidneys, small intestine and lower extremities(Fig. 15.10). The effects pertaining to these organs are\\ndescribed in relevant chapters later while the major effectsare listed below (Fig. 15.11):\\ni)Aorta —Aneurysm formation, thrombosis and\\nembolisation to other organs.ii)Heart —Myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease.\\niii)Brain —Chronic ischaemic brain damage, cerebral\\ninfarction.iv)Small intestine —Ischaemic bowel disease, infarction.\\nv)Lower extremities —Intermittent claudication, gangrene.\\nARTERITIS\\nArteritis, angiitis and vasculitis are the common terms used\\nfor inflammatory process in an artery or an arteriole. It mayoccur following invasion of the vessel by infectious agents,or may be induced by non-infectious injuries such aschemical, mechanical, immunologic and radiation injury. Thenon-infectious group is more important than the infectioustype. A classification of arteritis based on this is given inTable 15.3.\\nI.INFECTIOUS ARTERITIS\\nDirect invasion of the artery by infectious agents, especially\\nbacteria and fungi, causes infectious arteritis. It may be foundin the vicinity of an infected focus like in tuberculosis,pneumonia, abscesses, etc. or less frequently may arise fromhaematogenous spread of infection such as in infectiveendocarditis, septicaemia, etc. Some common types aredescribed below.\\nEndarteritis Obliterans\\nEndarteritis obliterans is not a disease entity but a patho-\\nlogic designation used for non-specific inflammatoryresponse of arteries and arterioles to a variety of irritants. Itis commonly seen close to the lesions of peptic ulcers of the\\nstomach and duodenum, tuberculous and chronic abscesses\\nin the lungs, chronic cutaneous ulcers, chronic meningitis,and in post-partum and post-menopausal uterine arteries.\\nGrossly,  the affected vessels may appear unaltered\\nexternally but on cross-section show obliteration of theirlumina.Microscopically,  the obliteration of the lumen is due to\\nconcentric and symmetric proliferation of cellular fibroustissue in the intima. Though the condition has suffix— itis\\nFigure 15.10 Major sites of atherosclerosis (serially numbered) in\\ndescending order of frequency.\\nFigure 15.11 Major forms of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease.\\n401CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and Lymphaticsattached to it, there is minimal or no inflammatory cell\\ninfiltrate.\\nNon-syphilitic Infective Arteritis\\nVarious forms of invasions of the artery by bacteria, fungi,\\nparasites or viruses, either directly or by haematogenousroute, cause non-syphilitic infective arteritis.\\nMicroscopically,  the inflammatory infiltrate is present in\\nthe vessel wall. The vascular lumen may get occluded bythrombi and result in ischaemic necrosis of the affectedtissue.\\nSyphilitic Arteritis\\nSyphilitic or luetic vascular involvement occurs in all stages\\nof syphilis but is more prominent in the tertiary stage. Thechanges that are found in the syphilitic arteritis are seenwithin the arterial tissue ( syphilitic endarteritis ) and in the\\nperiarterial tissues ( syphilitic periarteritis ). Manifestations of\\nthe disease are particularly prominent at two sites—the aortaand the cerebral arteries.\\nSYPHILITIC AORTITIS.  Syphilitic involvement of the\\nascending aorta and the aortic arch is the commonest\\nmanifestation of cardiovascular syphilis. It occurs in about80% cases of tertiary syphilis. Preferential involvement ofthe arch of aorta may be due to involvement of mediastinallymph nodes in secondary syphilis through which thetreponemes spread to the lymphatics around the aortic arch.The lesions diminish in severity in descending thoracic aortaand disappear completely at the level of the diaphragm.\\nGrossly,  the affected part of the aorta may be dilated, and\\nits wall somewhat thickened and adherent to theneighbouring mediastinal structures. Longitudinallyopened vessels show intimal surface studded with pearly-white thickenings, varying from a few millimeters to acentimeter in diameter. These lesions are separated bywrinkled normal intima, giving it characteristic tree-bark\\nappearance.  Cut section of the lesion shows more firm and\\nfibrous appearance than the atheromatous plaques.However, superimposed atherosclerotic lesions may bepresent.Microscopically,  the conspicuous features are as under\\n(Fig. 15.12):\\nEndarteritis and periarteritis of the vasa vasorum\\nlocated in the media and adventitia.\\nPerivascular accumulation of plasma cells, lympho-\\ncytes and macrophages that may form miliary gummaswhich undergo necrosis and are replaced by scar tissue.\\nIntimal thickenings consist of dense avascular collagen\\nthat may undergo hyalinisation and calcification.\\nThe effects  of syphilitic aortitis may vary from trivial to\\ncatastrophic. These are as follows:\\na)Aortic aneurysm  may result from damage to the aortic wall\\n(page 406).\\nb)Aortic valvular incompetence  used to be considered an\\nimportant sequela of syphilis but now-a-days rheumatic\\ndisease is considered more important cause for this. Theaortic incompetence results from spread of the syphiliticprocess to the aortic valve ring.\\nc)Stenosis of coronary ostia  is seen in about 20% cases of\\nsyphilitic aortitis and may lead to progressive myocardial\\nfibrosis, angina pectoris and sudden death.\\nThe features distinguishing syphilitic aortitis from aortic\\natheroma are given in Table 15.4.\\nCEREBRAL SYPHILITIC ARTERITIS (HEUBNER’SARTERITIS).  Syphilitic involvement of small and medium-\\nsized cerebral arteries occurs during the tertiary syphilis. Thechanges may accompany syphilitic meningitis.\\nGrossly,  the cerebral vessels are white, rigid and thick-\\nwalled.Microscopically,  changes of endarteritis and periarteritis\\nsimilar to those seen in syphilitic aortitis are found. Thereis atrophy of muscle in the media and replacement byfibrosis. This results in ischaemic atrophy of the brain.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 15.3: Classification of Vasculitis.\\nI.

There is perivascular\\ninfiltrate of plasma cells, lymphocytes and macrophages.\\n402SECTION III Systemic Pathologyliver, gastrointestinal tract, muscle, pancreas, testes, nervous\\nsystem and skin. The syndrome of PAN presents with variedsymptoms pertaining to different organs. However, someusual clinical features are fever, malaise, weakness, weightloss, renal manifestations (albuminuria, haematuria and renalfailure), vascular lesions in the alimentary tract (abdominalpain and melaena), peripheral neuritis and hypertension. Thecondition is believed to result from deposition of immunecomplexes and tumour-related antigens.\\nGrossly,  the lesions of PAN involve segments of vessels,\\nespecially at the bifurcations and branchings, as tinybeaded nodules.Microscopically,  there are 3 sequential stages in the\\nevolution of lesions in PAN:\\ni)Acute stage —There is fibrinoid necrosis in the centre\\nof the nodule located in the media. An acute inflammatory\\nresponse develops around the focus of fibrinoid necrosis.The inflammatory infiltrate is present in the entirecircumference of the affected vessel (periarteritis) andconsists chiefly of neutrophils and eosinophils, and somemononuclear cells. The lumen may show thrombi and theweakened wall may be the site of aneurysm formation.\\nii)Healing stage —This is characterised by marked\\nfibroblastic proliferation producing firm nodularity. The\\ninflammatory infiltrate now consists mainly oflymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages.\\niii)Healed stage —In this stage, the affected arterial wall is\\nmarkedly thickened due to dense fibrosis. The internal\\nelastic lamina is fragmented or lost. Healed stage maycontain haemosiderin-laden macrophages and organisedthrombus.\\nHowever, it may be mentioned here that various stages\\nof the disease may be seen in different vessels and evenwithin the same vessel.\\nHypersensitivity Vasculitis\\nHypersensitivity vasculitis, also called as allergic or leuco-\\ncytoclastic vasculitis or microscopic polyarteritis, is a groupof clinical syndromes differing from PAN in havinginflammatory involvement of venules, capillaries andarterioles. The tissues and organs most commonly involvedare the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, brain, heart,II. NON-INFECTIOUS ARTERITIS\\nThis group consists of most of the important forms of\\nvasculitis, more often affecting  arterioles, venules andcapillaries, and hence also termed as small vessel vasculitis .\\nTheir exact etiology is not known but available evidencesuggests that many of them have immunologic origin. Serumfrom many of patients with vasculitis of immunologic originshow the presence of following immunologic features:\\n1. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs).\\nPatients with immunologic vasculitis have autoantibodiesin their serum against the cytoplasmic antigens of theneutrophils, macrophages and endothelial cells; these arecalled ANCAs.  Neutrophil immunofluorescence is used todemonstrate their presence, of which two distinct patternsof ANCAs are seen:\\nCytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA)  pattern  is specific for\\nproteinase-3 (PR-3), a constituent of neutrophilic granules;this is seen in cases with active Wegener’s granulomatosis.\\nPerinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA)  pattern  is specific for\\nmyeloperoxidase enzyme; this is noted in patients withmicroscopic polyarteritis nodosa and primary glomerulardisease.\\n2. Anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECAs).  These\\nantibodies are demonstable in cases of SLE, Kawasaki disease\\nand Buerger’s disease.\\n3. Pauci-immune vasculitis. While most cases of\\nimmunologic vasculitis have immune complex deposits in\\nthe vessel wall, there are some cases which do not have suchimmune deposits and are termed as cases of pauci-immunevasculitis (similar to pauci-immune glomerulonephritis,Chapter 22). Pathogenesis of lesions in these cases isexplained by other mechanisms.\\nPolyarteritis Nodosa\\nPolyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a necrotising vasculitis invol-\\nving small and medium-sized muscular arteries of multipleorgans and tissues. ‘Polyarteritis’ is the preferrednomenclature over ‘periarteritis’ because inflammatoryinvolvement occurs in all the layers of the vessel wall.\\nThe disease occurs more commonly in adult males than\\nfemales. Most commonly affected organs, in descendingorder of frequency of involvement, are the kidneys, heart,\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 15.4: Contrasting Features of Syphilitic Aortitis and Aortic Atheroma.\\nFeature Syphilitic Aortitis Aortic Atheroma\\n1.

Effects Thoracic aortic aneurysm, incompetence Abdominal aortic aneurysm, aortic valve stenosis,\\nof the aortic valve, stenosis of coronary ostia stenosis of abdominal branches403CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and Lymphaticsgastrointestinal tract, kidneys and muscle. The condition\\nresults from immunologic response to an identifiable antigenthat may be bacteria (e.g. streptococci, staphylococci,mycobacteria), viruses (e.g. hepatitis B virus, influenza virus,CMV), malarial parasite, certain drugs and chemicals.Hypersensitivity vasculitis includes clinicopathologic entitiessuch as serum sickness, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, mixedcryoglobulinaemia, vasculitis associated with malignancy,and vasculitis associated with connective tissue diseases likerheumatoid arthritis and SLE.\\nMicroscopically,  the lesions characteristically involve\\nsmallest vessels, sparing medium-sized and largerarteries. Two histologic forms are described:\\ni)Leucocytoclastic vasculitis,  characterised by fibrinoid\\nnecrosis with neutrophilic infiltrate in the vessel wall.\\nMany of the neutrophils are fragmented (Fig. 15.13).  This\\nform is found in vasculitis caused by deposits of immunecomplexes.\\nii)Lymphocytic vasculitis,  in which the involved vessel\\nshows predominant infiltration by lymphocytes. This type\\nis seen in vascular injury due to delayed hypersensitivityor cellular immune reactions.\\nWegener’s Granulomatosis\\nWegener’s granulomatosis is another form of necrotising\\nvasculitis characterised by a clinicopathologic triad  consisting\\nof the following:\\ni)Acute necrotising granulomas of the upper and lower\\nrespiratory tracts involving nose, sinuses and lungs;\\nii)\\nfocal necrotising vasculitis, particularly of the lungs and\\nupper airways; and\\niii) focal or diffuse necrotising glomerulonephritis.\\nA limited form  of Wegener’s granulomatosis is the same\\ncondition without renal involvement. As with PAN, the\\ncondition is more common in adult males and involvesmultiple organs and tissues. Most commonly involvedorgans are the lungs, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx andkidneys. Other involved organs are joints, skin, eyes, ears,heart and nervous system. Accordingly, clinical features arevariable. Typical features include pneumonitis with bilateralinfiltrates in the lungs (Chapter 17), chronic sinusitis, naso-pharyngeal ulcerations (Chapter 18) and renal disease(Chapter 22). The etiology is not known but possibly thelesions occur due to the presence of circulating immunecomplexes. This is supported by the observation ofsubepithelial immunoglobulin deposits on the glomerularbasement membrane and induction of remission by immuno-suppressive therapy. The serum of these patients showsc-ANCA positivity. Disseminated form of Wegener’sgranulomatosis differs from a related entity, idiopathic lethal\\nmidline granuloma,  in the sense that the latter condition is\\nhighly destructive and progressively necrotic disease of theupper airways.\\nHistologically,  the characteristic feature of Wegener’s\\ngranulomatosis is the presence of necrotising granulo-matous inflammation of the tissues and necrotisingvasculitis with or without granulomas:\\nThe granulomas consist of fibrinoid necrosis with\\nextensive infiltration by neutrophils, mononuclear cells,epithelioid cells, multinucleate giant cells and fibroblasticproliferation.\\nThe necrotising vasculitis may be segmental or circum-\\nferential.\\nThe renal lesions are those of focal or diffuse necro-\\ntising glomerulonephritis.\\nTemporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis\\nThis is a form of granulomatous inflammation of medium-\\nsized and large arteries. Preferential sites of involvement arethe cranial arteries, especially the temporal, and hence thename. However, the aorta and other major arteries likecommon carotid, axillary, brachial, femoral and mesentericarteries are also involved, and therefore, it is preferable tocall the entity as ‘giant cell arteritis’ . The patients are generally\\nover the age of 70 years with slight female preponderance.The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blindnessif ophthalmic artery is involved. An association withpolymyalgia rheumatica has been observed. The cause of thecondition remains unknown though there is suggestion of Tcell mediated immunologic reaction to some component ofthe arterial wall, especially against the damaged internalelastic lamina. Biopsy of the affected artery is not only ofdiagnostic value but also relieves the patient of painfulsymptoms.\\nGrossly,  the affected artery is thickened, cord-like and the\\nlumen is usually reduced to a narrow slit.Histologically,  the features include the following:\\ni) There is chronic granulomatous reaction, usually\\naround the internal elastic lamina and typically involvesthe entire circumference of the vessel.ii)Giant cells of foreign body or Langhans’ type are found\\nin two-third of cases.\\nFigure 15.13 Leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The vessel wall shows\\nfibrinoid necrosis surrounded by viable as well as fragmented neutrophils.\\n404SECTION III Systemic Pathologyiii) The internal elastic lamina is often fragmented.\\niv) There is eccentric or concentric intimal cellularproliferation causing marked narrowing of the lumen. Thenarrowed lumen may contain thrombus.v) Occasionally, only nonspecific inflammatory cellinfiltrate consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes andeosinophils is found throughout the arterial wall.\\nTakayasu’s Arteritis (Pulseless Disease)\\nThis is a form of granulomatous vasculitis affecting chiefly\\nthe aorta and its major branches and hence is also referred toas aortic arch syndrome.  The disease affects chiefly young\\nwomen and is typically characterised by absence of pulse inboth arms and presence of ocular manifestations. Otherfeatures referable to ischaemic effects from thromboticocclusion of vessels include myocardial infarction, congestiveheart failure and neurologic deficits. The etiology ofTakayasu’s arteritis is not known but the autoimmunereaction to aortic tissue has been suggested as the possiblecause.\\nGrossly,  the aortic wall is irregularly thickened and intima\\nwrinkled. The branches of major arteries coming off theaortic arch have obliterated lumina.Histologically,  the features are as under:\\ni)There is severe mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate\\ninvolving the full thickness of the affected vessel wall.ii\\n) The inflammatory changes are more severe in the\\nadventitia and media and there is perivascular infiltrationof the vasa vasorum.iii)Granulomatous changes in the media with central\\nnecrosis and Langhans’ giant cells are found in manycases.iv) Advanced lesions show extensive fibrosis of the mediaand adventitia causing thickening in the vessel wall.\\nKawasaki’s Disease\\nAlso known by more descriptive name of ‘ mucocutaneous\\nlymph node syndrome’ , it is an acute and subacute illness\\naffecting mainly young children and infants. Kawasaki’s\\ndisease is a febrile illness with mucocutaneous symptomslike erosions of oral mucosa and conjunctiva, skin rash andlymphadenopathy. The etiology is unknown; possible causesconsidered are infectious, genetic, toxic and immunological.The most characteristic finding is the presence of multipleaneurysms of the coronaries detected by angiography duringlife or observed at autopsy. Other vessels that may beinvolved are renal, mesenteric, hepatic and pancreaticarteries.\\nHistologically,  the picture is of panarteritis resembling\\nPAN, characterised by necrosis and inflammation of theentire thickness of the vessel wall. Therefore, someconsider Kawasaki’s disease as an infantile form of PAN.\\nBuerger’s Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans)\\nBuerger’s disease is a specific disease entity affecting chiefly\\nsmall and medium-sized arteries and veins of the extremitiesand characterised by acute and chronic occlusiveinflammatory involvement. The disease affects chiefly menunder the age of 35 years who are heavy cigarette smokers.The symptom-complex consists of intermittent claudicationdue to ischaemia manifested by intense pain affecting thelimbs, more commonly the legs. Eventually, gangrene of theaffected extremities occurs requiring amputation.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Following possible mechanisms\\nhave been suggested:\\nThere is consistent association with heavy cigarette\\nsmoking. This has led to the hypothesis that tobacco products\\ncause either direct endothelial damage leading to\\nhypercoagulability and thrombosis, or it is a result inhypersensitivity to tobacco products. In support is thedemonstration of anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECAs).\\nGenetic factors  play a role as the disease has familial\\noccurrence and has HLA association. An increasedprevalence is seen in individuals with HLA-A9 and HLA-B5antigens. It is seen more commonly in persons from Israel,Japan and in India.\\nGrossly,  the lesions are typically segmental affecting small\\nand medium-sized arteries, especially of the lowerextremities. Involvement of the arteries is oftenaccompanied with involvement of adjacent veins andnerves. Fibrous tissue cuff generally surrounds these threestructures. Mural thrombi are frequently present in thevessels.\\nMicroscopically,  the following changes are seen in\\ndifferent stages of the disease:\\ni) In early stage,  there is infiltration by polymorphs in all\\nthe layers of vessels and there is invariable presence ofmural or occlusive thrombosis of the lumen (Fig. 15.14).\\nThe appearance differs from atherosclerosis in havingmicroabscesses in the thrombi, proliferation of endothelialcells, lack of lipid aggregates and presence of intactinternal elastic lamina.ii)In\\n advanced stage,  the cellular infiltrate is predomi-\\nnantly mononuclear and may contain an occasionalepithelioid cell granuloma with Langhans’ giant cells. Thethrombi undergo organisation and recanalisation. In morechronic cases, marked fibrosis of the media is present.\\nMiscellaneous Hypersensitivity Vasculitis\\nVarious connective tissue diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis,\\nankylosing spondylitis and SLE), rheumatic fever, certainmalignancies and Henoch-Schönlein purpura are associatedwith vasculitis. The type of vasculitis is generally ofhypersensitivity or allergic angiitis as already explained butsometimes may resemble PAN.\\nRheumatoid vasculitis  affects chiefly the small and\\nmedium-sized arteries of multiple visceral organs in patientswho have rheumatoid nodules of long duration. Vasculitisin SLE affects mainly the small arteries of the skin.\\nRheumatic vasculitis  involves the aorta, carotid and\\ncoronary arteries and the visceral vessels. Usually, fibrinoidchange and perivascular inflammation are seen rather thantypical Aschoff nodules (page 439).405CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and LymphaticsRaynaud’s Disease and Raynaud’s Phenomenon\\nRaynaud’s disease  is not a vasculitis but is a functional\\nvasospastic disorder affecting chiefly small arteries and\\narterioles of the extremities, occurring in otherwise younghealthy females. The disease affects most commonly thefingers and hands. The ischaemic effect is provoked primarilyby cold but other stimuli such as emotions, trauma, hormonesand drugs also play a role. Clinically, the affected digits showpallor,  followed by cyanosis,  and then redness,  corresponding\\nto arterial ischaemia, venostasis  and hyperaemia  respectively.\\nLong-standing cases may develop ulceration and necrosisof digits but occurrence of true gangrene is rare. The causeof the disease is unknown but probably occurs due tovasoconstriction mediated by autonomic stimulation of theaffected vessels. Though usually no pathologic changes areobserved in the affected vessels, long-standing cases mayshow endothelial proliferation and intimal thickening.\\nRaynaud’s phenomenon  differs from Raynaud’s disease in\\nhaving an underlying cause e.g. secondary to arthero-\\nsclerosis, connective tissue diseases like scleroderma andSLE, Buerger’s disease, multiple myeloma, pulmonaryhypertension and ingestion of ergot group of drugs.Raynaud’s phenomenon like Raynaud’s disease, also showscold sensitivity but differs from the latter in having structuralabnormalities in the affected vessels. These changes includesegmental inflammation and fibrinoid change in the wallsof capillaries.ANEURYSMS\\nDEFINITION\\nAn aneurysm is defined as a permanent abnormal dilatation\\nof a blood vessel occurring due to congenital or acquiredweakening or destruction of the vessel wall. Most commonly,aneurysms involve large elastic arteries, especially the aortaand its major branches. Aneurysms can cause various ill-effects such as thrombosis and thromboembolism, alterationin the flow of blood, rupture of the vessel and compressionof neighbouring structures.\\nCLASSIFICATION\\nAneurysms can be classified on the basis of various features:\\nA.Depending upon the composition of the wall:\\n1True aneurysm  composed of all the layers of a normal\\nvessel wall.\\n2.False aneurysm  having fibrous wall and occurring often\\nfrom trauma to the vessel.\\nB. Depending upon the shape: These are as under\\n(Fig. 15.15):\\n1.Saccular  having large spherical outpouching.\\n2.Fusiform  having slow spindle-shaped dilatation.\\n3.Cylindrical  with a continuous parallel dilatation.\\n4.Serpentine or varicose  which has tortuous dilatation of the\\nvessel.Figure 15.14 Buerger’s disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans). There is acute panarteritis. The lumen is occluded by a thrombus containing\\nmicroabscesses.\\nFigure 15.15 Common shapes of aneurysms of various types.\\n406SECTION III Systemic Pathology5.Racemose or circoid  having mass of intercommunicating\\nsmall arteries and veins.\\nC. Based on pathogenetic mechanisms:  This classification\\nis followed most often (Fig. 15.16):\\n1.Atherosclerotic (arteriosclerotic) aneurysms  are the most\\ncommon type.\\n2.Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms  found in the tertiary stage of\\nthe syphilis.3.Dissecting aneurysms (Dissecting haematoma)  in which the\\nblood enters the separated or dissected wall of the vessel.4.Mycotic aneurysms  which result from weakening of the\\narterial wall by microbial infection.5. Berry aneurysms  which are small dilatations especially\\naffecting the circle of Willis in the base of the brain (Chapter\\n30).\\nThe three common types of aortic aneurysms—athero-\\nsclerotic, syphilitic and dissecting, are described below:\\nAtherosclerotic Aneurysms\\nAtherosclerotic aneurysms are the most common form of\\naortic aneurysms. They are seen more commonly in malesand the frequency increases after the age of 50 years whenthe incidence of complicated lesions of advancedatherosclerosis is higher. They are most common in theabdominal aorta, so much so that all forms of aneurysms ofabdominal aorta (fusiform, cylindrical and saccular) shouldbe considered atherosclerotic until proved otherwise. Otherlocations include thoracic aorta (essentially the ascendingpart and arch of aorta), iliac arteries and other large systemicarteries.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Obviously, severe atherosclerotic lesions\\nare the basic problem which cause thinning and destruction\\nof the medial elastic tissue resulting in atrophy andweakening of the wall. Since atherosclerotic lesions are mostcommon and severe in the abdominal aorta, atheroscleroticaneurysms occur most frequently here. In the thoracic aorta,besides atherosclerotic lesions, medial degeneration isanother additional factor implicated in pathogenesis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Atherosclerotic aneu-\\nrysms of the abdominal aorta are most frequently infra-renal, above the bifurcation of the aorta but may extendinto common iliac arteries. They may be of variable sizebut are often larger than 5-6 cm in diameter.Atherosclerotic aneurysm is most frequently fusiform inshape and the lumen of aneurysm often contains muralthrombus.Histologically,  the wall of atherosclerotic aneurysm loses\\nits normal arterial structure. Instead, there is predo-minance of fibrous tissue in the media and adventitia withmild chronic inflammatory reaction. The intima and innerpart of the media show remnants of atheromatous plaquesand mural thrombus.\\nEFFECTS.  The clinical effects of atherosclerotic aneurysms\\nare due to complications. These are as under:\\n1.Rupture.  Rupture of the atherosclerotic aneurysm is the\\nmost serious and fatal complication. The risk of rupture\\ndepends upon the size and duration of the aneurysm andthe blood pressure. Rupture of abdominal aneurysm mayoccur either into the peritoneum or into the retroperitoneumresulting in sudden and massive bleeding. Occasionally,there may be slow progressive leak from the aneurysm. Aruptured aneurysm is more likely to get infected.\\n2. Compression.  The atherosclerotic aneurysm may press\\nupon some adjacent structures such as compression of ureter\\nand erosion on the vertebral bodies.\\n3.\\nArterial occlusion.  Atherosclerotic aneurysms of the\\nabdominal aorta may occlude the inferior mesenteric artery,\\nor there may be development of occlusive thrombosis.However, collateral circulation develops slowly and is nearlyalways sufficient so as not to produce effects of ischaemia.Thromboembolism is rather common in abdominalaneurysms.\\nSyphilitic (Luetic) Aneurysms\\nCardiovascular syphilis occurs in about 10% cases of syphilis.\\nIt causes arteritis—syphilitic aortitis and cerebral arteritis,both of which are already described in this chapter. One ofthe major complications of syphilitic aortitis is syphilitic orluetic aneurysm that develops in the tertiary stage of syphilis.It usually manifests after the age of 50 years and is morecommon in men. The predominant site of involvement is thethoracic aorta, especially in the ascending part and arch ofaorta. It may extend proximally into the aortic valve causingaortic incompetence and may lead to syphilitic heart disease.Less often, it may extend distally to involve abdominal aorta.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  About 40% cases of syphilitic aortitis\\ndevelop syphilitic aneurysms. The process begins from\\ninflammatory infiltrate around the vasa vasorum of theFigure 15.16 Sites of major forms of aneurysms.\\n407CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and Lymphaticsadventitia, followed by endarteritis obliterans. This results\\nin ischaemic injury to the media causing destruction of thesmooth muscle and elastic tissue of the media and scarring.Since syphilitic aortitis involves the proximal aortamaximally, aortic aneurysm is found most frequently in theascending aorta and in the aortic arch.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Syphilitic aneurysms\\noccurring most often in the ascending part and the archof aorta are saccular in shape and usually 3-5 cm indiameter. Less often, they are fusiform or cylindrical. Theintimal surface is wrinkled and shows tree-bark appearance.\\nWhen the aortic valve is involved, there is stretching androlling of the valve-leaflets producing valvularincompetence and left ventricular hypertrophy due tovolume overload. This results in massively enlarged heartcalled ‘cor bovinum’.Histologically,  the features of healed syphilitic aortitis are\\nseen (page 401). The adventitia shows fibrous thickeningwith endarteritis obliterans of vasa vasorum. The fibrousscar tissue may extend into the media and the intima.Rarely, spirochaetes may be demonstrable in syphiliticaneurysm. Often, mural thrombus is found in theaneurysm.\\nEFFECTS.  The clinical manifestations are found much more\\nfrequently in syphilitic aneurysms than in atheroscleroticaneurysms. The effects include the following:\\n1.Rupture.  Syphilitic aneurysm is likely to rupture causing\\nmassive and fatal haemorrhage into the pleural cavity,\\npericardial sac, trachea and oesophagus.\\n2.\\nCompression.  The aneurysm may press on the adjacent\\ntissues and cause symptoms such as on trachea causing\\ndyspnoea, on oesophagus causing dysphagia, on recurrentlaryngeal nerve leading to hoarseness; and erosion ofvertebrae, sternum and ribs due to persistent pressure.\\n3. Cardiac dysfunction.  When the aortic root and valve are\\ninvolved, syphilitic aneurysm produces aortic incompetence\\nand cardiac failure. Narrowing of the coronary ostia mayfurther aggravate cardiac disease.\\nDissecting Aneurysms and Cystic Medial Necrosis\\nThe term dissecting aneurysm is applied for a dissecting\\nhaematoma in which the blood enters the separated(dissected) wall of the vessel and spreads for varying distancelongitudinally. The most common site is the aorta and is anacute catastrophic aortic disease. The condition occurs mostcommonly in men in the age range of 50 to 70 years. Inwomen, dissecting aneurysms may occur during pregnancy.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The pathogenesis of dissecting aneurysm\\nis explained on the basis of weakened aortic media. Various\\nconditions causing weakening in the aortic wall resulting indissection are as under:\\ni)Hypertensive state.  About 90% cases of dissecting\\naneurysm have hypertension which predisposes such\\npatients to degeneration of the media in some questionableway.i\\ni) Non-hypertensive cases.  These are cases in whom there\\nis some local or systemic connective tissue disorder e.g.\\na) Marfan’s syndrome,  an autosomal dominant disease with\\ngenetic defect in fibrillin which is a connective tissue protein\\nrequired for elastic tissue formation.\\nb) Development of cystic medial necrosis of Erdheim,  especially\\nin old age.c)Iatrogenic trauma  during cardiac catheterisation or\\ncoronary bypass surgery.d)Pregnancy,  for some unknown reasons.\\nOnce medial necrosis has occurred, haemodynamic\\nfactors, chiefly hypertension, cause tear in the intima and\\ninitiate the dissecting aneurysms. The media is split at itsweakest point by the inflowing blood. An alternative\\nsuggestion is that the medial haemorrhage from the vasa\\nvasorum occurs first and the intimal tear follows it. Furtherextension of aneurysm occurs due to entry of blood into themedia through the intimal tear.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Dissecting aneurysm\\ndiffers from atherosclerotic and syphilitic aneurysms in\\nhaving no significant dilatation. Therefore, it is currentlyreferred to as ‘dissecting haematoma’.  Dissecting aneurysm\\nclassically begins in the arch of aorta. In 95% of cases, thereis a sharply-incised, transverse or oblique intimal tear, 3-4 cm long, most often located in the ascending part of theaorta. The dissection is seen most characteristicallybetween the outer and middle third of the aortic media sothat the column of blood in the dissection separates theintima and inner two-third of the media  on one side from the\\nouter one-third of the media and the adventitia  on the other.\\nThe dissection extends proximally into the aortic valvering as well as distally into the abdominal aorta\\n(Fig. 15.17) .\\nOccasionally, the dissection may extend into the\\nbranches of aorta like into the arteries of the neck, coro-\\nnaries, renal, mesenteric and iliac arteries. The dissection\\nmay affect the entire circumference of the aortic media or\\na segment of it. In about 10% of dissecting aneurysms, asecond intimal tear is seen in the distal part of thedissection so that the blood enters the false lumen throughthe proximal tear and re-enters the true lumen throughthe distal tear. If the patient survives, the false lumen may\\ndevelop endothelial lining and ‘double-barrel aorta’  is\\nformed.\\nTwo classification schemes  for dissections of thoracic\\naorta and intramural haematoma have been described\\n(Fig. 15.18):I. DeBakey classification.  Depending upon the extent of\\naortic dissection, three types are described:Type I: Comprises 75% of cases; the intimal tear begins inthe ascending aorta but dissection extends distally forsome distance.Type II: Comprises 5% of cases and dissection is limitedto the ascending aorta.\\nType III: Constitutes the remaining 20% cases. In these\\ncases, intimal tear begins in the descending thoracic aorta\\nnear the origin of subclavian artery and dissection extendsdistally.408SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nII. Stanford classification.  Depending upon clinical\\nmanagement, these are divided into 2 types:\\nType A (Proximal dissection): Involves the ascending aortaand includes type I and II of the above scheme becauseclinical management of DeBakey type I and II is notdifferent.Type B (Distal dissection): Limited to descending aortaand sparing the ascending aorta; it corresponds toDeBakey type III.Histologically,  the characteristic features of cystic medial\\nnecrosis are found. These are as under:\\nFocal separation of the fibromuscular and elastic tissue\\nof the media.\\nNumerous cystic spaces in the media containing\\nbasophilic ground substance.\\nFragmentation of the elastic tissue.\\nIncreased fibrosis of the media.\\nEFFECTS.  The classical clinical manifestation of a dissecting\\naneurysm is excruciating tearing pain in the chest movingdownwards. The complications arising from dissectinganeurysms are as under:\\n1. Rupture.  Haemorrhage from rupture of a dissecting\\naneurysm in the ascending aorta results in mortality in 90%\\nof cases. Most often, haemorrhage occurs into thepericardium; less frequently it may rupture into thoraciccavity, abdominal cavity or retroperitoneum.\\n2. Cardiac disease.  Involvement of the aortic valve results\\nin aortic incompetence. Obstruction of coronaries results in\\nischaemia causing fatal myocardial infarction. Rarely,dissecting aneurysm may extend into the cardiac chamber.\\n3.\\nIschaemia.  Obstruction of the branches of aorta by\\ndissection results in ischaemia of the tissue supplied. Thus,\\nthere may be renal infarction, cerebral ischaemia andinfarction of the spinal cord.Figure 15.17 A, Dissecting aneurysm, (Type 1) beginning in the aortic arch and extending distally into the descending thoracic aorta as well  as\\nproximally into the ascending aorta. An intimal tear is seen in the arch. B, The cross section shows dissection typically separating the intima and\\ninner two-thirds of the media on luminal  side, from the oute r one-third of the media and the adventitia. C, The ascending aorta is seen with the heart.\\nThere is an intimal tear in the aortic wall (black arrow) extending proximally upto aortic valve dissecting the media which con tains clotted blood\\n(white arrow)\\nFigure 15.18 Two classification schemes of thoracic aortic\\ndissection: Stanford and DeBakey. Stanford type A involving ascending\\naorta only includes DeBakey’s type I (involving ascending aorta andextending into descending aorta as well) and II (limited to ascendingaorta only), while Stanford type B is limited to descending aortacorresponds to DeBakey type III.\\n409CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and LymphaticsFIBROMUSCULAR DYSPLASIA\\nFibromuscular dysplasia first described in 1976, is a non-\\natherosclerotic and non-inflammatory disease affectingarterial wall, most often renal artery. Though the process mayinvolve intima, media or adventitia, medial fibroplasia is themost common.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the involvement\\nis characteristically segmental—affecting vessel in a bead-like pattern with intervening uninvolved areas.Microscopically,  the beaded areas show collections of\\nsmooth muscle cells and connective tissue. There is oftenrupture and retraction of internal elastic lamina.\\nThe main effects  of renal fibromuscular dysplasia,\\ndepending upon the region of involvement, are renovascularhypertension and changes of renal atrophy.\\nVEINS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe structure of normal veins is basically similar to that of\\narteries. The walls of the veins are thinner, the three tunicae(intima, media and adventitia) are less clearly demarcated,elastic tissue is scanty and not clearly organised into internaland external elastic laminae. The media contains very smallamount of smooth muscle cells with abundant collagen. Allveins, except vena cavae and common iliac veins, have valvesbest developed in veins of the lower limbs. The valves aredelicate folds of intima, located every 1-6 cm, often next tothe point of entry of a tributary vein. They prevent anysignificant retrograde venous blood flow.\\nVARICOSITIES\\nVaricosities are abnormally dilated and tortuous veins. The\\nveins of lower extremities are involved most frequently,called varicose veins.  The veins of other parts of the body\\nwhich are affected are the lower oesophagus ( oesophageal\\nvarices,  Chapter 19), the anal region ( haemorrhoids,  Chapter\\n20) and the spermatic cord ( varicocele,  Chapter 23).\\nVARICOSE  VEINS\\nVaricose veins are permanently dilated and tortuous\\nsuperficial veins of the lower extremities, especially the longsaphenous vein and its tributaries. About 10-12% of thegeneral population develops varicose veins of lower legs,with the peak incidence in 4th and 5th decades of life. Adultfemales are affected more commonly than the males,especially during pregnancy. This is attributed to venousstasis in the lower legs because of compression on the iliacveins by pregnant uterus.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  A number of etiologic and\\npathogenetic factors are involved in causing varicose veins.\\nThese are as follows:\\ni)Familial weakness of vein walls and valves is the most\\ncommon cause.ii)Increased intraluminal pressure due to prolonged upright\\nposture e.g. in nurses, policemen, surgeons etc.iii)Compression of iliac veins e.g. during pregnancy,\\nintravascular thrombosis, growing tumour etc.\\ni\\nv) Hormonal effects on smooth muscle.\\nv) Obesity.\\nvi) Chronic constipation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The affected veins, espe-\\ncially of the lower extremities, are dilated, tortuous,\\nelongated and nodular. Intraluminal thrombosis andvalvular deformities are often found.Histologically,  there is variable fibromuscular thickening\\nof the wall of the veins due to alternate dilatation andhypertrophy. Degeneration of the medial elastic tissuemay occur which may be followed by calcific foci. Muralthrombosis is commonly present which may get organisedand hyalinised leading to irregular intimal thickening.\\nEFFECTS.  Varicose veins of the legs result in venous stasis\\nwhich is followed by congestion, oedema, thrombosis, stasis,dermatitis, cellulitis and ulceration. Secondary infectionresults in chronic varicose ulcers.\\nPHLEBOTHROMBOSIS AND  THROMBOPHLEBITIS\\nThe terms ‘phlebothrombosis’  or thrombus formation in veins,\\nand ‘thrombophlebitis’  or inflammatory changes within the\\nvein wall, are currently used synonymously.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Venous thrombosis that precedes\\nthrombophlebitis is initiated by triad  of changes: endothelial\\ndamage, alteration in the composition of blood and venous\\nstasis. The factors that predispose to these changes are cardiacfailure, malignancy, use of oestrogen-containing compounds,postoperative state and immobility due to various reasons.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The most common\\nlocations for phlebothrombosis and thrombophlebitis arethe deep veins of legs accounting for 90% of cases; it iscommonly termed as deep vein thrombosis  (DVT).  Other\\nlocations are periprostatic venous plexus in males, pelvicveins in the females, and near the foci of infection in theabdominal cavity such as acute appendicitis, peritonitis,acute salpingitis and pelvic abscesses.Grossly,  the affected veins may appear normal or may be\\ndistended and firm. Often, a mural or occlusive thrombusis present.Histologically,  the thrombus that is attached to the vein\\nwall induces inflammatory-reparative response beginningfrom the intima and infiltrating into the thrombi. Theresponse consists of mononuclear inflammatory cells andfibroblastic proliferation. In late stage, thrombus is eitherorganised or resolved leading to a thick-walled fibrousvein.\\nEFFECTS.  The clinical effects due to phlebothrombosis and\\nthrombophlebitis may be local or systemic.\\nLocal effects  are oedema distal to occlusion, heat, swelling,\\ntenderness, redness and pain.410SECTION III Systemic PathologySystemic effects  are more severe and occur due to embolic\\nphenomena, pulmonary thromboembolism being the most\\ncommon and most important. Other systemic manifestationsinclude bacteraemia and septic embolisation to brain,meninges, liver etc.\\nSpecial Types of Phlebothrombosis\\nA few special variants of phlebothrombosis are considered\\nbelow:\\n1. THROMBOPHLEBITIS MIGRANS.  Thrombophlebitis\\nmigrans or migratory thrombophlebitis or Trousseau’s\\nsyndrome is the term used for multiple venous thrombi thatdisappear from one site so as to appear at another site. Thecondition is not a morphologic entity but a clinical one, seenmost often in disseminated visceral cancers (e.g. cancer oflungs, prostate, female reproductive tract, breast, pancreasand gastrointestinal tract) as part of paraneoplastic syndromeand is also found in nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis.\\n2. PHLEGMASIA ALBA DOLENS.  This term meaning\\n‘painful white leg’ refers to extensive swelling of the leg,\\noccurring most frequently due to iliofemoral venousthrombosis. It occurs most often in women during latepregnancy or following delivery when the pregnant uteruscauses pressure on the iliofemoral veins, or after extensivepelvic surgery. Development of pulmonary embolism mayoccur due to involvement of inferior vena cava.\\n3. PHLEGMASIA CERULEA DOLENS.  This term\\nmeaning ‘painful blue leg’ refers to markedly swollen bluish\\nskin with superficial gangrene. It is a serious complicationof massive iliofemoral venous thrombosis and decreasedarterial blood flow.\\n4. SUPERIOR VENA CAVAL SYNDROME.  Superior\\nvena caval syndrome refers to obstruction of the superior\\nvena cava. The obstruction results most often from externalcompression or from thrombosis. Some of the commoncauses of superior vena caval syndrome are malignancy(especially lung cancer and lymphoma), syphilitic aorticaneurysm and tuberculous mediastinitis. Clinical featuresinclude dilated veins of neck and thorax, oedema of the face,neck and upper chest, visual disturbances and disturbedsensorium.\\n5. INFERIOR VENA CAVAL SYNDROME.  Inferior vena\\ncaval syndrome is the obstruction of the inferior vena cava.\\nMost often, obstruction results from thrombosis by extensionfrom iliofemoral veins. Other causes of obstruction areexternal compression and neoplastic invasion. Clinicalfeatures are oedema of lower extremities, dilated leg veinsand collateral venous channels in the lower abdomen\\nLYMPHATICS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nLymphatic capillaries, lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes\\ncomprise the lymphatic system. Lymphatic capillariesresemble blood capillaries, and larger lymphatics areidentical to veins. However, lymphatics lined by a singlelayer of endothelium have thin muscle in their walls than inveins of the same size and the valves are more numerous.Lymphatic capillaries and lymphatics form plexuses aroundtissues and organs. The walls of lymphatic capillaries arepermeable to tissue fluid, proteins and particulate matter.\\nLYMPHANGITIS\\nInflammation of the lymphatics or lymphangitis may be acute\\nor chronic.\\nAcute lymphangitis  occurs in the course of many bacterial\\ninfections. The most common organisms are ( β-haemolytic\\nstreptococci and staphylococci). Acute lymphangitis is often\\nassociated with lymphadenitis.\\nGrossly,  the affected lymphatics are dilated and appear\\nas cutaneous streaks.Microscopically,  the dilated lumen contains acute\\ninflammatory exudate, cell debris and clotted lymph.There is inflammatory infiltration into the perilymphatictissues alongwith hyperaemia and oedema. Acutelymphangitis generally heals completely.\\nChronic lymphangitis  occurs due to persistent and recurrent\\nacute lymphangitis or from chronic infections liketuberculosis, syphilis and actinomycosis.\\nHistologically,  there is permanent obstruction due to\\nfibrosis of affected lymphatics called chroniclymphoedema.\\nLYMPHOEDEMA\\nLymphoedema is swelling of soft tissues due to localised\\nincrease in the quantity of lymph (page 97). It may be primary(idiopathic) or secondary (obstructive).\\nI. PRIMARY (IDIOPATHIC) LYMPHOEDEMA.  Lymph-\\noedema occurring without underlying secondary cause is\\ncalled primary or idiopathic lymphoedema. Its various typesare as under:\\n1.Congenital lymphoedema.  Congenital lymphoedema\\nhas further 2 subtypes—familial hereditary form (Milroy’s\\ndisease) and non-familial (simple) form.\\ni\\n) Milroy’s disease  is a form of congenital and familial\\noedema generally affecting one limb but at times may be\\nmore extensive and involve the eyelids and lips. The diseaseis inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is oftenassociated with other congenital anomalies. The conditionresults from developmental defect of lymphatic channels sothat the affected tissue shows abnormally dilated lymphaticsand the area shows honey-combed appearance. Recurrentinfection of the tissue causes cellulitis and fibrosis oflymphatic vessels.\\nii) Simple congenital lymphoedema  is non-familial form with\\nunknown etiology. It is often associated with Turner’s\\nsyndrome and affects one member of the family. Thepathologic changes are similar to those of Milroy’s disease.\\n2. Lymphoedema praecox.  This is a rare form of lymph-\\noedema affecting chiefly young females. The oedema usually411CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and Lymphaticsbegins in the foot and progresses slowly upwards to involve\\nthe whole extremity. With passage of time, the affected areabecomes rough and the oedema is non-pitting. The etiologyis unknown but probably the condition is related to femalereproductive system because of preponderance in femalesand aggravation during menses.\\nII. SECONDARY (OBSTRUCTIVE) LYMPHOEDEMA.\\nThis is more common form of lymphoedema. Various causesof lymphatic obstruction causing lymphoedema are as under:i)Lymphatic invasion by malignant tumour.\\nii)Surgical removal of lymphatics e.g. in radical\\nmastectomy.iii)\\nPost-irradiation fibrosis.\\niv) Parasitic infestations e.g. in filariasis of lymphaticsproducing elephantiasis.v) Lymphangitis causing scarring and obstruction.\\nObstructive lymphoedema occurs only when the\\nobstruction is widespread as otherwise collaterals develop.The affected area consists of dilatation of lymphatics distalto obstruction with increased interstitial fluid. With passageof time, there is inflammatory scarring and the lymphaticsbecome fibrosed with enlargement of the affected part.Rupture of dilated large lymphatics may result in escape ofmilky chyle into the peritoneum ( chyloperitoneum ), into the\\npleural cavity ( chylothorax ), into pericardial cavity ( chylo-\\npericardium ) and into the urinary tract ( chyluria ).\\nTUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nMajority of benign vascular tumours are malformations orhamartomas. A hamartoma is a tumour-like lesion made upof tissues indigenous to the part but lacks the true growthpotential of true neoplasms. However, there is no clear-cutdistinction between vascular hamartomas and true benigntumours and are often described together. On the other hand,there are true vascular tumours which are of intermediategrade and there are frank malignant tumours.\\nA classification of vascular tumours and tumour-like\\nconditions is given in Table 15.5.A. BENIGN TUMOURS AND HAMART OMAS\\nHaemangioma\\nHaemangiomas are quite common lesions, especially in\\ninfancy and childhood. The most common site is the skin ofthe face. Amongst the various clinical and histologic types,three important forms are described below.\\nCAPILLARY HAEMANGIOMA.  These are the most\\ncommon type. Clinically, they appear as small or large, flat\\nor slightly elevated, red to purple, soft and lobulated lesions,varying in size from a few millimeters to a few centimetersin diameter. They may be present at birth or appear in earlychildhood. Strawberry birthmarks and ‘port-wine mark’ aresome good examples. The common sites are the skin,subcutaneous tissue and mucous membranes of oral cavityand lips. Less common sites are internal visceral organs likeliver, spleen and kidneys.\\nHistologically,  capillary haemangiomas are well-defined\\nbut unencapsulated lobules. These lobules are composedof capillary-sized, thin-walled, blood-filled vessels. Thesevessels are lined by single layer of plump endothelial cellssurrounded by a layer of pericytes. The vessels areseparated by some connective tissue stroma (Fig. 15.19).\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 15.5: Tumours and Tumour-like Lesions of Blood\\nVessels and Lymphatics.\\nA.

There are capillaries lined by plump endothelial cells and containing blood. The intervening\\nstroma consists of scant connective tissue.\\n412SECTION III Systemic PathologyMany of the capillary haemangiomas regress sponta-\\nneously within a few years.\\nCAVERNOUS HAEMANGIOMA.  Cavernous haeman-\\ngiomas are single or multiple, discrete or diffuse, red to blue,\\nsoft and spongy masses. They are often 1 to 2 cm in diameter.\\nThey are most common in the skin (especially of the faceand neck); other sites are mucosa of the oral cavity, stomachand small intestine, and internal visceral organs like the liverand spleen.\\nHistologically,  cavernous haemangiomas are composed\\nof thin-walled cavernous vascular spaces, filled partly orcompletely with blood. The vascular spaces are lined byflattened endothelial cells.\\n They are separated by scanty\\nconnective tissue stroma (Fig. 15.20).\\nCavernous haemangiomas rarely involute spontaneously.\\nGRANULOMA PYOGENICUM.  Granuloma pyogenicum\\nis also referred to as haemangioma of granulation tissue type.\\nTrue to its name, it appears as exophytic, red granulationtissue just like a nodule, commonly on the skin and mucosaof gingiva or oral cavity. Pregnancy tumour or granuloma\\ngravidarum  is a variant occurring on the gingiva during\\npregnancy and regresses after delivery. Granulomapyogenicum often develops following trauma and is usually1 to 2 cm in diameter.\\nHistologically,  it shows proliferating capillaries similar\\nto capillary haemangioma but the capillaries are separatedby abundant oedema and inflammatory infiltrate, thusresembling inflammatory granulation tissue.\\nLymphangioma\\nLymphangiomas are lymphatic counterparts of vascular\\nangiomas. Lymphangiomas are congenital lesions which areclassified as capillary, cavernous and cystic hygroma.Combinations are also often seen.CAPILLARY LYMPHANGIOMA.  It is also called as\\nlymphangioma simplex. It is a small, circumscribed, slightlyelevated lesion measuring 1 to 2 cm in diameter. The commonlocations are the skin of head and neck, axilla and mucousmembranes. Rarely, these may be found in the internalorgans.\\nHistologically,  capillary lymphangioma is composed of\\na network of endothelium-lined, capillary-sized spacescontaining lymph and often separated by lymphoidaggregates.\\nCAVERNOUS LYMPHANGIOMA.  It is more common than\\nthe capillary type. The common sites are in the region of headand neck or axilla. A large cystic variety called cystic hygroma\\noccurs in the neck producing gross deformity in the neck.\\nHistologically,  cavernous lymphangioma consists of large\\ndilated lymphatic spaces lined by flattened endothelialcells and containing lymph. Scanty intervening stromalconnective tissue is present (Fig. 15.21).  These lesions,\\nthough benign, are often difficult to remove due toinfiltration into adjacent tissues.\\nGlomus Tumour (Glomangioma)\\nGlomus tumour is an uncommon true benign tumour arising\\nfrom contractile glomus cells that are present in thearteriovenous shunts (Sucquet-Hoyer anastomosis). Thesetumours are found most often in the dermis of the fingers ortoes under a nail; other sites are mucosa of the stomach andnasal cavity. These lesions are characterised by extreme pain.They may be single or multiple, small, often less than 1 cmin diameter, flat or slightly elevated, red-blue, painfulnodules.\\nHistologically,  the tumours are composed of small blood\\nvessels lined by endothelium and surrounded byaggregates, nests and masses of glomus cells. The glomusFigure 15.20 Cavernous haemangioma of the liver. The vascular spaces are large, dilated, many containing blood, and are lined by flattened\\nendothelial cells. Scanty connective tissue stroma is seen between the cavernous spaces.\\n413CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and Lymphaticscells are round to cuboidal cells with scanty cytoplasm\\n(Fig. 15.22) . The intervening connective tissue stroma\\ncontains some non-myelinated nerve fibres.\\nArteriovenous Malformations\\nAn arteriovenous (AV) malformation is a communication\\nbetween an artery and vein without an intervening capillarybed. It may be congenital or acquired type. Congenital AVmalformations have thick-walled vessels with hyalinisationand calcification. Acquired AV malformations reveal changesmainly in the veins which are dilated and thick-walled.\\nBacillary Angiomatosis and Peliosis Hepatis\\nBacillary angiomatosis is a tumour-like lesion reported in\\nassociation with HIV-AIDS with CD4+ T cell counts below100/ μl. In fact, it is an opportunistic infection with gram-\\nnegative bacilli of Bartonella  genus. Most common site ofinvolvement is the skin and bones while a closely relatedcondition peliosis hepatis is seen in the liver (Chapter 21).\\nGrossly, the lesions on the skin are in the form of variable-\\nsized red papules.Histologically,  lobules of proliferating blood vessels are\\nseen lined by epithelioid endothelial cells having mildatypia. Mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate with nucleardebris of neutrophils is present in these areas.\\nThe condition is treated with antibiotics.\\nB. INTERMEDIATE GRADE TUMOURS\\nHaemangioendothelioma\\nHaemangioendothelioma is a true tumour of endothelial\\ncells, the behaviour of which is intermediate between ahaemangioma and haemangiosarcoma. It is found most oftenin the skin and subcutaneous tissue in relation to medium-Figure 15.21 Cavernous lymphangioma of the tongue. Large cystic spaces lined by the flattened endothelial cells and containing lymph are\\npresent. Stroma shows scattered collection of lymphocytes.\\nFigure 15.22 Glomus tumour. There are blood-filled vascular channels lined by endothelial cells and surrounded by nests and masses of\\nglomus cells.\\n414SECTION III Systemic Pathologysized and large veins. Haemangioblastoma  is the term used\\nfor similar tumour occurring in the cerebellum (Chapter 30).\\nGrossly,  the tumour is usually well-defined, grey-red,\\npolypoid mass.\\nMicroscopically,  there is active proliferation of endothelial\\ncells forming several layers around the blood vessels sothat vascular lumina are difficult to identify. These cellsmay have variable mitotic activity. Reticulin staindelineates the pattern of cell proliferation inner to thebasement membrane (Fig. 15.23).\\nC. MALIGNANT  TUMOURS\\nHaemangiopericytoma\\nHaemangiopericytoma is an uncommon tumour arising from\\npericytes. Pericytes are cells present external to the endo-thelial cells of capillaries and venules. This is a rare tumourthat can occur at any site and at any age and may vary insize from 1 to 8 cm.\\nMicroscopically,  the tumour is composed of capillaries\\nsurrounded by spindle-shaped pericytes outside thevascular basement membrane forming whorledarrangement. These tumour cells may have high mitoticrate and areas of necrosis. Silver impregnation stain (i.e.reticulin stain) is employed to confirm the presence ofpericytes outside the basement membrane of capillariesand to distinguish it from haemangioendothelioma(Fig. 15.24).\\nLocal recurrences are common and distant spread occurs\\nin about 20% of cases.\\nAngiosarcoma\\nAlso known as haemangiosarcoma and malignant\\nhaemangioendothelioma, it is a malignant vascular tumouroccurring most frequently in the skin, subcutaneous tissue,liver, spleen, bone, lung and retroperitoneal tissues. It canoccur in both sexes and at any age. Hepatic angiosarcomas  are\\nof special interest in view of their association withcarcinogens like polyvinyl chloride, arsenical pesticides andradioactive contrast medium, thorotrast, used in the past.\\nGrossly,  the tumours are usually bulky, pale grey-white,\\nfirm masses with poorly-defined margins. Areas ofhaemorrhage, necrosis and central softening are frequentlypresent.Microscopically,  the tumours may be well-differentiated\\nmasses of proliferating endothelial cells around well-formed vascular channels, to poorly-differentiated lesionscomposed of plump, anaplastic and pleomorphic cells insolid clusters with poorly identifiable vascular channels(Fig. 15.25) .\\nThese tumours invade locally and frequently have distant\\nmetastases in the lungs and other organs. Lymphangiosarcoma\\nis a histologically similar tumour occurring in obstructive\\nlymphoedema of long duration.\\nKaposi’s Sarcoma\\nKaposi’s sarcoma is a malignant angiomatous tumour, first\\ndescribed by Kaposi, Hungarian dermatologist, in 1872.\\nHowever, the tumour has attracted greater attention in thelast two decades due to its frequent occurrence in patientswith HIV/AIDS.\\nCLASSIFICATION.  Presently, four forms of Kaposi’s\\nsarcoma are described:\\n1.Classic (European) Kaposi’s sarcoma.  This is the form\\nwhich was first described by Kaposi. It is more common in\\nmen over 60 years of age of  Eastern European descent. The\\ndisease is slow growing and appears as multiple, small,\\npurple, dome-shaped nodules or plaques in the skin,Figure 15.23 Haemangioendothelioma nose. A, The vascular\\nchannels are lined by multiple layers of plump endothelial cells having\\nminimal mitotic activity obliterating the lumina. B, Reticulin stain showscondensation of reticulin around the vessel wall but not between theproliferating cells.Figure 15.24\\nHaemangiopericytoma liver. Spindled cells surround\\nthe vascular lumina in a whorled fashion, highlighted by reticulin stain.These tumour cells have bland nuclei and few mitoses.\\n415CHAPTER 15 The Blood Vessels and Lymphaticsespecially on the legs. Involvement of visceral organs occurs\\nin about 10% cases after many years.\\n2. African (Endemic) Kaposi’s sarcoma.  This form is\\ncommon in equatorial Africa. It is so common in Uganda\\nthat it comprises 9% of all malignant tumours in men. It isfound in younger age, especially in boys and in young menand has a more aggressive course than the classic form. Thedisease begins in the skin but grows rapidly to involve othertissues, especially lymph nodes and the gut.\\n3. Epidemic (AIDS-associated) Kaposi’s sarcoma.  This\\nform is seen in about 30% cases of AIDS, especially in young\\nmale homosexuals than the other high-risk groups. Thecutaneous lesions are not localised to lower legs but are moreextensively distributed involving mucous membranes,lymph nodes and internal organs early in the course ofdisease.\\n4. Kaposi’s sarcoma in renal transplant cases.  This form is\\nassociated with recipients of renal transplants who have been\\nadministered immunosuppressive therapy for a long time.The lesions may be localised to the skin or may havewidespread systemic involvement.Figure 15.25 Angiosarcoma spleen.

C, These tumour cells show positive staining for en dothelial marker,\\nCD34.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Pathogenesis of Kaposi’s sarcoma is\\ncomplex. It is an opportunistic neoplasm in immunosup-pressed patients which has excessive proliferation of spindlecells of vascular origin having features of both endotheliumand smooth muscle cells:\\nEpidemiological studies have suggested a viral  association\\nimplicating HIV and human herpesvirus 8 (HSV 8, also calledKaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus or KSHV).\\nOccurrence of Kaposi’s sarcoma involves interplay of\\nHIV-1 infection, HHV-8 infection, activation of the immunesystem and secretion of cytokines (IL-6, TNF- α, GM-CSF,\\nbasic fibroblast factor, and oncostain M). Higher incidenceof Kaposi’s sarcoma in male homosexuals is explained byincreased secretion of cytokines by their activated immunesystem.\\nDefective immunoregulation plays a role in its\\npathogenesis is further substantiated by observation of second\\nmalignancy  (e.g. leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma) in\\nabout one-third of patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Pathologically, all forms\\nof Kaposi’s sarcoma are similar\\nFigure 15.26 Kaposi’s sarcoma in late nodular stage. There a re slit-like blood-filled vascular spaces. Between them are present bands of\\nplump spindle-shaped tumour cells.\\n416SECTION III Systemic PathologyGrossly,  the lesions in the skin, gut and other organs form\\nprominent, irregular, purple, dome-shaped plaques or\\nnodules.\\nHistologically,  the changes are nonspecific in the early\\npatch stage  and more characteristic in the late nodular stage.\\nEarly patch stage:  There are irregular vascular spaces\\nseparated by interstitial inflammatory cells and\\nextravasated blood and haemosiderin.\\nLate nodular stage:  There are slit-like vascular spaces\\ncontaining red blood cells and separated by spindle-shaped, plump tumour cells. These spindle-shapedtumour cells are probably of endothelial origin (Fig. 15.26).\\nCLINICAL COURSE.  The clinical course and biologic\\nbehaviour of Kaposi’s sarcoma is quite variable. The classicform of Kaposi’s sarcoma is largely confined to skin and thecourse is generally slow and insidious with long survival.The endemic (African) and epidemic (AIDS-associated)Kaposi’s sarcoma, on the other hand, has a rapidlyprogressive course, often with widespread cutaneous as wellas visceral involvement, and high mortality.\\n❑417CHAPTER 16 The HeartNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.  The heart is a muscular\\npump that ejects blood into the vascular tree with sufficient\\npressure to maintain optimal circulation. Average weight ofthe heart in an adult male is 300-350 gm while that of anadult female is 250-300 gm. Heart is divided into fourchambers: a right and a left atrium both lying superiorly,and a right and a left ventricle both lying inferiorly and arelarger. The atria are separated by a thin interatrial partitioncalled interatrial septum , while the ventricles are separated\\nby thick muscular partition called interventricular septum.  The\\nthickness of the right ventricular wall is 0.3 to 0.5 cm whilethat of the left ventricular wall is 1.3 to 1.5 cm. The blood inthe heart chambers moves in a carefully prescribed pathway:venous blood from systemic circulation → right atrium →\\nright ventricle → pulmonary arteries → lungs → pulmonary\\nveins → left atrium → left ventricle → aorta → systemic\\narterial supply (Fig. 16.1).\\nThe transport of blood is regulated by cardiac valves: two\\nloose flap-like atrioventricular valves, tricuspid on the rightand mitral (bicuspid) on the left; and two semilunar valveswith three leaflets each, the pulmonary and aortic valves,guarding the outflow tracts. The normal circumference ofthe valvular openings measures about 12 cm in tricuspid,8.5 cm in pulmonary, 10 cm in mitral and 7.5 cm in aortic\\nvalve.Wall of the heart consists mainly of the myocardium  which\\nis covered externally by thin membrane, the epicardium  or\\nvisceral pericardium, and lined internally by another thinlayer, the endocardium.\\nThe myocardium  is the muscle tissue of the heart\\ncomposed of syncytium of branching and anastomosing,transversely striated muscle fibres arranged in parallelfashion. The space between myocardial fibres contains a richcapillary network and loose connective tissue. Themyocardial fibres are connected to each other by irregularjoints called as intercalated  discs. They represent apposed cell\\nmembranes of individual cells which act as tight junctionsfor free transport of ions and action potentials. The cardiacmyocyte is very rich in mitochondria which is the source oflarge amount of ATP required for cardiac contraction. Thecardiac muscle fibre has abundant sarcoplasmic reticulumcorresponding to endoplasmic reticulum of other cells. Trans-verse lines divide each fibre into sarcomeres  which act as\\nstructural and functional subunits. Each sarcomere consistsof prominent central dark A-band  attributed to thick myosin\\nfilaments and flanked on either side by light I-bands  consisting\\nof thin actin filament. The actin bands are in the form oftwisted rods overlying protein molecules called tropomyosin .\\nThese protein molecules are of 3 types: troponin-I, troponin-\\nT, and troponin-C.  Troponin molecules respond to calcium\\nions in cyclical contraction-relaxation of myocardial fibres.Myocardial fibres are terminally differentiated cells and donot regenerate but there is recent evidence that new cardiacmyocytes can be formed from stem cells recruited from thecirculation.\\nThe conduction  system  of the heart located in the myocar-\\ndium is responsible for regulating rate and rhythm of theheart. It is composed of specialised Purkinje fibres whichcontain some contractile myofilaments and conduct actionpotentials rapidly. The conduction system consists of 4 majorcomponents:\\n1.The sinoatrial (SA) node  is located in the posterior wall of\\nthe right atrium adjacent to the point at which the superior\\nvena cava enters the heart. It is also called cardiac pacemakersince it is responsible for determining the rate of contractionfor all cardiac muscle.\\n2\\n. The atrioventricular (AV) bundle  conducts the impulse\\nfrom the SA node to the AV node.3. The atrioventricular (AV) node  is located on the top of the\\ninterventricular septum and receives impulses from the SA\\nnode via AV bundle and transmits them to the bundle ofHis.\\n4. The bundle of His  extends through the interventricular\\nseptum and divides into right and left bundle branches\\nwhich arborise in the respective ventricular walls. These\\nThe Heart Chapter 16Chapter 16\\nFigure 16.1 The normal structure of the heart.\\n418SECTION III Systemic Pathologyfibres transmit impulses from the AV node to the ventricular\\nwalls.\\nThe pericardium  consists of a closely apposed layer,\\nvisceral pericardium or epicardium,  and an outer fibrous sac,\\nthe parietal pericardium . The two layers enclose a narrow\\npericardial cavity which is lined by mesothelial cells andnormally contains 10-30 ml of clear, watery serous fluid. Thisfluid functions as lubricant and shock absorbant to the heart.\\nThe endocardium  is the smooth shiny inner lining of the\\nmyocardium that covers all the cardiac chambers, the cardiacvalves, the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles. Itis lined by endothelium with connective tissue and elasticfibres in its deeper part.\\nThe valve cusps and semilunar leaflets  are delicate and\\ntranslucent structures. The valves are strengthened bycollagen and elastic tissue and covered by a layer ofendothelium (valvular endocardium).\\nMYOCARDIAL BLOOD SUPPLY.  The cardiac muscle, in\\norder to function properly, must receive adequate supply of\\noxygen and nutrients. Blood is transported to myocardialcells by the coronary arteries which originate immediatelyabove the aortic semilunar valve. Most of blood flow to themyocardium occurs during diastole. There are three majorcoronary trunks, each supplying blood to specific segmentsof the heart (Fig. 16.2):\\n1. The anterior descending branch of the left coronary\\nartery  supplies most of the apex of the heart, the anterior\\nsurface of the left ventricle, the adjacent third of the anteriorwall of the right ventricle, and the anterior two-third of theinterventricular septum.\\n2. The circumflex branch of the left coronary artery\\nsupplies the left atrium and a small portion of the lateral\\naspect of the left ventricle.\\n3.\\nThe right coronary artery  supplies the right atrium, the\\nremainder of the anterior surface of the right ventricle, theadjacent half of the posterior wall of the left ventricle and\\nthe posterior third of the interventricular septum.\\nThere are 3 anatomic patterns of distribution of the\\ncoronary blood supply, depending upon which of thecoronary arteries crosses the crux. Crux  is the region on the\\nposterior surface of the heart where all the four cardiacchambers and the interatrial and interventricular septa meet.These patterns are as under:\\nRight coronary artery preponderance  is the most\\ncommon pattern. In this, right coronary artery supplies bloodto the whole of right ventricle, the posterior half of theinterventricular septum and a part of the posterior wall ofthe left ventricle by crossing the crux.\\nBalanced cardiac circulation  is the next most frequent\\npattern. In this, the right and left ventricles receive bloodsupply entirely from right and left coronary arteriesrespectively. The posterior part of the interventricular septumis supplied by a branch of the right coronary while theanterior part is supplied by a branch of the left coronaryartery.\\nLeft coronary preponderance  is the least frequent pattern.\\nIn this, the left coronary artery supplies blood to the entireleft ventricle, whole of interventricular septum and alsosupplies blood to a part of the posterior wall of the rightventricle by crossing the crux.\\nCoronary veins run parallel to the major coronary arteries\\nto collect blood after the cellular needs of the heart are met.Subsequently, these veins drain into the coronary sinus .\\nPATTERNS AND CLASSIFICATION OF\\nHEART DISEASES\\nFor the purpose of pathologic discussion of heart diseases,they are categorised on the basis of anatomic region involved\\nand the functional impairment . Accordingly, topics on heart\\ndiseases are discussed in this chapter under the followingheadings:1. Heart failure2. Congenital heart diseases3. Ischaemic heart disease4. Hypertensive heart disease5. Cor pulmonale6. Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease7. Non-rheumatic endocarditis8. Valvular diseases and deformities9. Myocardial disease10. Pericardial disease11. Tumours of the heart12. Pathology of cardiovascular interventions.\\nIt may be mentioned here that pattern of heart diseases\\nin developing and developed countries is distinct due todifference in living standards. In children, valvular diseasesare common all over the world, but in developing countriesincluding India, infections , particularly rheumatic valvular\\ndisease, is the dominant cause compared to congenital\\netiology in affluent countries. On the other hand, ischaemicheart disease and hypertensive cardiomyopathy are themajor heart diseases in adults in western populations.\\nFigure 16.2 Distribution of blood supply to the heart.\\n419CHAPTER 16 The HeartHEART FAILURE\\nDefinition\\nHeart failure is defined as the pathophysiologic state in which\\nimpaired cardiac function is unable to maintain an adequatecirculation for the metabolic needs of the tissues of the body.It may be acute  or chronic . The term congestive heart failure\\n(CHF) is used for the chronic form of heart failure in whichthe patient has evidence of congestion of peripheralcirculation and of lungs (Chapter 5). CHF is the end-resultof various forms of serious heart diseases.\\nEtiology\\nHeart failure may be caused by one of the following factors,\\neither singly or in combination:\\n1. INTRINSIC PUMP FAILURE.  The most common and\\nmost important cause of heart failure is weakening of the\\nventricular muscle due to disease so that the heart fails toact as an efficient pump. The various diseases which mayculminate in pump failure by this mechanisms are as under:i)Ischaemic heart disease\\nii\\n) Myocarditis\\niii) Cardiomyopathiesiv) Metabolic disorders e.g. beriberiv) Disorders of the rhythm e.g. atrial fibrillation and flutter.\\n2. INCREASED WORKLOAD ON THE HEART.\\nIncreased mechanical load on the heart results in increasedmyocardial demand resulting in myocardial failure.Increased load on the heart may be in the form of pressureload or volume load.\\ni)Increased pressure load  may occur in the following\\nstates:\\na\\n) Systemic and pulmonary arterial hypertension.\\nb) Valvular disease e.g. mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis,pulmonary stenosis.c) Chronic lung diseases.\\nii) Increased volume load  occurs when a ventricle is\\nrequired to eject more than normal volume of the blood\\nresulting in cardiac failure. This is seen in the followingconditions:a) Valvular insufficiencyb) Severe anaemiac) Thyrotoxicosisd) Arteriovenous shuntse) Hypoxia due to lung diseases.\\n3. IMPAIRED FILLING OF CARDIAC CHAMBERS.\\nDecreased cardiac output and cardiac failure may result fromextra-cardiac causes or defect in filling of the heart:a)Cardiac tamponade e.g. haemopericardium, hydroperi-\\ncardiumb\\n) Constrictive pericarditis.\\nTypes of Heart Failure\\nHeart failure may be acute or chronic, right-sided or left-\\nsided, and forward or backward failure.ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEART FAILURE.  Depending\\nupon whether the heart failure develops rapidly or slowly,it may be acute or chronic.\\nAcute heart failure.  Sudden and rapid development of heart\\nfailure occurs in the following conditions:\\ni)Larger myocardial infarction\\nii\\n) Valve rupture\\niii) Cardiac tamponadeiv) Massive pulmonary embolismv) Acute viral myocarditisvi) Acute bacterial toxaemia.\\nIn acute heart failure, there is sudden reduction in cardiac\\noutput resulting in systemic hypotension but oedema doesnot occur. Instead, a state of cardiogenic shock and cerebralhypoxia develops.\\nChronic heart failure.  More often, heart failure develops\\nslowly as observed in the following states:\\ni) Myocardial ischaemia from atherosclerotic coronaryartery diseaseii) Multivalvular heart diseaseiii) Systemic arterial hypertensioniv) Chronic lung diseases resulting in hypoxia and pulmo-nary arterial hypertensionv) Progression of acute into chronic failure.\\nIn chronic heart failure, compensatory mechanisms like\\ntachycardia, cardiac dilatation and cardiac hypertrophy tryto make adjustments so as to maintain adequate cardiacoutput. This often results in well-maintained arterial pressureand there is accumulation of oedema.\\nLEFT-SIDED AND RIGHT-SIDED HEART FAILURE.\\nThough heart as an organ eventually fails as a whole, butfunctionally, the left and right heart act as independent units.From clinical point of view, therefore, it is helpful to considerfailure of the left and right heart separately. The clinicalmanifestations of heart failure result from accumulation ofexcess fluid upstream  to the left or right cardiac chamber\\nwhichever is initially affected (Fig. 16.3):\\nLeft-sided heart failure.  It is initiated by stress to the left\\nheart. The major causes are as follows:i)Systemic hypertension\\nii\\n) Mitral or aortic valve disease (stenosis)\\niii) Ischaemic heart diseaseiv) Myocardial diseases e.g. cardiomyopathies, myocarditis.v) Restrictive pericarditis.\\nThe clinical manifestations of left-sided heart failure result\\nfrom decreased left ventricular output and hence there isaccumulation of fluid upstream  in the lungs. Accordingly, the\\nmajor pathologic changes are as under:i) Pulmonary congestion and oedema causes dyspnoea andorthopnoea (Chapter 5).ii) Decreased left ventricular output causing hypoperfusionand diminished oxygenation of tissues e.g. in kidneys causingischaemic acute tubular necrosis (Chapter 22), in braincausing hypoxic encephalopathy (Chapter 30), and in skeletalmuscles causing muscular weakness and fatigue.\\nRight-sided heart failure.  Right-sided heart failure occurs\\nmore often as a consequence of left-sided heart failure.420SECTION III Systemic PathologyHowever, some conditions affect the right ventricle primarily,\\nproducing right-sided heart failure. These are as follows:i) As a consequence of left ventricular failure.ii) Cor pulmonale in which right heart failure occurs due tointrinsic lung diseases (Chapter 17).iii) Pulmonary or tricuspid valvular disease.iv) Pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonarythromboembolism.v) Myocardial disease affecting right heart.vi) Congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunt.\\nWhatever be the underlying cause, the clinical\\nmanifestations of right-sided heart failure are upstream  of the\\nright heart such as systemic (due to caval blood) and portalvenous congestion, and reduced cardiac output. Accordingly,the pathologic changes are as under:i) Systemic venous congestion in different tissues andorgans e.g. subcutaneous oedema on dependent parts,passive congestion of the liver, spleen, and kidneys (Chapter5), ascites, hydrothorax, congestion of leg veins and neckveins.ii) Reduced cardiac output resulting in circulatorystagnation causing anoxia, cyanosis and coldness ofextremities.\\nIn summary, in early stage the left heart failure mani-\\nfests with features of pulmonary congestion and decreasedleft ventricular output, while the right heart failure presentswith systemic venous congestion and involvement of the liverand spleen. CHF, however, combines the features of bothleft and right heart failure.\\nBACKWARD AND FORWARD HEART FAILURE.  The\\nmechanism of clinical manifestations resulting from heartfailure can be explained on the basis of mutually inter-\\ndependent backward and forward failure.\\nBackward heart failure.  According to this concept, either of\\nthe ventricles fails to eject blood normally, resulting in rise\\nof end-diastolic volume in the ventricle and increase involume and pressure in the atrium which is transmittedbackward  producing elevated pressure in the veins.\\nForward heart failure.  According to this hypothesis, clinical\\nmanifestations result directly from failure of the heart topump blood causing diminished flow of blood to the tissues,especially diminished renal perfusion and activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\\nCOMPENSATORY MECHANISMS:\\nCARDIAC HYPERTROPHY AND DILAT A\\nTION\\nIn order to maintain normal cardiac output, severalcompensatory mechanisms play a role as under:\\nCompensatory enlargement in the form of cardiac\\nhypertrophy, cardiac dilatation , or both.\\nTachycardia  (i.e. increased heart rate) due to activation of\\nneurohumoral system e.g. release of norepinephrine andatrial natrouretic peptide, activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism.\\nAccording to Starling’s law on pathophysiology of heart,\\nthe failing dilated heart, in order to maintain cardiacperformance, increases the myocardial contractility andthereby attempts to maintain stroke volume. This is achievedby increasing the length of sarcomeres in dilated heart.Ultimately, however, dilatation decreases the force ofcontraction and leads to residual volume in the cardiacFigure 16.3 Schematic evolution of congestive heart failure and its effects.\\n421CHAPTER 16 The Heartchambers causing volume overload resulting in cardiac\\nfailure that ends in death (Fig. 16.4).\\nCardiac Hypertrophy\\nHypertrophy of the heart is defined as an increase in size\\nand weight of the myocardium. It generally results fromincreased pressure load while increased volume load (e.g.valvular incompetence) results in hypertrophy withdilatation of the affected chamber due to regurgitation of theblood through incompetent valve. The atria may alsoundergo compensatory changes due to increased workload.\\nThe basic factors that stimulate the hypertrophy of the\\nmyocardial fibres are not known. It appears that stretchingof myocardial fibres in response to stress induces the cells toincrease in length. The elongated fibres receive betternutrition and thus increase in size. Other factors which maystimulate increase in size of myocardial fibres are anoxia (e.g.in coronary atherosclerosis) and influence of certainhormones (e.g. catecholamines, pituitary growth hormone).\\nCAUSES.  Hypertrophy with or without dilatation may\\ninvolve predominantly the left or the right heart, or both\\nsides.\\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy.  The common causes  are as\\nunder:\\ni)Systemic hypertension\\nii)\\nAortic stenosis and insufficiency\\niii) Mitral insufficiencyiv) Coarctation of the aortav) Occlusive coronary artery diseasevi) Congenital anomalies like septal defects and patentductus arteriosusvii) Conditions with increased cardiac output e.g. thyro-\\ntoxicosis, anaemia, arteriovenous fistulae.Right ventricular hypertrophy.  Most of the causes of right\\nventricular hypertrophy are due to pulmonary arterialhypertension. These are as follows:i) Pulmonary stenosis and insufficiencyii) Tricuspid insufficiencyiii) Mitral stenosis and/or insufficiencyiv) Chronic lung diseases e.g. chronic emphysema,bronchiectasis, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary vascular diseaseetc.v) Left ventricular hypertrophy and failure of the leftventricle.\\nCardiac Dilatation\\nQuite often, hypertrophy of the heart is accompanied by\\ncardiac dilatation. Stress leading to accumulation of excessivevolume of blood in a chamber of the heart causes increase inleng th of myocardial fibres and hence cardiac dilatation as a\\ncompensatory mechanism.\\nCAUSES.  Accumulation of excessive volume of blood within\\nthe cardiac chambers from the following causes may result\\nin dilatation of the respective ventricles or both:i)Valvular insufficiency (mitral and/or aortic insufficiency\\nin left ventricular dilatation, tricuspid and/or pulmonaryinsufficiency in right ventricular dilatation)ii\\n) Left-to-right shunts e.g. in VSD\\niii) Conditions with high cardiac output e.g. thyrotoxicosis,arteriovenous shuntiv) Myocardial diseases e.g. cardiomyopathies, myocarditisv) Systemic hypertension.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Hypertrophy of the myo-\\ncardium without dilatation is referred to as concentric, andwhen associated with dilatation is called eccentricFigure 16.4 Schematic pathophysiology of compensatory mechanisms in cardiac failure.\\n422SECTION III Systemic Pathology(Fig. 16.5).  The weight of the heart is increased above\\nnormal, often over 500 gm. However, excessive epicar-\\ndial fat is not indicative of true hypertrophy.\\nGrossly,  Thickness of the left ventricular wall (excluding\\ntrabeculae carneae and papillary muscles) above 15 mm\\nis indicative of significant hypertrophy. In concentrichypertrophy, the lumen of the chamber is smaller thanusual, while in eccentric hypertrophy the lumen is dilated(Fig. 16.6).  In pure hypertrophy, the papillary muscles and\\ntrabeculae carneae are rounded and enlarged, while inhypertrophy with dilatation these are flattened.\\nMicroscopically,  there is increase in size of individual\\nmuscle fibres. There may be multiple minute foci of\\ndegenerative changes and necrosis in the hypertrophiedmyocardium (Fig. 16.7).  These changes appear to arise as\\na result of relative hypoxia of the hypertrophied muscleas the blood supply is inadequate to meet the demands ofthe increased fibre size. Ventricular hypertrophy rendersthe inner part of the myocardium more liable to ischaemia.\\nElectron microscopy  reveals increase in the number of\\nmyofilaments comprising myofibrils, mitochondrial\\nchanges and multiple intercalated discs which are activesites for the formation of new sarcomeres. Besides, thenucleic acid content determinations have shown increasein total RNA and increased ratio of RNA to DNA contentof the hypertrophied myocardial fibres.\\nCONGENITAL HEART DISEASE\\nCongenital heart disease is the abnormality of the heartpresent from birth. It is the most common and importantform of heart disease in the early years of life and is presentin about 0.5% of newborn children. The incidence is higherin premature infants. The cause of congenital heart diseaseis unknown in majority of cases. It is attributed to multi-factorial inheritance involving genetic and environmentalinfluences. Other factors like rubella infection to the motherduring pregnancy, drugs taken by the mother and heavyalcohol drinking by the mother, have all been implicated incausing in utero  foetal injury resulting in congenital\\nmalformations of the heart.\\nCLASSIFICATION.  Congenital anomalies of the heart may\\nbe either shunts  (left-to-right or right-to-left), or defects\\ncausing obstructions  to flow. However, complex anomaliesFigure 16.5 Schematic diagram showing transverse section through the ventricles with left ventricular hypertrophy (concentric and eccentric ).\\nFigure 16.6 A, Concentric cardiac hypertrophy.  Weight of the heart is increased. The chambers opened up at the apex show concentric\\nthickening of left ventricular wall (white arrow) with obliterated lumen (hypertrophy without dilatation). B, Eccentic cardiac hypertrophy.   The heart\\nis heavier. The free left ventricular wall is thickened (black arrow) while the lumen is dilated (white arrow) (hypertrophy wit h dilatation).\\n423CHAPTER 16 The Heartinvolving combinations  of shunts and obstructions are also\\noften present.\\nA simple classification of important and common exam-\\nples of these groups is given in Table 16.1.\\nI.  MALPOSITIONS OF THE HEART\\nDextrocardia  is the condition when the apex of the heart points\\nto the right side of the chest. It may be accompanied by situs\\ninversus so that all other organs of the body are alsotransposed in similar way and thus heart is in normal positionin relation to them. However, isolated dextrocardia isassociated with major anomalies of the heart such astransposition of the atria in relation to ventricles ortransposition of the great arteries.II.  SHUNTS (CY\\nANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE)\\nA shunt may be left-to-right side or right-to-left side of the\\ncirculation.\\nA. Left-to-Right Shunts\\n(Acyanotic or Late Cyanotic Group)\\nIn conditions where there is shunting of blood from left-to-\\nright side of the heart, there is volume overload on the rightheart producing pulmonary hypertension and rightventricular hypertrophy. At a later stage, the pressure onthe right side is higher than on the left side creating latecyanotic heart disease. The important conditions included\\nin this category are described below:\\nVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT (VSD).  VSD is the most\\ncommon congenital anomaly of the heart and comprises\\nabout 30% of all congenital heart diseases. The condition isrecognised early in life. The smaller defects often closespontaneously, while larger defects remain patent and\\nproduce significant effects.\\nDepending upon the location of the defect, VSD may be\\nof the following types:\\n1.In 90% of cases, the defect involves membranous septum\\nand is very close to the bundle of His (Fig. 16.8).\\n2. The remaining 10% cases have VSD immediately below\\nthe pulmonary valve ( subpulmonic ), below the aortic valve\\n(subaortic ), or exist in the form of multiple defects in the\\nmuscular septum.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The effects  of VSD are\\nproduced due to left-to-right shunt at the ventricular level,\\nincreased pulmonary flow and increased volume in theleft side of the heart. These effects are as under:i) Volume hypertrophy of the right ventricle.\\nii\\n) Enlargement and haemodynamic changes in the\\ntricuspid and pulmonary valves.iii) Endocardial hypertrophy of the right ventricle.\\niv) Pressure hypertrophy of the right atrium.v) Volume hypertrophy of the left atrium and leftventricle.vi)  Enlargement and haemodynamic changes in the mitral\\nand aortic valves.\\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD).  Isolated ASD comprises\\nabout 10% of congenital heart diseases. The condition\\nremains unnoticed in infancy and childhood till pulmonaryhypertension is induced causing late cyanotic heart disease\\nand right-sided heart failure.\\nDepending upon the location of the defect, there are\\n3 types of ASD:\\ni) Fossa ovalis type or ostium secundum type  is the most\\ncommon form comprising about 90% cases of ASD. The\\ndefect is situated in the region of the fossa ovalis (Fig. 16.9).\\nii\\n) Ostium primum type  comprises about 5% cases of ASD.\\nThe defect lies low in the interatrial septum adjacent to\\natrioventricular valves. There may be cleft in the aortic leaflet\\nof the mitral valve producing mitral insufficiency.\\niii)Sinus venosus type  accounts for about 5% cases of ASD.\\nThe defect is located high in the interatrial septum near the\\nentry of the superior vena cava.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 16.1: Classification of Congenital Heart Diseases.\\nI.

Individual myocardial fibres are\\nthick with prominent vesicular nuclei.\\n424SECTION III Systemic PathologyMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The  effects  of ASD are\\nproduced due to left-to-right shunt at the atrial level with\\nincreased pulmonary flow. These effects are as follows:\\ni) Volume hypertrophy of the right atrium and right\\nventricle.ii) Enlargement and haemodynamic changes of tricuspidand pulmonary valves.\\niii) Focal or diffuse endocardial hypertrophy of the right\\natrium and right ventricle.iv) Volume atrophy of the left atrium and left ventricle.v) Small-sized mitral and aortic orifices.PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS (PDA).  The ductus\\narteriosus is a normal vascular connection between the aorta\\nand the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery. Normally, theductus closes functionally within the first or second day oflife. Its persistence after 3 months of age is consideredabnormal. The cause for patency of ductus arteriosus is notknown but possibly it is due to continued synthesis of PGE\\n2\\nafter birth which keeps it patent as evidenced by associationof PDA with respiratory distress syndrome in infants andpharmacologic closure of PDA with administration of indo-methacin to suppress PGE\\n2 synthesis. PDA constitutes about\\n10% of congenital malformations of the heart and greatvessels. In about 90% of cases, it occurs as an isolated defect,while in the remaining cases it may be associated with otheranomalies like VSD, coarctation of aorta and pulmonary oraortic stenosis. A patent ductus may be upto 2 cm in lengthand upto 1 cm in diameter (Fig. 16.10).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The effects  of PDA on heart\\noccur due to left-to-right shunt at the level of ductusresulting in increased pulmonary flow and increasedvolume in the left heart. These effects are as follows:i) Volume hypertrophy of the left atrium and left\\nventricle.ii)Enlargement and haemodynamic changes of the mitral\\nand pulmonary valves.iii)Enlargement of the ascending aorta.\\nB.\\nRight-to-Left Shunts (Cyanotic Group)\\nIn conditions where there is shunting of blood from rightside to the left side of the heart, there is entry of poorly-oxygenated blood into systemic circulation resulting in earlycyanosis. The examples described below are not pure shuntsbut are combinations of shunts wi th obstructions but are\\nFigure 16.8 Ventricular septal defect.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most\\ncommon cyanotic congenital heart disease, found in about\\n10% of children with anomalies of the heart.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The four features of\\ntetralogy are as under (Fig. 16.11):\\ni) Ventricular septal defect (VSD) (‘shunt’) .\\nii)Displacement of the aorta to right so that it overrides\\nthe VSD.iii)Pulmonary stenosis (‘obstruction’) .\\niv) Right ventricular hypertrophy.The severity of the clinical manifestations is related to\\ntwo factors: extent of pulmonary stenosis and the size of VSD.Accordingly, there are two forms of tetralogy: cyanotic andacyanotic:\\na) Cyanotic tetralogy:  Pulmonary stenosis is greater and the\\nVSD is mild so that there is more resistance to the outflow of\\nblood from right ventricle resulting in right-to-left shunt atthe ventricular level and cyanosis. The effects  on the heart\\nare as follows:i)\\nPressure hypertrophy of the right atrium and right\\nventricle.ii) Smaller and abnormal tricuspid valve.iii) Smaller left atrium and left ventricle.iv) Enlarged aortic orifice.\\nb) Acyanotic tetralogy:   The VSD is larger and pulmonary\\nstenosis is mild so that there is mainly left-to-right shunt with\\nincreased pulmonary flow and increased volume in the leftheart but no cyanosis. The effects  on the heart are as under:\\ni) Pressure hypertrophy of the right ventricle and rightatrium.ii) Volume hypertrophy of the left atrium and left ventricle.iii) Enlargement of mitral and aortic orifices.\\nTRANSPOSITION OF GREAT ARTERIES.  The term\\ntransposition is used for complex malformations as regards\\nposition of the aorta, pulmonary trunk, atrioventricularorifices and the position of atria in relation to ventricles.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  There are several forms of\\ntranspositions. The common ones are described below:i)Regular transposition  is the most common type. In this,\\nthe aorta which is normally situated to the right andposterior with respect to the pulmonary trunk, is insteaddisplaced anteriorly and to right. In regular completetransposition, the aorta emerges from the right ventricleand the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle so thatthere is cyanosis from birth.ii)Corrected transposition  is an uncommon anomaly.\\nThere is complete transposition of the great arteries withaorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonarytrunk from the left ventricle, as well as transposition of thegreat veins so that the pulmonary veins enter the rightatrium and the systemic veins drain into the left atrium.This results in a physiologically corrected circulation.\\nPERSISTENT TRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS.  Persistent\\ntruncus arteriosus (PTA) is a rare anomaly.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.   In PTA, the arch that\\nnormally separates the aorta from the pulmonary arteryfails to develop. This results in a single large commonvessel receiving blood from the right as well as leftventricle. The orifice may have 3 to 6 cusps. There is oftenan associated VSD. There is left-to-right shunt andfrequently early systemic cyanosis. The prognosis isgenerally poor.\\nTRICUSPID ATRESIA AND STENOSIS.  Tricuspid atresia\\nand stenosis are rare anomalies. There is often associatedpulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia.Figure 16.10 Patent ductus arteriosus, a schematic representation\\n(LA = Left atrium; LV = Left ventricle; PT = Pulmonary trunk; PV =\\nPulmonary vein, AO = Aorta; RA = Right atrium; RV = Right ventricle;SVC = Superior vena cava; IVC = Inferior vena cava).\\nFigure 16.11\\nTetralogy of Fallot, a schematic representation (LA =\\nLeft atrium; LV = Left ventricle; PT = Pulmonary trunk; PV = Pulmonary\\nvein; AO = Aorta; RA = Right atrium; RV = Right ventricle; SVC = Supe-rior vena cava; IVC = Inferior vena cava).\\n426SECTION III Systemic PathologyMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  In tricuspid atresia, there\\nis absence of tricuspid orifice and instead there is a dimple\\nin the floor of the right atrium. In tricuspid stenosis, thetricuspid ring is small and the valve cusps are malformed.In both the conditions, there is often an interatrial defectthrough which right-to-left shunt of blood takes place.Children are cyanotic since birth and live for a few weeksor months.\\nIII. OBSTRUCTIONS\\n(OBSTRUCTIVE CONGENIT AL HEART DISEASE)\\nCongenital obstruction to blood flow may result fromobstruction in the aorta due to narrowing ( coarctation of aorta ),\\nobstruction to outflow from the left ventricle ( aortic stenosis\\nand atresia ), and obstruction to outflow from the right\\nventricle ( pulmonary stenosis and atresia ).\\nCOARCTATION OF AORTA.  The word ‘coarctation’\\nmeans contracted or compressed. Coarctation of aorta islocalised narrowing in any part of aorta, but the constrictionis more often just distal to ductus arteriosus ( postductal or\\nadult ), or occasionally proximal to the ductus arteriosus\\n(preductal or infantile type ) in the region of transverse aorta:\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The two common forms of\\ncoarrctation of the aorta are as under:\\ni) Postductal or adult type:  The obstruction is just distal\\nto the point of entry of ductus arteriosus which is often\\nclosed (Fig. 16.12). In the stenotic segment, the aorta is\\ndrawn in as if a suture has been tied around it. The aortais dilated on either side of the constriction. The conditionis recognised in adulthood, characterised by hypertensionin the upper extremities, weak pulses and low bloodpressure in the lower extremities and effects of arterialinsufficiency such as claudication and coldness. In time,there is development of collateral circulation between pre-stenotic and post-stenotic arterial branches so thatintercostal arteries are enlarged and palpable and mayproduce erosions on the inner surface of the ribs.\\nii) Preductal or infantile type:  The manifestations are\\nproduced early in life. The narrowing is proximal to the\\nductus arteriosus which usually remains patent. Thenarrowing is generally gradual and involves largersegment of the proximal aorta. There is often associatedinteratrial septal defect. Preductal coarctation results inright ventricular hypertrophy while the left ventricle issmall. Cyanosis develops in the lower half of the bodywhile the upper half remains unaffected since it is supp-lied by vessels originating proximal to the coarctation.Children with this defect have poor prognosis.\\nAORTIC STENOSIS AND ATRESIA.  The most common\\ncongenital anomaly of the aorta is bicuspid aortic valve whichdoes not have much functional significance but predisposesit to calcification (page 450). Congenital aortic atresia is rareand incompatible with survival. Aortic stenosis may beacquired (e.g. in rheumatic heart disease, calcific aorticstenosis) or congenital.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Congenital aortic stenosis\\nmay be of three types: valvular, subvalvular andsupravalvular.i) Valvular stenosis:  The aortic valve cusps are\\nmalformed and are irregularly thickened. The aortic valvemay have one, two or three such maldeveloped cusps.ii)Subvalvular stenosis:  There is thick fibrous ring under\\nthe aortic valve causing subaortic stenosis.iii)Supravalvular stenosis:  The most uncommon type,\\nthere is fibrous constriction above the sinuses of Valsalva.\\nIn all these cases, there is pressure hypertrophy of the\\nleft ventricle and left atrium, and dilatation of the aortic root.\\nPULMONARY STENOSIS AND ATRESIA. Isolated\\npulmonary stenosis and atresia do not cause cyanosis and\\nhence are included under acyanotic heart diseases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The changes in these\\nconditions are as under:\\nPulmonary stenosis:  It is the commonest form of\\nobstructive congenital heart disease comprising about 7%\\nof all congenital heart diseases. It may occur as a compo-nent of tetralogy of Fallot or as an isolated defect.Pulmonary stenosis is caused by fusion of cusps of thepulmonary valve forming a diaphragm-like obstruction tothe outflow of blood from the right ventricle and dilatationof the pulmonary trunk.\\nPulmonary atresia:\\n There is no communication between\\nthe right ventricle and lungs so that the blood bypasses\\nthe right ventricle through an interatrial septal defect. Itthen enters the lungs via patent ductus arteriosus.Figure 16.12 Postductal or adult type coarctation of the aorta, a\\nschematic representation (LA = Left atrium; LV = Left ventricle; PT =\\nPulmonary trunk; PV = Pulmonary vein; AO = Aorta; RA = Right atrium;\\nRV = Right ventricle; SVC = Superior vena cava; IVC = Inferior venacava).\\n427CHAPTER 16 The HeartISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE\\nIschaemic heart disease (IHD)  is defined as acute or chronic\\nform of cardiac disability arising from imbalance between\\nthe myocardial supply and demand for oxygenated blood.Since narrowing or obstruction of the coronary arterialsystem is the most common cause of myocardial anoxia, thealternate term ‘coronary artery disease (CAD)’  is used\\nsynonymously with IHD. IHD or CAD is the leading causeof death in most developed countries (about one-third of alldeaths) and somewhat low incidence is observed in thedeveloping countries. Men develop IHD earlier than womenand death rates are also slightly higher for men than forwomen until the menopause. As per rising trends of IHDworldwide, it is estimated that by the year 2020 it wouldbecome the most common cause of death throughout world.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS\\nIHD is invariably caused by disease affecting the coronary\\narteries, the most prevalent being atherosclerosis accountingfor more than 90% cases, while other causes are responsiblefor less than 10% cases of IHD. Therefore, it is convenient toconsider the etiology of IHD under three broad headings:i)coronary atherosclerosis;\\nii)\\nsuperadded changes in coronary atherosclerosis; and\\niii) non-atherosclerotic causes.\\nI. Coronary Atherosclerosis\\nCoronary atherosclerosis resulting in ‘fixed’ obstruction is\\nthe major cause of IHD in more than 90% cases. The generalaspects of atherosclerosis as regards its etiology, pathogenesisand the morphologic features of atherosclerotic lesions havealready been dealt with at length in the preceding Chapter15. Here, a brief account of the specific features in pathologyof lesions in atherosclerotic coronary artery disease  in particular\\nare presented.\\n1. Distribution.  Atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries\\nare distributed in one or more of the three major coronary\\narterial trunks, the highest incidence being in the anteriordescending branch of the left coronary, followed indecreasing frequency, by the right coronary artery and stillless in circumflex branch of the left coronary. About one-third of cases have single-vessel disease , most often left anterior\\ndescending arterial involvement; another one-third have two-\\nvessel disease, and the remainder have three major vessel disease.\\n2. Location.  Almost all adults show atherosclerotic plaques\\nscattered throughout the coronary arterial system. However,significant stenotic lesions that may produce chronicmyocardial ischaemia show more than 75% (three-fourth)reduction in the cross-sectional area of a coronary artery orits branch. The area of severest involvement is about 3 to 4cm from the coronary ostia, more often at or near the bifurca-tion of the arteries, suggesting the role of haemodynamicforces in atherogenesis.\\n3. Fixed atherosclerotic plaques.  The atherosclerotic\\nplaques in the coronaries are more often eccentrically located\\nbulging into the lumen from one side  (Fig. 16.13).  Occa-sionally, there may be concentric thickening of the wall ofthe artery. Atherosclerosis produces gradual luminalnarrowing that may eventually lead to ‘fixed’ coronaryobstruction. The general features of atheromas of coronaryarteries are similar to those affecting elsewhere in the bodyand may develop similar complications like calcification,coronary thrombosis, ulceration, haemorrhage, rupture andaneurysm formation.\\nII. Superadded Changes in  Coronary Atherosclerosis\\nThe attacks of acute coronary syndromes,  which include acute\\nmyocardial infarction, unstable angina and sudden ischaemic\\ndeath, are precipitated by certain changes superimposed ona pre-existing fixed coronary atheromatous plaque. Thesechanges are as under:\\n1. Acute changes in chronic atheromatous plaque.  Though\\nchronic fixed obstructions are the most frequent cause of IHD,\\nacute coronary episodes are often precipitated by suddenchanges in chronic plaques such as plaque haemorrhage,fissuring, or ulceration that results in thrombosis andembolisation of atheromatous debris. Acute plaque changesare brought about by factors such as sudden coronary arteryspasm, tachycardia, intraplaque haemorrhage and hyper-cholesterolaemia.\\n2. Coronary artery thrombosis.  Transmural acute myocar-\\ndial infarction is often precipitated by partial or complete\\ncoronary thrombosis. The initiation of thrombus occurs dueto surface ulceration of fixed chronic atheromatous plaque,ultimately causing complete luminal occlusion. The lipid coreof plaque, in particular, is highly thrombogenic. Smallfragments of thrombotic material are then dislodged whichare embolised to terminal coronary branches and causemicroinfarcts of the myocardium.Figure 16.13 Left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery\\nshowing critical narrowing with  eccentric luminal obliteration due to\\ncomplicated atheromatous plaque.\\n428SECTION III Systemic Pathology3. Local platelet aggregation and coronary artery spasm.\\nSome cases of acute coronary episodes are caused by localaggregates of platelets on the atheromatous plaque, short offorming a thrombus. The aggregated platelets releasevasospasmic mediators such as thromboxane A\\n2 which may\\nprobably be responsible for coronary vasospasm in thealready atherosclerotic vessel.\\nBased on progressive pathological changes and clinical\\ncorrelation, American Heart Association (1995) has classifiedhuman coronary atherosclerosis into 6 sequential types inascending order of grades of lesions as shown in Table 16.2.\\nIII. Non-atherosclerotic Causes\\nSeveral other coronary lesions may cause IHD in less than\\n10% of cases. These are as under:\\n1. Vasospasm.  It has been possible to document vasospasm\\nof one of the major coronary arterial trunks in patients with\\nno significant atherosclerotic coronary narrowing which maycause angina or myocardial infarction.\\n2. Stenosis of coronary ostia.  Coronary ostial narrowing\\nmay result from extension of syphilitic aortitis or from aortic\\natherosclerotic plaques encroaching on the opening.\\n3. Arteritis.  Various types of inflammatory involvements\\nof coronary arteries or small branches like in rheumatic\\narteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, thrombo-angiitis obliterans(Buerger’s disease), Takayasu’s disease, Kawasaki’s disease,tuberculosis and other bacterial infections may contribute tomyocardial damage.\\n4. Embolism.  Rarely, emboli originating from elsewhere in\\nthe body may occlude the left coronary artery and its\\nbranches and produce IHD. The emboli may originate frombland thrombi, or from vegetations of bacterial endocarditis;rarely fat embolism and air embolism of coronary circulationmay occur.5. Thrombotic diseases.  Another infrequent cause of coro-\\nnary occlusion is from hypercoagulability of the blood such\\nas in shock, polycythaemia vera, sickle cell anaemia andthrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.\\n6. Trauma.  Contusion of a coronary artery from penetrating\\ninjuries may produce thrombotic occlusion.7. Aneurysms.  Extension of dissecting aneurysm of the\\naorta into the coronary artery may produce thrombotic\\ncoronary occlusion. Rarely, congenital, mycotic and syphi-litic aneurysms may occur in coronary arteries and producesimilar occlusive effects.\\n8. Compression.  Compression of a coronary from outside\\nby a primary or seco ndary tumour of the heart may result in\\ncoronary occlusion.\\nEFFECTS OF MYOCARDIAL ISCHAEMIA\\nDe\\nvelopment of lesions in the coronaries is not always\\naccompanied by cardiac disease. Depending upon the\\nsuddenness of onset, duration, degree, location and extentof the area affected by myocardial ischaemia, the range of\\nchanges and clinical features may vary from an asympto-\\nmatic state at one extreme to immediate mortality at another(Fig. 16.14):\\nA.Asymptomatic state\\nB.Angina pectoris (AP)\\nC\\n. Acute myocardial infarction (MI)\\nD. Chronic ischaemic heart disease (CIHD)/ Ischaemic\\ncardiomyopathy/ Myocardial fibrosis\\nE.

It is characterised byparoxysmal pain in the substernal or precordial region ofthe chest which is aggravated by an increase in the demandof the heart and relieved by a decrease in the work of theheart. Often, the pain radiates to the left arm, neck, jaw orright arm. It is more common in men past 5th decade of life.\\nThere are 3 overlapping clinical patterns of angina\\npectoris with some differences in their pathogenesis:i)Stable or typical angina\\nii)\\nPrinzmetal’s variant angina\\niii) Unstable or crescendo angina\\nSTABLE OR TYPICAL ANGINA.  This is the most common\\npattern. Stable or typical angina is characterised by attacks\\nof pain following physical exertion or emotional excitementand is relieved by rest. The pathogenesis of condition lies inchronic stenosing coronary atherosclerosis  that cannot perfuse\\nthe myocardium adequately when the workload on the heartincreases. During the attacks, there is depression of STsegment in the ECG due to poor perfusion of thesubendocardial region of the left ventricle but there is noelevation of enzymes in the blood as there is no irreversiblemyocardial injury.\\nPRINZMETAL’S VARIANT ANGINA.  This pattern of\\nangina is characterised by pain at rest and has no relation-\\nship with physical activity. The exact pathogenesis ofPrinzmetal’s angina is not known. It may occur due to suddenvasospasm  of a coronary trunk induced by coronary\\natherosclerosis, or may be due to release of humoralvasoconstrictors by mast cells in the coronary adventitia. ECGshows ST segment elevation due to transmural ischaemia.These patients respond well to vasodilators like nitroglycerin.\\nUNSTABLE OR CRESCENDO ANGINA.  Also referred to\\nas ‘pre-infarction angina’ or ‘acute coronary insufficiency’,\\nthis is the most serious pattern of angina. It is characterisedby more frequent onset of pain of prolonged duration andoccurring often at rest. It is thus indicative of an impendingacute myocardial infarction. Distinction between unstableangina and acute MI is made by ST segment changes onECG— acute MI characterised by ST segment elevation whileunstable angina  may have non-ST segment elevation MI.Multiple factors  are involved in the pathogenesis of unstable\\nangina which include: stenosing coronary atherosclerosis,complicated coronary plaques (e.g. superimposedthrombosis, haemorrhage, rupture, ulceration etc), plateletthrombi over atherosclerotic plaques and vasospasm ofcoronary arteries. More often, the lesions lie in a branch ofthe major coronary trunk so that collaterals preventinfarction.\\nACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\\nAcute myocardial infarction (MI) is the most important and\\nfeared consequence of coronary artery disease. Many patientsmay die within the first few hours of the onset, whileremainder suffer from effects of impaired cardiac function.A significant factor that may prevent or diminish themyocardial damage is the development of collateralcirculation through anastomotic channels over a period oftime. A regular and well-planned exercise programme\\nencourages good collateral circulation and improved cardiac\\nperformance.\\nINCIDENCE.  In developed countries, acute MI accounts for\\n10-25% of all deaths. Due to the dominant etiologic role of\\ncoronary atherosclerosis in acute MI, the incidence of acuteMI correlates well with the incidence of atherosclerosis in ageographic area.\\nAge.  Acute MI may virtually occur at all ages, though the\\nincidence is higher in the elderly. About 5% of heart attacks\\noccur in young people under the age of 40 years, particularlyin those with major risk factors to develop atherosclerosislike hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking anddyslipidaemia with familial hypercholesterolaemia.\\nSex.  Males throughout their life are at a significantly higher\\nrisk of developing acute MI as compared to females. Women\\nduring reproductive period have remarkably low incidenceof acute MI, probably due to the protective influence ofoestrogen. The use of oral contraceptives is associated withhigh risk of developing acute MI. After menopause, this sexdifference gradually declines but the incidence of diseaseamong women never reaches that among men of the sameage.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The etiologic role of severe coro-\\nnary atherosclerosis (more than 75% compromise of lumen)\\nof one or more of the three major coronary arterial trunks inthe pathogenesis of about 90% cases of acute MI is welldocumented by autopsy studies as well as by coronary angio-graphic studies. A few notable features in the developmentof acute MI are as under:Figure 16.14 Spectrum of coronary ischaemic manifestations.\\n430SECTION III Systemic Pathology1. Myocardial ischaemia.  Myocardial ischaemia is brought\\nabout by one or more of the following mechanisms:\\ni) Diminised coronary blood flow e.g. in coronary artery\\ndisease, shock.ii) Increased myocardial demand e.g. in exercise, emotions.iii) Hypertrophy of the heart without simultaneous increase\\nof coronary blood flow e.g. in hypertension, valvular heart\\ndisease.\\n2. Role of platelets.  Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque\\nexposes the subendothelial collagen to platelets which\\nundergo aggregation, activation and release reaction. These\\nevents contribute to the build-up of the platelet mass that\\nmay give rise to emboli or initiate thrombosis.\\n3. Acute plaque rupture.  In general, slowly-developing\\ncoronary ischaemia from stenosing coronary atherosclerosis\\nof high-grade may not cause acute MI but continue to\\nproduce episodes of angina pectoris. But acute complications\\nin coronary atherosclerotic plaques in the form ofsuperimposed coronary thrombosis due to plaque ruptureand plaque haemorrhage is frequently encountered in cases\\nof acute MI:\\ni) Superimposed coronary thrombosis  due to disruption of\\nplaque is seen in about half the cases of acute MI. Infusion ofintracoronary fibrinolysins in the first half an hour of\\ndevelopment of acute MI in such cases restores blood flow\\nin the blocked vessel in majority of cases.ii)Intramural haemorrhage  is found in about one-third cases\\nof acute MI.\\nPlaque haemorrhage and thrombosis may occur together\\nin some cases.\\n4. Non-atherosclerotic causes.  About 10% cases of acute MI\\nare caused by non-atherosclerotic factors such as coronary\\nvasospasm, arteritis, coronary ostial stenosis, embolism,\\nthrombotic diseases, trauma and outside compression as\\nalready described.\\n5. Transmural versus  subendocardial infarcts.  There are\\nsome differences in the pathogenesis of the transmural infarcts\\ninvolving the full thickness of ventricular wall and the\\nsubendocardial (laminar) infarcts  affecting the inner\\nsubendocardial one-third to half. These are as under(Table 16.3):i) Transmural (full thickness) infarcts  are the most common\\ntype seen in 95% cases. Critical coronary narrowing (more\\nthan 75% compromised lumen) is of great significance in the\\ncausation of such infarcts. Atherosclerotic plaques withsuperimposed thrombosis and intramural haemorrhage aresignificant in about 90% cases, and non-atherosclerotic causesin the remaining 1 0% cases.\\nii)Subendocardial (laminar) infarcts  have their genesis in\\nreduced coronary perfusion due to coronary atherosclerosisbut without critical stenosis (not necessarily 75% compro-\\nmised lumen), aortic stenosis or haemorrhagic shock. This is\\nbecause subendocardial myocardium is normally least well\\nperfused by coronaries and thus is more vulnerable to anyreduction in the coronary flow. Superimposed coronarythrombosis is frequently encountered in these cases too, andhence the beneficial role of fibrinolytic treatment in suchpatients.\\nTYPES OF INFARCTS.  Infarcts have been classified in a\\nnumber of ways by the physicians and the pathologists:\\n1.According to the anatomic region of the left ventricle invol-\\nved, they are called anterior, posterior (inferior), lateral, septal\\nand circumferential, and their combinations like antero-\\nlateral, posterolateral (or inferolateral) and anteroseptal.\\n2.According to the degree of thickness of the ventricular wall\\ninvolved,  infarcts are of two types (Fig. 16.15):\\ni\\n) Full-thickness or transmural, when they involve the entire\\nthickness of the ventricular wall.\\nii)Subendocardial or laminar, when they occupy the inner\\nsubendocardial half of the myocardium.\\n3.According to the age of infarcts,  they are of two types:\\ni)\\nNewly-formed infarcts called as acute, recent or fresh.\\nii) Advanced infarcts called as old, healed or organised.\\nLOCATION OF INFARCTS.  Infarcts are most frequently\\nlocated in the left ventricle. Right ventricle is less susceptible\\nto infarction due to its thin wall, having less metabolicrequirements and is thus adequately nourished by thethebesian vessels. Atrial infarcts, whenever present, are moreoften in the right atrium, usually accompanying the infarct\\nof the left ventricle. Left atrium is relatively protected from\\ninfarction because it is supplied by the oxygenated blood inthe left atrial chamber.\\nThe region of infarction depends upon the area of\\nobstructed blood supply by one or more of the three coro-nary arterial trunks. Accordingly, there are three regions of\\nmyocardial infarction (Fig. 16.16):\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 16.3: Contrasting Features of Subendocardial and Transmural Infarcts.\\nFeature Transmural Infarct Subendocardial Infarct\\n1.

Epicarditis Common NoneFigure 16.15 Diagrammatic representation of extent of myocardial\\ninfarction in the depth of myocardium.\\n431CHAPTER 16 The Heart1.Stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery  is the\\nmost common (40-50%). The region of infarction is the\\nanterior part of the left ventricle including the apex and the\\nanterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum.\\n2. Stenosis of the right coronary artery  is the next most\\nfrequent (30-40%). It involves the posterior part of the left\\nventricle and the posterior one-third of the interventricularseptum.3.Stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery  is seen least\\nfrequently (15-20%). Its area of involvement is the lateral wallof the left ventricle.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The gross and microscopic\\nchanges in the myocardial infarction vary according tothe age of the infarct and are therefore describedsequentially (Table 16.4).\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 16.4: Sequential Pathologic Changes in Myocardial Infarction.\\nTime Gross Changes Light Microscopy\\nFIRST WEEK\\n0-6 hours No change or pale; TTC/ NBT test No change; (?) stretching and waviness of fibres\\nnegative in infarcted area\\n6-12 hours -do- Coagulative necrosis begins; neutrophilic infiltration begins; oedema\\nand haemorrhages present\\n24 hours Cyanotic red-purple area of haemorrhage Coagulative necrosis progresses; marginal neutrophilic infiltrate\\n48-72 hours Pale, hyperaemic Coagulative necrosis complete, neutrophilic infiltrate well\\ndeveloped\\n3-7th day Hyperaemic border, centre yellow and soft\\nNeutrophils are necrosed and gradually disappear, beginning of\\nresorption of necrosed fibres by macrophages, onset of fibrovascular\\nresponse\\nSECOND WEEK\\n10th day Red-purple periphery Most of the necrosed muscle in a small infarct removed; fibrovascular\\nreaction more prominent; pigmented macrophages, eosinophils,\\nlymphocytes, plasma cells present\\n14th day — Necrosed muscle mostly removed; neutrophils disappear;fibrocollagenic tissue at the periphery\\nTHIRD WEEK — Necrosed muscle fibres from larger infarcts removed; more ingrowth\\nof fibrocollagenic tissue\\nFOURTH TO SIXTH Thin, grey-white, hard, shrunken Increased fibrocollagenic tissue, decreased vascularity; fewer\\nWEEK fibrous scar pigmented macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cellsFigure 16.16 Common locations and the regions of involvement in myocardial infarction  The figure shows region of myocardium affected by\\nstenosis of three respective coronary trunks in descending order shown as: 1) left anterior descending coronary, 2) right coron ary and 3) left\\ncircumflex coronary artery. A, As viewed from anterior surface. B, As viewed on transverse section at the apex of the heart.\\n432SECTION III Systemic PathologyGrossly,  most infarcts occur singly and vary in size from\\n4 to 10 cm. As explained above, they are found most often\\nin the left ventricle. Less often, there are multifocal lesions.The transmural infarcts, which by definition involve theentire thickness of the ventricular wall, usually have a thinrim of preserved subendocardial myocardium which isperfused directly by the blood in the ventricular chamber.The subendocardial infarcts which affect the inner sub-endocardial half of the myocardium produce less well-defined gross changes than the transmural infarcts. Thesequence of macroscopic changes in all myocardial infarctsis as under:1.In 6 to 12 hours old infarcts,  no striking gross changes\\nare discernible except that the affected myocardium isslightly paler and drier than normal. However, the earlyinfarcts (3 to 6 hours old) can be detected by histochemicalstaining for dehydrogenases  on unfixed slice of the heart.\\nThis consists of immersing a slice of unfixed heart in thesolution of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) whichimparts red brown colour to the normal heart muscle,while the area of infarcted muscle fails to stain due to lackof dehydrogenases. Another stain for viability of cardiacmuscle is nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) dye which impartsblue colour to unaffected cardiac muscle while infarctedmyocardium remains unstained.2.By about 24 hours,  the infarct develops cyanotic, red-\\npurple, blotchy areas of haemorrhage due to stagnationof blood.3.During the next 48 to 72 hours,  the infarct develops a\\nyellow border due to neutrophilic infiltration and thusbecomes more well-defined.4.In 3-7 days,  the infarct has hyperaemic border while\\nthe centre is yellow and soft.5.By 10 days,  the periphery of the infarct appears reddish-\\npurple due to growth of granulation tissue. With thepassage of time, further healing takes place; the necroticmuscle is resorbed and the infarct shrinks and becomespale grey.6.By the end of 6 weeks,  the infarcted area is replaced by a\\nthin, grey-white, hard, shrunken fibrous scar which is welldeveloped in about 2 to 3 months. However, the time takenby an infarct to heal by fibrous scar may vary dependingupon the size of the infarct and adequacy of collateralcirculation (Fig. 16.17).\\nMicroscopically,  the changes are similar in both trans-\\nmural and subendocardial infarcts. As elsewhere in thebody, myocardial ischaemia induces ischaemiccoagulative necrosis of the myocardium which eventuallyheals by fibrosis. However, sequential light microscopicchanges are observed as described below anddiagrammatically shown in Fig. 16.18.\\n1. First week:  The progression of changes takes place in\\nthe following way:i)In the first 6 hours  after infarction, usually no detec-\\ntable histologic change is observed in routine light micros-copy. However, some investigators have describedstretching and waviness of the myocardial fibres withinone hour of the onset of ischaemia.ii)After 6 hours,  there is appearance of some oedema fluid\\nbetween the myocardial fibres. The muscle fibres at themargin of the infarct show vacuolar degeneration calledmyocytolysis.iii)B\\ny 12 hours,  coagulative necrosis of the myocardial\\nfibres sets in and neutrophils begin to appear at the marginof the infarct. Coagulative necrosis of fibres ischaracterised by loss of striations and intense eosinophilic,hyaline appearance and may show nuclear changes likekaryolysis, pyknosis and karyorrhexis. Haemorrhages andoedema are present in the interstitium.iv) During the first 24 hours,  coagulative necrosis pro-\\ngresses further as evidenced by shrunken eosinophiliccytoplasm and pyknosis of the nuclei. The neutrophilicinfiltrate at the margins of the infarct is slight.v) During the first 48 to 72 hours,  coagulative necrosis is\\ncomplete with loss of nuclei. The neutrophilic infiltrate iswell developed and extends centrally into the interstitium.vi)In 3-7 days,  neutrophils are necrosed and gradually\\ndisappear. The process of resorption of necrosed musclefibres by macrophages begins. Simultaneously, there isonset of proliferation of capillaries and fibroblasts fromthe margins of the infarct (Fig. 16.19).\\n2. Second week:  The changes are as under:\\ni)By 10th day,  most of the necrosed muscle at the peri-\\nphery of infarct is removed. The fibrovascular reaction atthe margin of infarct is more prominent. Many pigmentedmacrophages containing yellow-brown lipofuscin(derived from breakdown of myocardial cells) and goldenbrown haemosiderin (derived from lysed erythrocytes inhaemorrhagic areas) are seen. Also present are a few otherinflammatory cells like eosinophils, lymphocytes andplasma cells.ii\\n) By the end of the 2nd week,  most of the necrosed muscle\\nin small infarcts is removed, neutrophils have almostdisappeared, and newly laid collagen fibres replace theperiphery of the infarct.\\nFigure 16.17 Myocardial infarction, healed.

Third week:  Necrosed muscle fibres from larger\\ninfarcts continue to be removed and replaced by ingrowth\\nof newly formed collagen fibres. Pigmented macrophagesas well as lymphocytes and plasma cells are prominentwhile eosinophils gradually disappear.Figure 16.18 Sequence of light microscopic changes in myocardial\\ninfarction.(For details, consult the text).Figure 16.19 Old myocardial infarct. The infarcted area shows\\ningrowth of inflammatory granulation tissue.\\n4. Fourth to sixth week:  With further removal of necrotic\\ntissue, there is increase in collagenous connective tissue,decreased vascularity and fewer pigmented macrophages,lymphocytes and plasma cells. Thus, at the end of 6 weeks,a contracted fibrocollagenic scar with diminishedvascularity is formed. The pigmented macrophages maypersist for a long duration in the scar, sometimes for years.\\nA summary of the sequence of gross and microscopic\\nchanges in myocardial infarction of varying duration ispresented in Table 16.4.\\nSALVAGE IN EARLY INFARCTS AND REPERFUSIONINJURY. In vast majority of cases of acute MI, occlusive\\ncoronary artery thrombosis has been demonstratedsuperimposed on fibrofatty plaque. The ischaemic injuryto myocardium is reversible if perfusion is restored withinthe first 30 minutes of onset of infarction failing whichirreversible ischaemic necrosis of myocardium sets in. Thesalvage in early infarcts can be achieved by the followinginterventions:1.Institution of thrombolytic therapy  with thrombolytic\\nagents such as streptokinase and tissue plasminogenactivator (door-to-needle time  \\n<30 minutes).\\n2.Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).\\n3.Coronary artery stenting.\\n4.Coronary artery bypass surgery.However, attempt at reperfusion is fraught with the\\nrisk of ischaemic reperfusion injury (Chapter 3).  Furthermyonecrosis during reperfusion occurs due to rapid influxof calcium ions and generation of toxic oxygen freeradicals.\\nGrossly, the myocardial infarct following reperfusion\\ninjury appears haemorrhagic  rather than pale.\\nMicroscopically,  myofibres show contraction band necrosis\\nwhich are transverse and thick eosinophilic bands.\\n434SECTION III Systemic PathologyCHANGES IN EARLY INFARCTS.  By special techniques\\nlike electron microscopy, chemical and histochemical studies,\\nchanges can be demonstrated in early infarcts beforedetectable light microscopic alterations appear.\\n1. Electron microscopic changes.  Changes by EM\\nexamination are evident in less than half an hour on onset of\\ninfarction. These changes are as under:i)Disappearance of perinuclear glycogen granules within\\n5 minutes of ischaemia.\\nii)\\nSwelling of mitochondria in 20 to 30 minutes.\\niii) Disruption of sarcolemma.\\niv) Nuclear alterations like peripheral clumping of nuclearchromatin.\\n2. Chemical and histochemical changes.  Analysis of tissues\\nfrom early infarcts by chemical and histochemical techniques\\nhas shown a number of findings. These are as follows:\\ni)Glycogen depletion in myocardial fibres within 30 to 60\\nminutes of infarction.ii)\\nIncrease in lactic acid in the myocardial fibres.\\niii) Loss of K+ from the ischaemic fibres.\\niv) Increase of Na+ in the ischaemic cells.\\nv) Influx of Ca++ into the cells causing irreversible cell injury.\\nBased on the above observations and on leakage of\\nenzymes from the ischaemic myocardium, alterations in theconcentrations of various enzymes are detected in the bloodof these patients.\\nDIAGNOSIS.  The diagnosis of acute MI is made on the\\nobservations of 3 types of features—clinical features, ECG\\nchanges, and serum enzyme determinations.\\n1. Clinical features.  Typically, acute MI has a sudden onset.\\nThe following clinical features usually characterise a case of\\nacute MI.i)Pain:  Usually sudden, severe, crushing and prolonged,\\nsubsternal or precordial in location, unrelieved by rest ornitroglycerin, often radiating to one or both the arms, neckand back.\\nii)Indigestion:  Pain is often accompanied by epigastric or\\nsubsternal discomfort interpreted as ‘heartburn’ with nausea\\nand vomiting.iii)Apprehensi on: The patient is often terrified, restless and\\napprehensive due to great fear of death.iv)Shock:  Systolic blood pressure is below 80 mmHg;\\nlethargy, cold clammy limbs, peripheral cyanosis, weak\\npulse, tachycardia or bradycardia are often present.v)Oliguria:  Urine flow is usually less than 20 ml per hour.\\nvi)Low grade fever:  Mild rise in temperature occurs within\\n24 hours and lasts up to one week, accompanied byleucocytosis and elevated ESR.vii) Acute pulmonary oedema:  Some cases develop severe\\npulmonary congestion due to left ventricular failure anddevelop suffocation, dyspnoea, orthopnoea and bubblingrespiration.\\n2.ECG changes.  The ECG changes are one of the most\\nimportant parameters. Most characteristic ECG change is ST\\nsegment elevation in acute MI (termed as STEMI); otherchanges inlcude T wave inversion and appearance of widedeep Q waves (Fig. 16.20).\\n3.Serum cardiac markers.  Certain proteins and enzymes\\nare released into the blood from necrotic heart muscle afteracute MI. Measurement of their levels in serum is helpful inmaking a diagnosis and plan management. Rapid assay ofsome more specific cardiac proteins is available renderingthe estimation of non-specific estimation of SGOT of historicalimportance only in current practice. Important myocardialmarkers in use nowadays are as under (Fig. 16.21):\\ni)Creatine phosphokinase  (CK) and CK-MB:  CK has three\\nforms—\\nCK-MM derived from skeletal muscle;\\nCK-BB derived from brain and lungs; and\\nCK-MB, mainly from cardiac muscles and insignificant\\namount from extracardiac tissue.\\nThus total CK estimation lacks specificity while elevation\\nof CK-MB isoenzyme is considerably specific for myocardialdamage. CK-MB has further 2 forms—CK-MB2 is themyocardial form while CK-MB1 is extracardiac form. A ratioof CK-MB2: CK-MB1 above 1.5 is highly sensitive for thediagnosis of acute MI after 4-6 hours of onset of myocardialischaemia. CK-MB disappears from blood by 48 hours.\\nii)Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH).  Total LDH estimation also\\nlacks specificity since this enzyme is present in various tissues\\nbesides myocardium such as in skeletal muscle, kidneys,liver, lungs and red blood cells. However, like CK, LDH toohas two isoforms of which LDH-1 is myocardial-specific.Figure 16.20 Some common ECG changes in acute myocardial infarction.\\n435CHAPTER 16 The HeartEstimation of ratio of LDH-1: LDH-2 above 1 is reasonably\\nhelpful in making a diagnosis. LDH levels begin to rise after24 hours, reach peak in 3 to 6 days and return to normal in14 days.\\niii)Cardiac-specific troponins (cTn):  Immunoassay of cTn as a\\nserum cardiac marker has rendered LDH estimation obsolete.\\nTroponins are contractile muscle proteins present in humancardiac and skeletal muscle but cardiac troponins are specificfor myocardium. There are two types of cTn:\\ncardiac troponin T (cTnT); and\\ncardiac troponin I (cTnI).\\nBoth cTnT and cTnI are not found in the blood normally,\\nbut after myocardial injury their levels rise very high around\\nthe same time when CK-MB is elevated (i.e. after 4-6 hours).Both troponin levels remain high for much longer duration;cTnI for 7-10 days and cTnT for 10-14 days.\\niv)Myoglobin:  Though myoglobin is the first cardiac marker\\nto become elevated after myocardial infarction, it lacks\\ncardiac specificity and is excreted in the urine rapidly. Itslevels, thus, return to normal within 24 hours of attack ofacute MI.\\nCOMPLICATIONS.  Following an attack of acute MI, only\\n10-20% cases do not develop major complications and\\nrecover. The remainder 80-90% cases develop one or moremajor complications, some of which are fatal. The immediatemortality from acute MI (sudden cardiac death) is about 25%.The important complications which may develop followingacute MI are as follows:\\n1. Arrhythmias.  Arrhythmias (or abnormalities in the\\nnormal heart rhythm) are the most common complication in\\nacute MI. These occur due to ischaemic injury or irritation tothe conduction system, resulting in abnormal rhythm. Othercauses of arrhythmias include leakage of K\\n+ from ischaemic\\nmuscle cells and increased concentration of lactate and freefatty acids in the tissue fluid. Arrhythmias may be in theform of sinus tachycardia or sinus bradycardia, atrial fibril-lation, premature systoles, and the most serious ventricularfibrillation responsible for many sudden cardiac deaths.2. Congestive heart failure.  About half the patients with\\nMI develop CHF which may be in the form of rightventricular failure, left ventricular failure or both. CHF isresponsible for about 40% of deaths from acute MI. If thepatient survives, healing may restore normal cardiac functionbut in some CHF may persist and require regular treatmentlater.\\n3. Cardiogenic shock.  About 10% of patients with acute MI\\ndevelop cardiogenic shock characterised by hypotension with\\nsystolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg or less for many days.Shock may be accompanied by peripheral circulatory failure,oliguria and mental confusion.\\n4. Mural thrombosis and thromboembolism.  The incidence\\nof thromboembolism from intracardiac thrombi and from\\nthrombosis in the leg veins is 15-45% in cases of acute MIand is the major cause of death in 12% cases. Muralthrombosis in the heart develops due to involvement of theendocardium and subendocardium in the infarct and due toslowing of the heart rate. Mural thrombi often form thrombo-emboli. Another source of thromboemboli is the venousthrombosis in the leg veins due to prolonged bed rest.Thromboemboli from either source may cause occlusion ofthe pulmonary, renal, mesenteric, splenic, pancreatic orcerebral arteries and cause infarcts in these organs.\\n5. Rupture.  Rupture of the heart occurs in up to 5% cases of\\nacute MI causing death. Rupture occurs most often from the\\ninfarcted ventricular wall into the pericardial cavity causinghaemopericardium and tamponade. Other sites of ruptureare through interventricular septum and rupture of apapillary muscle in infarct of the left ventricle. Rupture atany of these sites occurs usually in the first week and is oftenfatal.\\n6. Cardiac aneurysm.  Another 5% of patients of acute MI\\ndevelop aneurysm, often of the left ventricle. It occurs in\\nhealed infarcts through thin, fibrous, non-elastic scar tissue.Cardiac aneurysms impair the function of the heart and arethe common sites for mural thrombi. Rarely, calcification ofthe wall of aneurysm may occur.Figure 16.21 Time course of serum cardiac markers for the diagnosis of acute MI.\\n436SECTION III Systemic Pathology7. Pericarditis.  Sterile pericarditis appearing on about the\\nsecond day is common over transmural infarcts. It is\\ncharacterised by fibrinous pericarditis and may be associatedwith pericardial effusion. Often, it is of no functionalsignificance and resolves spontaneously.\\n8. Postmyocardial infarction syndrome.  About 3 to 4% of\\npatients who suffered from acute MI develop postmyocardial\\ninfarction syndrome or Dressler’s syndrome  subsequently. It\\nusually occurs 1 to 6 weeks after the attack of MI. It ischaracterised by pneumonitis. The symptoms are usuallymild and disappear in a few weeks. The exact pathogenesisof this syndrome is not known. It may be due to autoimmunereaction as evidenced by circulating anti-heart antibodies inthe serum of these patients. But these antibodies are also pre-sent in patients with acute MI who do not develop thissyndrome.\\nCHRONIC ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE\\nChronic ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic cardiomyopathy\\nor myocardial fibrosis, are the terms used for focal or diffusefibrosis in the myocardium characteristically found in elderlypatients of progressive IHD. Such small areas of fibrousscarring are commonly found in the heart of patients whohave history of episodes of angina and attacks of MI someyears back. The patients generally have gradually developingCHF due to decompensation over a period of years. Occasio-nally, serious cardiac arrhythmias or infarction maysupervene and cause death.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  In majority of cases, coronary\\natherosclerosis causes progressive ischaemic myocardial\\ndamage and replacement by myocardial fibrosis. A smallpercentage of cases may result from other causes such asemboli, coronary arteritis and myocarditis.\\nThe mechanism of development of myocardial fibrosis\\ncan be explained by one of the following concepts:i)Myocardial fibrosis represents healing of minute infarcts\\ninvolving small scattered groups of myocardial fibres.ii) An alternate concept of development of myocardial\\nfibrosis is healing of minute areas of focal myocytolysis—the myocardial fibres in a small area undergo slowdegeneration due to myocardial ischaemia. These fibres losetheir myofibrils but nuclei remain intact. These foci areinfiltrated by macrophages and eventually are replaced byproliferating fibroblasts and collagen.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the heart may be\\nnormal in size or hypertrophied. The left ventricular wallgenerally shows foci of grey-white fibrosis in brownmyocardium. Healed scars of previous MI may be present.Valves of the left heart may be distorted, thickened andshow calcification. Coronary arteries invariably showmoderate to severe atherosclerosis.Microscopically,  the characteristic features are as follows\\n(Fig. 16.22):\\ni\\n) There are scattered areas of diffuse myocardial fibrosis,\\nespecially around the small blood vessels in the interstitial\\ntissue of the myocardium.\\nii) Intervening single fibres and groups of myocardial\\nfibres show variation in fibre size and foci of myocytolysis.\\niii)Areas of brown atrophy of the myocardium may also\\nbe present.i\\nv) Coronary arteries show atherosclerotic plaques and\\nmay have complicated lesions in the form of super-\\nimposed thrombosis.\\nSUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH\\nSudden cardiac death is defined as sudden death within 24\\nhours of the onset of cardiac symptoms. The most importantcause is coronary atherosclerosis;  less commonly it may bedue to coronary vasospasm and other non-ischaemic causes.These include: calcific aortic stenosis, myocarditis of varioustypes, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse,endocarditis, and hereditary and acquired defects of theconduction system. The mechanism of sudden death by\\nFigure 16.22 Chronic ischaemic heart disease. There is patchy myocardial fibrosis, especially around small blood vessels in the interstitium .\\nThe intervening single cells and groups of myocardial cells show myocytolysis.\\n437CHAPTER 16 The Heartmyocardial ischaemia is almost always by fatal arrhythmias,\\nchiefly ventricular asystole or fibrillation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  At autopsy, such cases\\nreveal most commonly critical atherosclerotic coronarynarrowing (more than 75% compromised lumen) in oneor more of the three major coronary arterial trunks withsuperimposed thrombosis or plaque-haemorrhage.Healed and new myocardial infarcts are found in manycases.\\nTable 16.5  lists the important forms of coronary artery\\npathology in various types of IHD.\\nHYPERTENSIVE HEART DISEASE\\nHypertensive heart disease or hypertensive cardiomyopathyis the disease of the heart resulting from systemichypertension of prolonged duration and manifesting by leftventricular hypertrophy. Even mild hypertension (bloodpressure higher than 140/90 mmHg) of sufficient durationmay induce hypertensive heart disease. It is the second mostcommon form of heart disease after IHD. As already pointedout, hypertension predisposes to atherosclerosis. Therefore,most patients of hypertensive heart disease have advancedcoronary atherosclerosis and may develop progressive IHD.\\nAmongst the causes of death in hypertensive patients,\\ncardiac decompensation leading to CHF accounts for aboutone-third of the patients; other causes of death are IHD,cerebrovascular stroke, renal failure following arteriolarnephrosclerosis, dissecting aneurysm of the aorta and suddencardiac death.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The pathogenesis of systemic hyper-\\ntension is discussed later (Chapter 22). Pathogenesis of left\\nventricular hypertrophy (LVH) which is most commonlycaused by systemic hypertension is described here.\\nStimulus to LVH is pressure overload in systemic\\nhypertension. Both genetic and haemodynamic factorscontribute to LVH. The stress of pressure on the ventricularwall causes increased production of myofilaments,myofibrils, other cell organelles and nuclear enlargement.Since the adult myocardial fibres do not divide, the fibresare hypertrophied. However, the sarcomeres may divide toincrease the cell width.\\nLVH can be diagnosed by ECG. Aggressive control of\\nhypertension can regress the left ventricular mass but whichantihypertensive agents would do this, in addition to theirrole in controlling blood pressure, is not clearly known.Abnormalities of diastolic function in hypertension are morecommon in hypertension and is present in about one-thirdof patients with normal systolic function.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the most signifi-\\ncant finding is marked hypertrophy of the heart, chieflyof the left ventricle ( see Fig. 16.5). The weight of the heart\\nincreases to 500 gm or more (normal weight about 300gm). The thickness of the left ventricular wall increasesfrom its normal 13 to 15 mm up to 20 mm or more. Thepapillary muscles and trabeculae carneae are rounded andprominent. Initially, there is concentric hypertrophy  of the\\nleft ventricle (without dilatation). But when decompen-sation and cardiac failure supervene, there is eccentric\\nhypertrophy ( with dilatation) with thinning of the ventri-\\ncular wall and there may be dilatation and hypertrophyof right heart as well.\\nMicroscopically,  the features are not as prominent as\\nmacroscopic appearance. The changes include\\nenlargement and degeneration of myocardial fibres withfocal areas of myocardial fibrosis. In advanced cases, theremay be myocardial oedema and foci of necrosis in themyocardium.\\nCOR  PULMONALE\\nCor pulmonale ( cor = heart; pulmonale  = lung) or pulmonary\\nheart disease is the disease of right side of the heart resulting\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 16.5: Lesions in Coronary Artery in Various Forms of IHD.\\nTypes of IHD Coronary Lesion Morphology Clinical Effects\\n1.

It is characterised by right\\nventricular dilatation or hypertrophy, or both. Thus, corpulmonale is the right-sided counterpart of the hypertensiveheart disease described above.\\nDepending upon the rapidity of development, cor\\npulmonale may be acute or chronic:\\nAcute cor pulmonale  occurs following massive pulmonary\\nembolism resulting in sudden dilatation of the pulmonarytrunk, conus and right ventricle.\\nChronic cor pulmonale  is more common and is often\\npreceded by chronic pulmonary hypertension (Chapter 17).Following chronic lung diseases can cause chronicpulmonary hypertension and subsequent cor pulmonale:\\ni) Chronic emphysema\\nii) Chronic bronchitis\\niii) Pulmonary tuberculosisiv) Pneumoconiosis\\nv) Cystic fibrosis\\nvi) Hyperventilation in marked obesity (Pickwickian\\nsyndrome)\\nvii) Multiple organised pulmonary emboli.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Chronic lung diseases as well as diseases\\nof the pulmonary vessels cause increased pulmonaryvascular resistance. The most common underlyingmechanism causing increased pulmonary blood pressure(pulmonary hypertension) is by pulmonary vasoconstriction,activation of coagulation pathway and obliteration ofpulmonary arterial vessels. Pulmonary hypertension causespressure overload on the right ventricle and hence rightventricular enlargement. Initially, there is right ventricularhypertrophy, but as cardiac decompensation sets in and rightheart failure ensues, dilatation of right ventricle occurs.\\nThe sequence of events involved in the pathogenesis of\\ncor pulmonale is summarised in Fig. 16.23.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. In acute cor pulmonale,\\nthere is characteristic ovoid dilatation of the right ventricle,and sometimes of the right atrium. In chronic cor pulmonale,\\nthere is increase in thickness of the right ventricular wallfrom its normal 3 to 5 mm up to 10 mm or more. Often,there is dilatation of the right ventricle too.RHEUMATIC FEVER AND\\nRHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE\\nDEFINITION\\nRheumatic fever (RF) is a systemic, post-streptococcal, non-\\nsuppurative inflammatory disease, principally affecting theheart, joints, central nervous system, skin and subcutaneoustissues. The chronic stage of RF involves all the layers of theheart (pancarditis) causing major cardiac sequelae referredto as rheumatic heart disease (RHD). In spite of its namesuggesting an acute arthritis migrating from joint to joint, itis well known that it is the heart rather than the joints whichis first and major organ affected. William Boyd years agogave the dictum ‘rheumatism licks the joint, but bites the whole\\nheart’.\\nINCIDENCE\\nThe disease appears most commonly in children between\\nthe age of 5 to 15 years when the streptococcal infection ismost frequent and intense. Both the sexes are affected equally,though some investigators have noted a slight femalepreponderance.\\nThe geographic distribution, incidence and severity of\\nRF and RHD are generally related to the frequency andseverity of streptococcal pharyngeal infection. The diseaseis seen more commonly in poor socioeconomic strata of thesociety living in damp and overcrowded places whichpromote interpersonal spread of the streptococcal infection.Its incidence has declined in the developed countries as aresult of improved living conditions and early use ofantibiotics in streptococcal infection. But it is still commonin the developing countries of the world like in India,Pakistan, some Arab countries, parts of Africa and SouthAmerica. In India, RHD and RF continue to a major publichealth problem. In a multicentric survey in school-goingchildren by the Indian Council of Medical Research, anincidence of 1 to 5.5 per 1000 children has been reported.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS\\nAfter a long controversy, the etiologic role of preceding throat\\ninfection with β-haemolytic streptococci of group A in RF is\\nnow well accepted. However, the mechanism of lesions inthe heart, joints and other tissues is not by direct infectionbut by induction of hypersensitivity or autoimmunity. Thus,there are 2 types of evidences in the etiology andpathogenesis of RF and RHD: the epidemiologic evidence  and\\nthe immunologic evidence.\\nA. EPIDEMIOLOGIC EVIDENCE.  There is a body of\\nclinical and epidemiological evidence to support the conceptthat RF occurs following infection of the throat and upperrespiratory tract with β-haemolytic streptococci of Lancefield\\ngroup A. These evidences are as under:1.There is often a history  of infection of the pharynx and\\nupper respiratory tract with this microorganism about 2 to 3weeks prior to the attack of RF. This period is usually thelatent period required for sensitisation to the bacteria.\\nFigure 16.23 Pathogenesis of cor pulmonale (RVH= right ventricular\\nhypertrophy, RHF= right heart failure).\\n439CHAPTER 16 The Heart2.Subsequent attacks  of streptococcal infection are generally\\nassociated with exacerbations of RF.\\n3. A higher incidence of RF has been observed afteroutbreaks and epidemics  of streptococcal infection of throat\\nin children from schools or in young men from trainingcamps.4. Administration of antibiotics  leads to lowering of the\\nincidence as well as severity of RF and its recurrences.5. Cardiac lesions similar to those seen in RHD have beenproduced in experimental animals by induction  of repeated\\ninfection with β-haemolytic streptococci of group A.\\n6. Patients with RF have elevated titres  of antibodies to the\\nantigens of β-haemolytic streptococci of group A such as anti-\\nstreptolysin O (ASO) and S, anti-streptokinase, anti-streptohyaluronidase and anti-DNAase B.7.Socioeconomic factors  like poverty, poor nutrition, density\\nof population, overcrowding in quarters for sleeping etc areassociated with spread of infection, lack of proper medicalattention, and hence higher incidence of RF.8. The geographic distribution  of the disease, as already\\npointed out, shows higher frequency and severity of thedisease in the developing countries of the world where theliving conditions are substandard and medical facilities areinsufficient. Populations in these regions develop recurrentthroat infections which remain untreated and have higherincidence of RF.9. The role of climate  in the development of RF has been\\nreported by some workers. The incidence of the disease ishigher in subtropical and tropical regions with cold, dampclimate near the rivers and waterways which favour thespread of infection.10. There is evidence to support the role of heredity.\\nSusceptibility to develop RF in families, occurrence inidentical twins and in individuals with HLA class II allelessupports the inherited characteristic of the disease.\\nDespite all these evidences, only a small proportion of\\npatients with streptococcal pharyngeal infection developRF—the attack rate is less than 3%. There is a suggestionthat a concomitant virus  enhances the effect of streptococci in\\nindividuals who develop RF.\\nB. IMMUNOLOGIC EVIDENCE.  It has been observed that\\nthough throat of patients during acute RF contain\\nstreptococci, the clinical symptoms of RF appear after a delayof 2-3 weeks and the organisms cannot be grown from thelesions in the target tissues. This has led to the concept thatlesions have immune pathogenesis.\\nA susceptible host, on being encountered with group A\\nstreptococcus infection, mounts an autoimmune reaction byformation of autoantibodies against bacteria. Theseautoantibodies cause damage to human tissues due to cross-reactivity between epitopes in the components of bacteriaand the host. Streptococcal epitopes present on the bacterialcell wall, cell membrane and the streptococcal M protein,are immunologically identical to human molecules onmyosin, keratin, actin, laminin, vimentin and N-acetylgluco-samine. This molecular mimicry and crossreactivity betweenstreptococcal M protein in particular and the humanmolecules forms the basis of autoimmune damage to humantarget tissues in RHD i.e. cardiac muscle, valves, joints, skin,neurons etc. Further evidences in support are as under:\\n1. Cell wall polysaccharide  of group A streptococcus forms\\nantibodies which are reactive against cardiac valves. This is\\nsupported by observation of persistently elevatedcorresponding autoantibodies in patients who have cardiacvalvular involvement than those without cardiac valveinvolvement.\\n2. Hyaluronate  capsule  of group A streptococcus is identical\\nto human hyaluronate present in joint tissues and thus these\\ntissues are the target of attack.\\n3. Membrane antigens  of group A streptococcus react with\\nsarcolemma of smooth and cardiac muscle, dermal fibroblasts\\nand neurons of caudate nucleus.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES\\nRF is generally regarded as an autoimmune focal\\ninflammatory disorder of the connective tissuesthroughout the body. The cardiac lesions of RF in the form\\nof pancarditis, particularly the valvular lesions, are itsmajor manifestations. However, supportive connectivetissues at other sites like the synovial membrane,periarticular tissue, skin and subcutaneous tissue, arterialwall, lungs, pleura and the CNS are all affected(extracardiac lesions ).\\nA. Cardiac Lesions\\nThe cardiac manifestations of RF are in the form of focal\\ninflammatory involvement of the interstitial tissue of allthe three layers of the heart, the so-called pancarditis.  The\\npathognomonic feature of pancarditis in RF is the presenceof distinctive Aschoff nodules  or Aschoff bodies.\\nTHE ASCHOFF NODULES OR BODIES.  The Aschoff\\nnodules or the Aschoff bodies are spheroidal or fusiformdistinct tiny structures, 1-2 mm in size, occurring in theinterstitium of the heart in RF and may be visible to nakedeye. They are especially found in the vicinity of smallblood vessels in the myocardium and endocardium andoccasionally in the pericardium and the adventitia of theproximal part of the aorta. Lesions similar to the Aschoffnodules may be found in the extracardiac tissues.\\nEvolution  of fully-developed Aschoff bodies involves 3\\nstages all of which may be found in the same heart atdifferent stages of development. These are as follows:\\n1. Early (exudative or degenerative) stage.  The earliest\\nsign of injury in the heart in RF is apparent by about 4th\\nweek  of illness. Initially, there is oedema of the connective\\ntissue and increase in acid mucopolysaccharide in the\\nground substance. This results in separation of thecollagen fibres by accumulating ground substance.Eventually, the collagen fibres are fragmented anddisintegrated and the affected focus takes the appearanceand staining characteristics of fibrin. This change isreferred to as fibrinoid degeneration.\\n2. Intermediate (proliferative or granulomatous) stage.It is this stage of the Aschoff body which is pathognomonicof rheumatic conditions (Fig. 16.24).  This stage is apparent440SECTION III Systemic Pathologyin 4th to 13th week of illness. The early stage of fibrinoid\\nchange is followed by proliferation of cells that includesinfiltration by lymphocytes (mostly T cells), plasma cells,a few neutrophils and the characteristic cardiac histiocytes\\n(Anitschkow cells ) at the margin of the lesion. Cardiac\\nhistiocytes or Anitschkow cells are present in smallnumbers in normal heart but their number is increased inthe Aschoff bodies; therefore they are not characteristicof RHD. These are large mononuclear cells having centralround nuclei and contain moderate amount ofamphophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei are vesicular andcontain prominent central chromatin mass which inlongitudinal section appears serrated or caterpillar-like,while in cross-section the chromatin mass appears as asmall rounded body in the centre of the vesicular nucleus,just like an owl’s eye. Some of these modified cardiachistiocytes become multinucleate cells containing 1 to 4nuclei and are called Aschoff cells and are pathognomonic\\nof RHD .\\n3. Late (healing or fibrous) stage.  The stage of healing by\\nfibrosis of the Aschoff nodule occurs in about  12 to 16 weeks\\nafter the illness. The nodule becomes oval or fusiform inshape, about 200 μm wide and 600 μm long. The\\nAnitschkow cells in the nodule become spindle-shapedwith diminished cytoplasm and the nuclei stain solidlyrather than showing vesicular character. These cells tendto be arranged in a palisaded manner. With passage ofmonths and years, the Aschoff body becomes less cellularand the collagenous tissue is increased. Eventually, it isreplaced by a small fibrocollagenous scar with littlecellularity, frequently in perivascular location.\\nRHEUMATIC PANCARDITIS.  Although all the three\\nlayers of the heart are affected in RF, the intensity of their\\ninvolvement is variable.1. RHEUMATIC ENDOCARDITIS.  Endocardial lesions\\nof RF may involve the valvular and mural endocardium,causing rheumatic valvulitis  and mural endocarditis,\\nrespectively. Rheumatic valvulitis is chiefly responsiblefor the major cardiac manifestations in chronic RHD.\\nRHEUMATIC VALVULITIS.  Grossly,  the valves in acute\\nRF show thickening and loss of translucency of the valve\\nleaflets or cusps. This is followed by the formation of\\ncharacteristic, small (1 to 3 mm in diameter), multiple,warty vegetations  or verrucae,  chiefly along the line of\\nclosure of the leaflets and cusps. These tiny vegetationsare almost continuous so that the free margin of the cuspsor leaflets appears as a rough and irregular ridge. Thevegetations in RF appear grey-brown, translucent and arefirmly attached so that they are not likely to get detachedto form emboli, unlike the friable vegetations of infectiveendocarditis (page 445).\\nThough all the four heart valves are affected, their\\nfrequency and severity of involvement varies: mitral valvealone being the most common site, followed in decreasingorder of frequency, by combined mitral and aortic valve\\n(Fig. 16.25).  The tricuspid and pulmonary valves usually\\nshow infrequent and slight involvement. The higher\\nincidence of vegetations on left side of the heart is possiblybecause of the greater mechanical stresses on the valvesof the left heart, especially along the line of closure of thevalve cusps (Fig. 16.26, A) . The occurrence of vegetations\\non the atrial surfaces of the atrioventricular valves (mitraland tricuspid) and on the ventricular surface of thesemilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) further lends\\nFigure 16.24 An Aschoff body (granulomatous stage) in the\\nmyocardium.

Serial numbers 1, 2 and 3 are denoted for thefrequency of valvular involvement.\\n441CHAPTER 16 The Heartsupport to the role of mechanical pressure on the valves\\nin the pathogenesis of vegetations.\\nThe chronic stage of RHD  is characterised by\\npermanent deformity of one or more valves, especiallythe mitral (in 98% cases alone or along with other valves)and aortic. The approximate frequency of deformity ofvarious valves is as under:\\nMitral alone = 37% cases.\\nMitral + aortic = 27% cases.\\nMitral + aortic + tricuspid = 22% cases.\\nMitral + tricuspid  = 11% cases.\\nAortic alone = 2%.\\nMitral + aortic + tricuspid + pulmonary = less than\\n1% cases.\\nThus, mitral valve is almost always involved in RHD.\\nGross appearance of chronic healed mitral valve in RHDis characteristically ‘fish mouth’  or ‘button hole’  stenosis.\\nMitral stenosis and insufficiency are commonly combinedin chronic RHD; calcific aortic stenosis may also be found.These healed chronic valvular lesions in RHD occur dueto diffuse fibrocollagenous thickening and calcification ofthe valve cusps or leaflets which cause adhesions betweenthe lateral portions, especially in the region of thecommissures. Thickening, shortening and fusion of thechordae tendineae further contribute to the chronicvalvular lesions (Fig. 16.26, B).\\nMicroscopically,  the inflammatory changes begin in the\\nregion of the valve rings (where the leaflets are attachedto the fibrous annulus) and then extend throughout theentire leaflet, whereas vegetations are usually located onthe free margin of the leaflets and cusps.i)In the early (acute) stage,  the histological changes are\\noedema of the valve leaflet, presence of increased numberof capillaries and infiltration with lymphocytes, plasmacells, histiocytes with many Anitschkow cells and a fewpolymorphs. Occasionally, Aschoff bodies with centralfoci of fibrinoid necrosis and surrounded by palisade ofcardiac histiocytes are seen, but more often the cellularinfiltration is diffuse in acute stage of RF. Vegetationspresent at the free margins of cusps appear as eosinophilic,tiny structures mainly consisting of fibrin withsuperimposed platelet-thrombi and do not containbacteria  (Fig. 16.27, A).\\nii)In the healed (chronic) stage,  the vegetations have\\nundergone organisation. The valves show diffusethickening as a result of fibrous tissue with hyalinisation,and often calcification. Vascularisation of the valve cuspsmay still be evident in the form of thick-walled bloodvessels with narrowed lumina (Fig. 16.27, B).  Typical\\nAschoff bodies are rarely seen in the valves at this stage.\\nRHEUMATIC MURAL ENDOCARDITIS.  Mural endo-\\ncardium may also show features of rheumatic carditis\\nthough the changes are less conspicuous as compared tovalvular changes.\\nGrossly,  the lesions are seen most commonly as\\nMacCallum’s patch  which is the region of endocardial\\nsurface in the posterior wall of the left atrium just above\\nthe posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. MacCallum’s patchappears as a map-like area of thickened, roughened andwrinkled part of the endocardium (see Fig. 16.25).\\nMicroscopically,  the appearance of MacCallum’s patch\\nis similar to that seen in rheumatic valvulitis. The affectedarea shows oedema, fibrinoid change in the collagen, andcellular infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells andmacrophages with many Anitschkow cells. TypicalAschoff bodies may sometimes be found.\\n2.RHEUMATIC MYOCARDITIS. Grossly,  in the early\\n(acute)  stage,  the myocardium, especially of the left\\nventricle, is soft and flabby. In the intermediate stage,  the\\nFigure 16.26 Rheumatic valvulitis. A, Location of vegetations on the valves\\nof the left heart.

B, Opened upchambers and valves of the left heart show irregularly scarred mitral valve leavinga fish-mouth or buttonhole opening between its two cusps (black arrow). The freesurface and margin of the mitral valve shows tiny firm granular vegetations (whitearrow).442SECTION III Systemic Pathologyinterstitial tissue of the myocardium shows small foci of\\nnecrosis. Later, tiny pale foci of the Aschoff bodies maybe visible throughout the myocardium.\\nMicroscopically,  the most characteristic feature of\\nrheumatic myocarditis is the presence of distinctive\\nAschoff bodies. These diagnostic nodules are scatteredthroughout the interstitial tissue of the myocardium andare most frequent in the interventricular septum, leftventricle and left atrium. Derangements of the conductionsystem may, thus, be present. The Aschoff bodies are bestidentified in the intermediate stage when they appear asgranulomas with central fibrinoid necrosis and aresurrounded by palisade of Anitschkow cells andmultinucleate Aschoff cells. There is infiltration bylymphocytes, plasma cells and some neutrophils. In thelate stage, the Aschoff bodies are gradually replaced bysmall fibrous scars in the vicinity of blood vessels and theinflammatory infiltrate subsides. Presence of activeAschoff bodies along with old healed lesions is indicativeof rheumatic activity.\\n3. RHEUMATIC PERICARDITIS.  Inflammatory\\ninvolvement of the pericardium commonly accompanies\\nRHD.\\nGrossly,  the usual finding is fibrinous pericarditis in\\nwhich there is loss of normal shiny pericardial surface due\\nto deposition of fibrin on its surface and accumulation ofslight amount of fibrinous exudate in the pericardial sac.If the parietal pericardium is pulled off from the visceralpericardium, the two separated surfaces are shaggy dueto thick fibrin covering them. This appearance is oftenlikened to ‘bread and butter appearance’  i.e. resembling the\\nbuttered surfaces of two slices in a sandwich when theyare gently pulled apart. If fibrinous pericarditis fails toresolve and, instead, undergoes organisation, the twolayers of the pericardium form fibrous adhesions resultingin chronic adhesive pericarditis.\\nMicroscopically,  fibrin is identified on the surfaces. The\\nsubserosal connective tissue is infiltrated by lymphocytes,\\nplasma cells, histiocytes and a few neutrophils.Characteristic Aschoff bodies may be seen which laterundergo organisation and fibrosis. Organisation of theexudate causes fibrous adhesions between the visceral andparietal surfaces of the pericardial sac and obliterates thepericardial cavity.\\nB. Extracardiac Lesions\\nPatients of the syndrome of acute rheumatism develop\\nlesions in connective tissue elsewhere in the body, chieflythe joints, subcutaneous tissue, arteries, brain and lungs.\\n1. POLYARTHRITIS.  Acute and painful inflammation of\\nthe synovial membranes of some of the joints, especially the\\nlarger joints of the limbs, is seen in about 90% cases of RF inadults and less often in children. As pain and swellingsubside in one joint, others tend to get involved, producingthe characteristic ‘migratory polyarthritis ’ involving two or\\nmore joints at a time.\\nHistologically,  the changes are transitory. The synovial\\nmembrane and the periarticular connective tissue showhyperaemia, oedema, fibrinoid change and neutrophilicinfiltration. Sometimes, focal lesions resembling Aschoffbodies are observed. A serous effusion into the joint cavityis commonly present.\\n2. SUBCUTANEOUS NODULES.  The subcutaneous\\nnodules of RF occur more often in children than in adult.These nodules are small (0.5 to 2 cm in diameter), sphericalor ovoid and painless. They are attached to deeper structuresFigure 16.27 Rheumatic heart disease. A, Microscopic structure of the rheumatic valvulitis and a vegetation on the cusp of mitral valve in\\nsagittal section.

Characteristiclocations are extensor surfaces of the wrists, elbows, anklesand knees.\\nHistologically,  the subcutaneous nodules of RF are\\nrepresentative of giant Aschoff bodies of the heart. Theyconsist of 3 distinct zones: a central area with fibrinoidchanges, surrounded by a zone of histiocytes andfibroblasts forming a palisade arrangement, and theoutermost zone of connective tissue which is infiltratedby non-specific chronic inflammatory cells andproliferating blood vessels.\\nIt may be mentioned here that histologically similar but\\nclinically different subcutaneous lesions appear inrheumatoid arthritis; they are larger, painful and tender andpersist for months to years (Chapter 28).\\n3. ERYTHEMA MARGINATUM.  This non-pruritic\\nerythematous rash is characteristic of RF. The lesions occur\\nmainly on the trunk and proximal parts of the extremities.The erythematous area develops central clearing and hasslightly elevated red margins. The erythema is transient andmigratory.\\n4. RHEUMATIC ARTERITIS.  Arteritis in RF involves not\\nonly the coronary arteries and the aorta but also occurs in\\narteries of various other organs such as renal, mesenteric andcerebral arteries. The lesions in the coronaries are seen mainlyin the small intramyocardial branches.\\nHistologically,  the lesions may be like those of\\nhypersensitivity angiitis (Chapter 15), or sometimes mayresemble polyarteritis nodosa. Occasionally, foci offibrinoid necrosis or ill-formed Aschoff bodies may bepresent close to the vessel wall.\\n5. CHOREA MINOR.  Chorea minor or Sydenham’s chorea\\nor Saint Vitus’ dance is a delayed manifestation of RF as aresult of involvement of the central nervous system. Thecondition is characterised by disordered and involuntaryjerky movements of the trunk and the extremitiesaccompanied by some degree of emotional instability. Thecondition occurs more often in younger age, particularly ingirls.\\nHistologically,  the lesions are located in the cerebral\\nhemispheres, brainstem and the basal ganglia. Theyconsist of small haemorrhages, oedema and perivascularinfiltration of lymphocytes. There may be endarteritisobliterans and thrombosis of cortical and meningealvessels.\\n6. RHEUMATIC PNEUMONITIS AND PLEURITIS.Involvement of the lungs and pleura occurs rarely in RF.Pleuritis is often accompanied with serofibrinous pleuraleffusion but definite Aschoff bodies are not present. Inrheumatic pneumonitis, the lungs are large, firm andrubbery.Histologically,  the changes are oedema, capillary\\nhaemorrhages and focal areas of fibrinous exudate in thealveoli. Aschoff bodies are generally not found.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES\\nThe first attack of acute RF generally appears 2 to 3 weeks\\nafter streptococcal pharyngitis, most often in children\\nbetween the age of 5 to 15 years. With subsequentstreptococcal pharyngitis, there is reactivation of the disease\\nand similar clinical manifestations appear with each recurrent\\nattack. The disease generally presents with migratory\\npolyarthritis and fever. However, RF has widespread\\nsystemic involvement and no single specific laboratory\\ndiagnostic test is available. As per revised WHO criteria\\n(2004) based on revised Jones’  criteria  (first described by Dr.\\nTD Jones in 1944, and last revised in 1992), following major\\nand minor criteria are included for diagnosis:\\nA.Major criteria:\\n1.Carditis\\n2.\\nPolyarthritis\\n3. Chorea (Sydenham’s chorea)\\n4. Erythema marginatum\\n5. Subcutaneous nodules\\nB. Minor criteria:\\n1. Fever\\n2. Arthralgia\\n3. Previous history of RF4. Laboratory findings  of elevated ESR, raised C-reactive\\nprotein, and leucocytosis\\n5. ECG finding of prolonged PR interval.\\nC. Supportive evidence  of preceding group A streptococcal\\ninfection include: positive throat culture for group A\\nstreptococci, raised titres of streptococcal antibodies\\n(antistreptolysin O and S, antistreptokinase, anti-strepto-\\nhyaluronidase and anti DNAase B).\\nClinical  diagnosis of RF  and RHD is made in a case with\\nantecedent laboratory evidence of streptococcal throat\\ninfection in the presence of any two of the major criteria, or\\noccurrence of one major and two minor criteria.\\nIf the heart is spared in a case of acute RF, the patient\\nmay have complete recovery without any sequelae. However,\\nonce the heart is involved, it is often associated with\\nreactivation and recurrences of the disease. Myocarditis, in\\nparticular, is the most life-threatening due to involvementof the conduction system of the heart and results in serious\\narrhythmias. The long-term sequelae or stigmata  are the\\nchronic valvular deformities, especially the mitral stenosis,as already explained on page 441. Initially, a state of\\ncompensation occurs, while later decompensation of the heart\\nleads to full-blown cardiac failure. Currently, surgical\\nreplacement of the damaged valves can alter the clinicalcourse of the disease.\\nThe major causes of death  in RHD are cardiac failure,\\nbacterial endocarditis and embolism:\\n1.Cardiac failure  is the most common cause of death from\\nRHD. In young patients, cardiac failure occurs due to the444SECTION III Systemic Pathologychronic valvular deformities, while in older patients coronary\\nartery disease may be superimposed on old RHD.\\n2.Bacterial endocarditis  of both acute and subacute type may\\nsupervene due to inadequate use of antibiotics.\\n3.Embolism  in RHD originates most commonly from mural\\nthrombi in the left atrium and its appendages, in association\\nwith mitral stenosis. The organs most frequently affected arethe brain, kidneys, spleen and lungs.\\n4.Sudden death  may occur in RHD as a result of ball\\nthrombus in the left atrium or due to acute coronary\\ninsufficiency in association with aortic stenosis.\\nNON-RHEUMATIC ENDOCARDITIS\\nInflammatory involvement of the endocardial layer of theheart is called endocarditis. Though in common usage, if notspecified endocarditis would mean inflammation of thevalvular endocardium, several workers designateendocarditis on the basis of anatomic area of the involvedendocardium such as: valvular  for valvular endocardium,\\nmural  for inner lining of the lumina of cardiac chambers,\\nchordal  for the endocardium of the chordae tendineae,\\ntrabecular  for the endocardium of trabeculae carneae, and\\npapillary  for the endocardium covering the papillary muscles.\\nEndocarditis can be broadly grouped into non-infective  and\\ninfective  types  (Table 16.6). Most types of endocarditis are\\ncharacterised by the presence of ‘vegetations’ or ‘verrucae’which have distinct features.\\nATYPICAL VERRUCOUS\\n(LIBMAN-SACKS) ENDOCARDITIS\\nLibman and Sacks, two American physicians, described a\\nform of endocarditis in 1924 that is characterised by sterileendocardial vegetations which are distinguishable from thevegetations of RHD and bacterial endocarditis.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Atypical verrucous endocarditis is\\none of the manifestations of  ‘collagen diseases’. Charac-\\nteristic lesions of Libman-Sacks endocarditis are seen in 50%\\ncases of acute systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE);  other\\ndiseases associated with this form of endocarditis aresystemic sclerosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura(TTP) and other collagen diseases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  characteristic\\nvegetations occur most frequently on the mitral andtricuspid valves. The vegetations of atypical verrucousendocarditis are small (1 to 4 mm in diameter), granular,multiple and tend to occur on both surfaces of affectedvalves, in the valve pockets and on the adjoiningventricular and atrial endocardium. The vegetations aresterile unless superimposed by bacterial endocarditis.Unlike vegetations of RHD, the healed vegetations ofLibman-Sacks endocarditis do not produce any significantvalvular deformity. Frequently, fibrinous or serofibrinouspericarditis with pericardial effusion is associated.Microscopically,  the verrucae of Libman-Sacks\\nendocarditis are composed of fibrinoid material withsuperimposed fibrin and platelet thrombi. The endo-cardium underlying the verrucae shows characteristichistological changes which include fibrinoid necrosis,proliferation of capillaries and infiltration by histiocytes,plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils and thepathognomonic  haematoxylin bodies of Gross  which are\\ncounterparts of LE cells of the blood. Similar inflammatorychanges may be found in the interstitial connective tissueof the myocardium. The Aschoff bodies are never foundin the endocardium or myocardium.\\nNON-BACTERIAL THROMBOTIC(CACHECTIC, MARANTIC) ENDOCARDITIS\\nNon-bacterial thrombotic, cachectic, marantic or terminal\\nendocarditis or endocarditis simplex is an involvement ofthe heart valves by sterile thrombotic vegetations.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The exact pathogenesis of lesions\\nin non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is not clear.\\nVegetations are found at autopsy in 0.5 to 5% of cases. Thefollowing diseases and conditions are frequently associatedwith their presence:1.In patients having hypercoagulable state from various\\netiologies e.g. advanced cancer (in 50% case of NBTE)especially mucinous adenocarcinomas, chronic tuberculosis,renal failure and chronic sepsis. In view of its associationwith chronic debilitating and wasting diseases, alternatenames for NBTE such as ‘cachectic’, ‘marantic’ and ‘terminal’endocarditis are used synonymously.2.Occurrence of these lesions in young and well-nourished\\npatients is explained on the basis of alternative hypothesis  such\\nas allergy, vitamin C deficiency, deep vein thrombosis, andendocardial trauma (e.g. due to catheter in pulmonary arteryand haemodynamic trauma to the valves).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the verrucae of\\nNBTE are located on cardiac valves, chiefly mitral, andless often aortic and tricuspid valve. These verrucae areusually small (1 to 5 mm in diameter), single or multiple,brownish and occur along the line of closure of the leafletsbut are more friable than the vegetations of RHD.Organised and healed vegetations appear as fibrousnodules. Normal age-related appearance of tag-likeappendage at the margin of the valve cusps known as‘Lambl’s excrescences’ is an example of such healedlesions.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 16.6: Classification of Endocarditis.\\nA.

Infective or bacterial endocarditis (IE or BE)\\nis serious infection of the valvular and mural endocardium\\ncaused by different forms of microorganisms and ischaracterised by typical infected and friable vegetations. Afew specific forms of IE are named by the microbial etiologicagent causing them e.g. tubercle bacilli, fungi etc. Dependingupon the severity of infection, BE is subdivided into 2 clinicalforms:\\n1.Acute bacterial endocarditis (ABE)  is fulminant and\\ndestructive acute infection of the endocardium by highly\\nvirulent bacteria in a previously normal heart and almostinvariably runs a rapidly fatal course in a period of 2-6 weeks.\\n2.\\nSubacute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) or endocarditis\\nlenta  (lenta  = slow) is caused by less virulent bacteria in a\\npreviously diseased heart and has a gradual downhill course\\nin a period of 6 weeks to a few months and sometimes years.\\nAlthough classification of bacterial endocarditis into acute\\nand subacute forms has been largely discarded because the\\nclinical course is altered by antibiotic treatment, still a fewimportant distinguishing features are worth describing\\n(Table 16.7).  However, features of the vegetations in the two\\nforms of BE are difficult to distinguish.\\nINCIDENCE.  Introduction of antibiotic drugs has helped\\ngreatly in lowering the incidence of BE as compared with its\\nincidence in the pre-antibiotic era. Though BE may occur atany age, most cases of ABE as well as SABE occur over 50years of age. Males are affected more often than females.ETIOLOGY.  All cases of BE are caused by infection with\\nmicroorganisms  in patients having certain predisposing\\nfactors.\\nA.Infective agents.  About 90% cases of BE are caused by\\nstreptococci and staphylococci.\\nIn ABE,  the most common causative organisms are viru-\\nlent strains of staphylococci, chiefly Staphylococcus aureus.\\nOthers are pneumococci, gonococci, β-streptococci and\\nenterococci.\\nIn SABE,  the commonest causative organisms are the\\nstreptococci with low virulence, predominantly Streptococcus\\nviridans,  which forms part of normal flora of the mouth and\\npharynx. Other less common etiologic agents include otherstrains of streptococci and staphylococci (e.g. Streptococcus\\nbovis  which is the normal inhabitant of gastrointestinal tract,\\nStreptococcus pneumoniae,  and Staphylococcus epidermidis  which\\nis a commensal of the skin), gram-negative enteric bacilli (e.g.E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Salmonella ), pneumococci,\\ngonococci and Haemophilus influenzae.\\nB. Predisposing factors.  There are 3 main factors which\\npredispose to the development of both forms of BE:\\n1. Conditions initiating transient bacteraemia, septicaemia\\nand pyaemia.\\n2. Underlying heart disease.3. Impaired host defenses.\\n1.Bacteraemia, septicaemia and pyaemia:  Bacteria gain entrance\\nto the bloodstream causing transient and clinically silent\\nbacteraemia in a variety of day-to-day procedures as well asfrom other sources of infection. Some of the commonexamples are:i) Periodontal infections such as trauma from vigorousbrushing of teeth, hard chewing, tooth extraction and otherdental procedures.ii) Infections of the genitourinary tract such as in catheteri-sation, cystoscopy, obstetrical procedures including normaldelivery and abortions.iii) Infections of gastrointestinal and biliary tract.iv) Surgery of the bowel, biliary tract and genitourinarytracts.v) Skin infections such as boils, carbuncles and abscesses.vi) Upper and lower respiratory tract infections includingbacterial pneumonias.vii) Intravenous drug abuse.viii) Cardiac catheterisation and cardiac surgery forimplantation of prosthetic valves.\\n2.Underlying heart disease:  SABE occurs much more\\nfrequently in previously diseased heart valves, whereas the\\nABE is common in previously normal heart. Amongst thecommonly associated underlying heart diseases are thefollowing:i) Chronic rheumatic valvular disease in about 50% cases.ii) Congenital heart diseases in about 20% cases. Theseinclude VSD, subaortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis,bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and PDA.iii)Other causes are syphilitic aortic valve disease,\\natherosclerotic valvular disease, floppy mitral valve, andprosthetic heart valves.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 16.7: Distinguishing Features of Acute and Subacute\\nBacterial Endocarditis.\\nFeature Acute Subacute\\n1.

Bacteria causing BE on entering the\\nbloodstream from any of the above-mentioned routes are\\nimplanted on the cardiac valves or mural endocardiumbecause they have surface adhesion molecules which mediatetheir adherence to injured endocardium. There are severalpredisposing conditions which explain the development ofbacterial implants on the valves:\\n1. The circulating bacteria are lodged much more frequently\\non previously damaged valves  from diseases, chiefly RHD,\\ncongenital heart diseases and prosthetic valves, than on\\nhealthy valves.\\n2. Conditions producing haemodynamic stress  on the valves\\nare liable to cause damage to the endothelium, favouring\\nthe formation of platelet-fibrin thrombi which get infectedfrom circulating bacteria.\\n3.\\nAnother alternative hypothesis is the occurrence of non-\\nbacterial thrombotic endocarditis  from prolonged stress which\\nis followed by bacterial contamination.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The characteristic patho-\\nlogic feature in both ABE and SABE is the presence of\\ntypical vegetations or verrucae on the valve cusps orleaflets, and less often, on mural endocardium, which arequite distinct for other types. A summary of thedistinguishing features of the principal types of vegetationsis presented in Table 16.8.Grossly,  the lesions are found commonly on the valves of\\nthe left heart, most frequently on the mitral, followed in\\ndescending frequency, by the aortic, simultaneousinvolvement of both mitral and aortic valves, and quiterarely on the valves of the right heart. The vegetations in\\nSABE are more often seen on previously diseased valves,\\nwhereas the vegetations of ABE are often found onpreviously normal valves. Like in RHD, the vegetationsare often located on the atrial surface of atrioventricular\\nvalves and ventricular surface of the semilunar valves.\\nThey begin from the contact areas of the valve and mayextend along the surface of the valves and on to theadjacent endocardium  (Fig. 16.28).\\nThe vegetations  of BE vary in size from a few\\nmillimeters to several centimeters, grey-tawny to greenish,irregular, single or multiple, and typically friable.  They\\nmay appear flat, filiform, fungating or polypoid. The\\nvegetations in ABE tend to be bulkier and globular than\\nthose of SABE and are located more often on previouslynormal valves, may cause ulceration or perforation of theunderlying valve leaflet, or may produce myocardial\\nabscesses.\\nMicroscopically,  the vegetations of BE consist of 3 zones\\n(Fig. 16.29) :\\ni) The outer layer or cap  consists of eosinophilic material\\ncomposed of fibrin and platelets.ii\\n) Underneath this layer is the basophilic zone  containing\\ncolonies of bacteria. However, bacterial component of thevegetations may be lacking in treated cases.\\niii) The deeper zone  consists of non-specific inflamma-\\ntory reaction in the cusp itself, and in the case of SABE\\nthere may be evidence of repair.\\nIn the acute fulminant form of the disease, the inflam-\\nmatory cell infiltrate chiefly consists of neutrophils and is\\nFigure 16.28 Infective endocarditis.

In general, severe\\ncomplications develop early in ABE than in SABE.Complications and sequelae of BE are divided into cardiacand extracardiac (Fig. 16.30):\\nA. Cardiac complications.  These include the following:\\ni)Valvular stenosis or insufficiency\\nii)\\nPerforation, rupture, and aneurysm of valve leaflets\\niii) Abscesses in the valve ringiv) Myocardial abscessesv) Suppurative pericarditis\\nvi) Cardiac failure from one or more of the foregoing\\ncomplications.\\nB. Extracardiac complications.  Since the vegetations in BE\\nare typically friable, they tend to get dislodged due to rapid\\nstream of blood and give rise to embolism which isresponsible for very common and serious extra-cardiac\\ncomplications. These are as under:\\ni) Emboli originating from the left side of the heart  and\\nentering the systemic circulation affect organs like the spleen,kidneys, and brain causing infarcts, abscesses and mycotic\\naneurysms.\\nii) Emboli arising from right side of the heart  enter the\\npulmonary circulation and produce pulmonary abscesses.iii)Petechiae  may be seen in the skin and conjunctiva due to\\neither emboli or toxic damage to the capillaries.iv) In SABE, there are painful, tender nodules on the fingertips of hands and feet called Osler’s nodes,  while in ABE there\\nis appearance of painless, non-tender subcutaneousmaculopapular lesions on the pulp of the fingers calledJaneway’s spots.  In either case, their origin is due to toxic or\\nallergic inflammation of the vessel wall.\\nv)Focal necrotising glomerulonephritis  is seen more commonly\\nin SABE than in ABE. Occasionally diffuse glomerulo-\\nnephritis may occur. Both these have their pathogenesis incirculating immune complexes (hypersensitivityphenomenon) (Chapter 22).\\nTreatment of BE with antibiotics in adequate dosage kills\\nthe bacteria but complications and sequelae of healedendocardial lesions may occur even after successful therapy.The causes of death  are cardiac failure, persistent infection,\\nembolism to vital organs, renal failure and rupture of mycoticaneurysm of cerebral arteries.\\nSPECIFIC TYPES OF INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS\\nBesides BE, various other microbes may occasionally produce\\ninfective endocarditis which are named according to theetiologic agent causing it. These include the following:\\n1.Tuberculous endocarditis.  Though tubercle bacilli are\\nbacteria, tuberculous endocarditis is described separate from\\nthe bacterial endocarditis due to specific granulomatousinflammation found in tuberculosis. It is characterised bypresence of typical tubercles on the valvular as well as muralendocardium and may form tuberculous thromboemboli.\\n2.Syphilitic endocarditis.  The endocardial lesions in\\nsyphilis have already been described in relation to syphilitic\\naortitis on page 401. The severest manifestation ofcardiovascular syphilis is aortic valvular incompetence.\\n3\\n. Fungal endocarditis.  Rarely, endocardium may be\\ninfected with fungi such as from Candida albicans, HistoplasmaFigure 16.30 Complications and sequelae of infective endocarditis.\\n449CHAPTER 16 The Heartcapsulatum, Aspergillus, Mucor , coccidioidomycosis, crypto-\\ncoccosis, blastomycosis and actinomycosis. Opportunistic\\nfungal infections like candidiasis and aspergillosis are seenmore commonly in patients receiving long-term antibiotictherapy, intravenous drug abusers and after prosthetic valvereplacement. Fungal endocarditis produces appearancesimilar to that in BE but the vegetations are bulkier in fungalendocarditis.\\n4. Viral endocarditis.  There is only experimental evidence\\nof existence of this entity.\\n5. Rickettsial endocarditis.  Another rare cause of\\nendocarditis is from infection with rickettsiae in Q fever.\\nVALVULAR DISEASES AND DEFORMITIES\\nValvular diseases are various forms of congenital and\\nacquired diseases which cause valvular deformities. Manyof them result in cardiac failure. Rheumatic heart disease isthe most common form of acquired valvular disease. Valvesof the left side of the heart are involved much more frequentlythan those of the right side of the heart. The mitral valve isaffected most often, followed in descending frequency, bythe aortic valve, and combined mitral and aortic valves. Thevalvular deformities may be of 2 types: stenosis andinsufficiency:\\nStenosis  is the term used for failure of a valve to open\\ncompletely during diastole resulting in obstruction to theforward flow of the blood.\\nInsufficiency or incompetence or regurgitation  is the failure\\nof a valve to close completely during systole resulting in backflow or regurgitation of the blood.\\nThe congenital valvular diseases have already been\\ndescribed (page 425). Various acquired valvular diseases thatmay deform the heart valves are listed below:\\n1. RHD, the commonest cause (page 438)\\n2. Infective endocarditis (page 445)\\n3. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (page 444)4. Libman-Sacks endocarditis (page 444)5. Syphilitic valvulitis (page 401)6. Calcific aortic valve stenosis7. Calcification of mitral annulus\\n8. Myxomatous degeneration (floppy valve syndrome)\\n9. Carcinoid heart disease.The major forms of vegetative endocarditis involving the\\nvalves have already been described. Others along with the\\nconsequences of these valvular diseases in the form ofstenosis and insufficiency of the heart valves are describedbelow.\\nMITRAL STENOSIS\\nMitral stenosis occurs in approximately 40% of all patients\\nwith RHD. About 70% of the patients are women. The latentperiod between the rheumatic carditis and development ofsymptomatic mitral stenosis is about two decades.\\nETIOLOGY.  Mitral stenosis is generally rheumatic in origin.\\nLess common causes include bacterial endocarditis, Libman-\\nSacks endocarditis, endocardial fibroelastosis and congenitalparachute mitral valve.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES . The appearance of the\\nmitral valve in stenosis varies according to the extent ofinvolvement. Generally, the valve leaflets are diffuselythickened by fibrous tissue and/or calcific deposits,especially towards the closing margin. There are fibrousadhesions of mitral commissures and fusion andshortening of chordae tendineae. In less extensiveinvolvement, the bases of the leaflets of mitral valve aremobile while the free margins have puckered andthickened tissue with narrowed orifice; this is called as‘purse-string puckering’.  The more advanced cases have\\nrigid, fixed and immobile diaphragm-like valve leafletswith narrow, slit-like or oval mitral opening, commonlyreferred to as ‘button-hole’  or ‘fish-mouth’  mitral orifice\\n(Fig. 16.31,B).\\nEFFECTS.  In normal adults, the mitral orifice is about 5 cm\\n2.\\nSymptomatic mitral stenosis develops if the valve openingis reduced to 1 cm\\n2 resulting in significant elevation of left\\natrial pressure from the normal of 12 mmHg to about 25mmHg leading to dilatation of the left atrium. The elevatedleft atrial pressure, in turn, raises pressure in the pulmonaryveins and capillaries, reducing the pulmonary function andcausing exertional dyspnoea which is the chief symptom ofmitral stenosis. The effects of mitral stenosis can thus besummarised as under:1. Dilatation and hypertrophy of the left atrium.\\nFigure 16.31 Mitral valve disease. Normal mitral valve (A) contrasted with mitral stenosis (B) and mitral insufficiency (C).\\n450SECTION III Systemic Pathology2. Normal-sized or atrophic left ventricle due to reduced\\ninflow of blood.3. Pulmonary hypertension resulting from passivebackward transmission of elevated left artial pressure whichcauses:\\ni) chronic passive congestion of the lungs;\\nii) hypertrophy and dilatation of the right ventricle; and\\niii) dilatation of the right atrium when right heart failure\\nsupervenes.\\nMITRAL INSUFFICIENCY\\nMitral insufficiency is caused by RHD in about 50% of\\npatients but in contrast to mitral stenosis, pure mitralinsufficiency occurs more often in men (75%). Subsequently,mitral insufficiency is associated with some degree of mitralstenosis.\\nETIOLOGY.  All the causes of mitral stenosis may produce\\nmitral insufficiency, RHD being the most common cause. In\\naddition, mitral insufficiency may result from non-inflammatory calcification of mitral valve annulus (in theelderly), myxomatous transformation of mitral valve (floppyvalve syndrome), rupture of a leaflet or of the chordaetendineae or of a papillary muscle. A few other conditionscause mitral insufficiency by dilatation of the mitral ring suchas in myocardial infarction, myocarditis and left ventricularfailure in hypertension.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The appearance of the\\nmitral valve in insufficiency varies according to theunderlying cause. The rheumatic process producesrigidity, deformity and retraction of the valve leaflets andfusion of commissures as well as shortening and fusionof chordae tendineae (Fig. 16.31,C).\\nIn myxomatous degeneration  of the mitral valve leaflets\\n(floppy valve syndrome) which is described on page 451,there is prolapse of one or both leaflets into the left atriumduring systole.\\nIn non-inflammatory  calcification  of mitral annulus seen\\nin the aged, there is irregular, stony-hard, bead-likethickening in the region of mitral annulus without anyassociated inflammatory changes. It is thought to reflectdegenerative changes of aging.\\nEFFECTS.  The regurgitant mitral orifice produces\\nprogressive increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volumeas well as pressure since the left ventricle cannot emptycompletely. This results in rise in left atrial pressure anddilatation. As a consequence of left atrial hypertension,pulmonary hypertension occurs resulting in pulmonaryoedema and right heart failure. In symptomatic cases ofmitral insufficiency, the major symptoms are related todecreased cardiac output (e.g. fatigue and weakness) anddue to pulmonary congestion (e.g. exertional dyspnoea andorthopnoea) but the features are less well marked than inmitral stenosis. The effects of mitral insufficiency may besummarised as under:1.Dilatation and hypertrophy of the left ventricle.\\n2. Marked dilatation of the left atrium.3.Features of pulmonary hypertension such as:\\ni)\\nchronic passive congestion of the lungs;\\nii) hypertrophy and dilatation of the right ventricle; and\\n iii) dilatation of the right atrium when right heart failure\\nsupervenes.\\nAORTIC STENOSIS\\nAortic stenosis comprises about one-fourth of all patients\\nwith chronic valvular heart disease. About 80% patients ofsymptomatic aortic stenosis are males. It is of 2 main types:non-calcific and calcific type, the latter being more common.\\n1. Non-calcific aortic stenosis.  The most common cause of\\nnon-calcific aortic stenosis is chronic RHD. Other causes are\\ncongenital valvular and subaortic stenosis and congenitallybicuspid aortic valve.\\n2. Calcific aortic stenosis.  Calcific aortic stenosis is more\\ncommon type. Various causes have been ascribed to it. These\\ninclude healing by scarring followed by calcification of aorticvalve such as in RHD, bacterial endocarditis, Brucella\\nendocarditis, Monckeberg’s calcific aortic stenosis (page 392),healed congenital malformation and familial hypercholes-terolaemic xanthomatosis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The aortic cusps show\\ncharacteristic fibrous thickening and calcific nodularityof the closing edges. Calcified nodules are often found inthe sinuses of Valsalva. In rheumatic aortic stenosis, thecommissures are fused and calcified, while in non-rheumatic aortic stenosis there is no commissural fusion(Fig. 16.32,B).\\nFigure 16.32 Aortic valve diseases. Normal aortic valve (A) contrasted with aortic stenosis (B) and aortic insufficiency (C).\\n451CHAPTER 16 The Heartcases (Chapter 20). The lesions are characteristically located\\nin the valves and endocardium of the right side of the heart.The pathogenesis of the cardiac lesions is not certain. But incarcinoid tumour with hepatic metastasis, there is increasedblood level of serotonin secreted by the tumour. Theincreased concentration of serotonin reaches the right sideof the heart and causes the lesions but serotonin is inactivatedon passage of the blood through the lungs and hence the leftheart is relatively spared. In addition, high levels ofbradykinin may play contributory role in carcinoid heartdisease. However, chronic infusion of serotonin or bradykininin experimental animals has not succeeded in producingcardiac lesions; hence the exact pathogenesis of carcinoidheart disease remains obscure.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  In majority of cases, the\\nlesions are limited to the right side of the heart. Bothpulmonary and tricuspid valves as well as the endo-cardium of the right chambers show characteristiccartilage-like fibrous plaques. Similar plaques may occuron the intima of the great veins, the coronary sinus andthe great arteries. Occasionally, the lesions may be foundon the left side of the heart.\\nEFFECTS.  The thickening and contraction of the cusps and\\nleaflets of the valves of the outflow tracts of the right heart\\nresult mainly in pulmonary stenosis and tricuspidregurgitation, and to a lesser extent, pulmonary regurgitation\\nand tricuspid stenosis.\\nMYXOMATOUS DEGENERATION OF MITRAL VALVE\\n(MITRAL  VA\\nLVE PROLAPSE)\\nMyxomatous or mucoid degeneration of the valves of the\\nheart is a peculiar condition occurring in young patientsbetween the age of 20 and 40 years and is more common in\\nwomen. The condition is common and seen in 5% of general\\nadult population. The condition is also known by othersynonyms like ‘floppy valve syndrome’ or ‘mitral valveprolapse’.\\nETIOLOGY.  The cause of the condition is not known but in\\nsome cases it may be genetically determined collagen\\ndisorder. Association with Marfan’s syndrome has beenobserved in 90% of patients. Others have noted myxomatous\\ndegeneration in cases of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and in\\nmyotonic dystrophy. However, the myxomatous valvularchanges seen in the aged patients are not related to this entity.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Any cardiac valve may be\\ninvolved but mitral valve is affected most frequently. Thedisease is usually most severe and most common in theposterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The affected leafletshows either excessi ve or redundant leaflet tissue, which\\nis opaque white, soft and floppy. Cut section of the valve\\nreveals mucoid or myxoid appearance. A significantfeature is the ballooning or aneurysmal protrusion of theaffected leaflet and hence the name ‘mitral valve prolapse’and ‘floppy valve syndrome’.EFFECTS.  Aortic stenosis becomes symptomatic when the\\nvalve orifice is reduced to 1 cm\\n2 from its normal 3 cm2. The\\nsymptoms appear many years later when the heart cannotcompensate and the stenosis is quite severe. The major effectof aortic stenosis is obstruction to the outflow resulting inconcentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Later, whencardiac failure supervenes, there is dilatation as well ashypertrophy of the left ventricle (eccentric hypertrophy).\\nThe three cardinal symptoms  of aortic stenosis are:\\nexertional dyspnoea, angina pectoris and syncope. Exertionaldyspnoea results from elevation of pulmonary capillarypressure. Angina pectoris usually results from elevation ofpulmonary capillary pressure and usually develops due toincreased demand of hypertrophied myocardial mass.Syncope results from accompanying coronary insufficiency.Sudden death may also occur in an occasional case of aorticstenosis.\\nAORTIC INSUFFICIENCY\\nAbout three-fourth of all patients with aortic insufficiency\\nare males with some having family history of Marfan’ssyndrome.\\nETIOLOGY.  In about 75% of patients, the cause is chronic\\nRHD. However, isolated aortic insufficiency is less often due\\nto rheumatic etiology. Other causes include syphiliticvalvulitis, infective endocarditis, congenital subaorticstenosis (congenitally bicuspid aortic valve), myxomatousdegeneration of aortic valve (floppy valve syndrome),\\ntraumatic rupture of the valve cusps, dissecting aneurysm,\\nMarfan’s syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The aortic valve cusps are\\nthickened, deformed and shortened and fail to close. Thereis generally distension and distortion of the ring(Fig. 16.31,C).\\nEFFECTS.  As a result of regurgitant aortic orifice, there is\\nincrease of the left ventricular end-diastolic volume. Thisleads to hypertrophy and dilatation of the left ventricleproducing massive cardiac enlargement so that the heart mayweigh as much as 1000 gm. Failure of the left ventricleincreases the pressure in the left atrium and eventuallypulmonary hypertension and right heart failure occurs.\\nThe characteristic physical findings in a patient of aortic\\ninsufficiency are awareness of the beatings of the heart,poundings in the head with each heartbeat, low diastolic andhigh pulse pressure, rapidly rising and collapsing waterhammer pulse (Corrigan’s pulse), booming ‘pistol shot’sound over the femoral artery, and systolic and diastolicmurmur heard over the femoral artery when it is lightlycompressed (Durozier’s sign). Sometimes, angina pectorisoccurs due to increased myocardial demand or due tocoronary insufficiency.\\nCARCINOID HEART DISEASE\\nETIOLOGY.  Carcinoid syndrome developing in patients\\nwith extensive hepatic metastases from a carcinoid tumour\\nis characterised by cardiac manifestations in about half the452SECTION III Systemic PathologyMicroscopically,  the enlarged cusp shows loose\\nconnective tissue with abundant mucoid or myxoid\\nmaterial due to abundance of mucopolysaccharide.\\nEFFECTS.  Usually the condition does not produce any\\nsymptoms or significant valvular dysfunction. The conditionis recognised during life by the characteristic mid-systolicclick followed by a systolic murmur due to mildlyincompetent mitral valve caused by the mitral valve prolapse.Occasionally, complications may develop such assuperimposed infective endocarditis, mitral insufficiency andarrhythmias. Rarely, sudden death from serious ventriculararrhythmias may occur.\\nMYOCARDIAL DISEASE\\nInvolvement of the myocardium occurs in three major formsof diseases already discussed—ischaemic heart disease,hypertensive heart disease and rheumatic heart disease. Inaddition, there are two other broad groups of isolatedmyocardial diseases:\\nI.Myocarditis  i.e. inflammatory involvement of the\\nmyocardium; and\\nII.Cardiomyopathy  i.e. a non-inflammatory myocardial\\ninvolvement with unknown (primary) or known (secondary)\\netiology.\\nMYOCARDITIS\\nInflammation of the heart muscle is called myocarditis. It is\\na rather common form of heart disease that can occur at anyage. Its exact incidence is difficult to ascertain as thehistological examination has been largely confined to autopsymaterial. Reports from different studies have estimated theincidence of myocarditis in 1 to 4% of all autopsies.\\nA number of classifications of myocarditis have been\\nproposed in the past as follows:\\nInterstitial and parenchymatous type,  depending upon\\nwhether the inflammation is confined to interstitial tissue orthe parenchyma.\\nSpecific and non-specific type, depending upon whether the\\ninflammation is granulomatous or non-specific type.\\nAcute, subacute and chronic type,  depending upon the\\nduration of inflammatory response.\\nHowever, currently most commonly used is etiologic\\nclassification  given in Table 16.9.\\nAccording to this classification, myocarditis is divided\\ninto 4 main etiologic types described below.\\nI. INFECTIVE MYOCARDITIS\\nA number of infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses,\\nprotozoa, parasites, fungi, rickettsiae and spirochaetes maycause myocarditis by direct invasion or by their toxins. Someof the common forms are described below.\\n1. VIRAL MYOCARDITIS.  A number of viral infections\\nare associated with myocarditis. Some of the common\\nexamples are influenza, poliomyelitis, infectious mono-nucleosis, hepatitis, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, mumps,rubella, viral pneumonias, coxsackievirus and HIV infections.Cardiac involvement occurs in about 5% of viral infections.Viral myocarditis usually appears after a few days to a fewweeks of viral infections elsewhere in the body. The damageto the myocardium is caused either by direct viral cytotoxi-city or by cell-mediated immune reaction. Regardless of thetype of virus, the pathologic changes are similar.\\nGrossly,  the myocardium is pale and flabby with dila-\\ntation of the chambers. There may be focal or patchy areasof necrosis.Histologically,  there are changes of acute myocarditis.\\nInitially, there is oedema and infiltration of the interstitialtissue by neutrophils and lymphocytes. Later, there isnecrosis of individual myocardial fibres and the infiltrateconsists of lymphocytes and macrophages.\\n2. SUPPURATIVE MYOCARDITIS.  Pyogenic bacteria,\\nchiefly Staphylococcus aureus  or Streptococcus pyogenes , which\\ncause septicaemia and pyaemia may produce suppurativemyocarditis. As already pointed out, acute bacterialendocarditis may sometimes cause bacterial myocarditis(page 445).\\nGrossly,  There are either abscesses in the myocardium\\nor there is diffuse myocardial involvement.Microscopically,  the exudate chiefly consists of neutro-\\nphils, admixed with lymphocytes, plasma cells andmacrophages. There may be foci of myocardial degene-ration and necrosis with areas of healing by fibrosis.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 16.9: Etiologic Classification of Myocarditis.\\nI. INFECTIVE MYOCARDITIS\\n1.

MISCELLANEOUS TYPES OF MYOCARDITIS\\n1. Physical agents\\n2. Chemical agents3. Drugs\\n4. Immunologic agents\\n5. Metabolic derangements453CHAPTER 16 The Heart3. TOXIC MYOCARDITIS.  A number of acute bacterial\\ninfections produce myocarditis by toxins e.g. in diphtheria,\\ntyphoid fever and pneumococcal pneumonia.\\nGrossly,  the appearance is similar to that seen in viral\\nmyocarditis.Histologically,  there are small foci of coagulative necrosis\\nin the muscle which are surrounded by nonspecific acuteand chronic inflammatory infiltrate.\\nToxic myocarditis manifests clinically by cardiac\\narrhythmias or acute cardiac failure due to involvement ofthe conduction system. It may cause sudden death.\\n4. INFECTIVE GRANULOMATOUS MYOCARDITIS.\\nTuberculosis, brucellosis and tularaemia are some examplesof bacterial infections characterised by granulomatousinflammation in the myocardium. Sarcoidosis, though not abacterial infection, has histological resemblance to othergranulomatous myocarditis. Tuberculous myocarditis is rareand occurs either by haematogenous spread or by extensionfrom tuberculous pericarditis. The condition must bedistinguished from idiopathic granulomatous (giant cell)myocarditis (described later).\\n5. SYPHILITIC MYOCARDITIS.  Syphilitic involvement of\\nthe myocardium may occur in 2 forms—a gummatous  lesion\\nconsisting of granulomatous inflammation which is more\\ncommon, and a primary  non-specific myocarditis  which is rare.\\nThe syphilitic gummas in the myocardium may be single ormultiple and may be grossly discernible. The gummas mayaffect the conduction system of the heart.\\n6. RICKETTSIAL MYOCARDITIS.  Myocarditis occurs\\nquite frequently in scrub typhus ( R. tsutsugamushi ) and Rocky\\nMountain typhus fever caused by spotted rickettsii.\\nMicroscopically,  there is interstitial oedema and focal or\\npatchy infiltration by inflammatory cells which include\\nlymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, mast cells andeosinophils but necrosis and degeneration are generallynot present.\\n7. PROTOZOAL MYOCARDITIS.  Chagas’ disease and\\ntoxoplasmosis are the two protozoal diseases causingmyocarditis. Chagas’ disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi\\nfrequently attacks myocardium besides involving the skeletalmuscle and the central nervous system. Toxoplasmosiscaused by intracellular protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii,\\nsometimes causes myocarditis in children and adults.\\nMicroscopically,  both these conditions show focal\\ndegeneration and necrosis of the myocardium, oedemaand cellular infiltrate consisting of histiocytes, plasmacells, lymphocytes and a few polymorphs.The organismsare found in the muscle fibres.\\n8. HELMINTHIC MYOCARDITIS.  Echinococcus granulosus\\nand Trichinella spiralis  are the two intestinal helminths which\\nmay cause myocarditis. Echinococcus  rarely produces hydatid\\ncyst in the myocardium while the larvae of Trichinella  in\\ntrichinosis cause heavy inflammation in the myocardium aswell as in the interstitial tissue.9. FUNGAL MYOCARDITIS.  Patients with immuno-\\ndeficiency, cancer and other chronic debilitating diseases aremore prone to develop fungal myocarditis. These include:candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, actinomyosis,cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis.\\nII. IDIOPATHIC (FIEDLER’S) MYOCARDITIS\\nIdiopathic or Fiedler’s myocarditis is an isolated myocarditis\\nunaccompanied by inflammatory changes in theendocardium or pericardium and occurs without the usualapparent causes. The condition is rapidly progressive andcauses sudden severe cardiac failure or sudden death.\\nGrossly,  the heart is soft and flabby. The cardiac chambers\\nare generally dilated and sometimes show hypertrophy.There are yellow-grey focal lesions throughout themyocardium. Mural thrombi are commonly present.\\nHistologically,  two forms of idiopathic myocarditis are\\ndescribed: diffuse type and giant cell (idiopathic\\ngranulomatous) type.i)Diffuse type  is more common of the two. It is\\ncharacterised by diffuse non-specific inflammatory infil-trate consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macro-phages, eosinophils and a few polymorphs in the inter-stitial tissue without formation of granulomas. Late stageshows healing by fibrosis.i\\ni) Giant cell type or idiopathic granulomatous type  is\\ncharacterised by formation of non-caseating granulomasconsisting of macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells andmultinucleate giant cells. The giant cells are of foreignbody or Langhans’ type or of myogenic origin. Thegranulomas do not show presence of acid-fast bacilli orspirochaetes. Some have suggested relationship of thiscondition with sarcoidosis but sarcoid granulomas areknown to occur in the myocardium secondary togeneralised sarcoidosis.\\nIII. MYOCARDITIS IN CONNECTIVE  TISSUE  DISEASES\\nInflammatory involvement of the myocardium occurs in a\\nnumber of connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoidarthritis, lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa,dermatomyositis and scleroderma. The pathologic changesin the heart muscle are similar to the changes seen in otherorgans in these conditions as described elsewhere in relevantchapters.\\nIV. MISCELLANEOUS TYPES OF MYOCARDITIS\\nApart from the above forms of myocarditis, miscellaneous\\ngroup consists of myocarditis caused by a variety of agents—physical and chemical agents, drugs and metabolicderangements.\\n1. Physical agents.  Physical agents like contusion of the\\nmyocardium, heat stroke, cardiac surgery and irradiation can\\ninitiate non-specific myocarditis. The features consist of aninfiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cellsand shows contraction-band necrosis of the myocardialfibres.454SECTION III Systemic Pathology2. Chemical agents.  Toxic chemicals such as arsenic, phos-\\nphorus and carbon monoxide cause focal areas of\\ndegeneration and necrosis of myocardial fibres and non-specific inflammatory reaction, chiefly consisting oflymphocytes and macrophages.\\n3. Drugs.  Changes similar to those induced by chemical\\npoisons are produced by certain drugs such as phenothiazine\\ncompounds, sulfonamides, catecholamines and cytotoxiccompounds.\\n4. Immunologic agents.  Myasthenia gravis, Friedreich’s\\nataxia, and progressive muscular dystrophies initiate a state\\nof autoimmunisation against the myocardium resulting infocal myocardial degeneration and necrosis with secondaryinflammatory reaction. Later, there may be myocardialfibrosis.\\n5. Metabolic derangements.  Uraemia, hypokalaemia and\\nshock are associated with degeneration and necrosis of the\\nmyocardial fibres, oedema of the interstitial tissue and non-specific inflammatory reaction.\\nCARDIOMYOPATHY\\nCardiomyopathy literally means disease of the heart muscle\\nbut the term was originally coined to restrict its usage tomyocardial disease of unknown cause.  The WHO definition of\\ncardiomyopathy also excludes heart muscle diseases ofknown etiologies. However, the term cardiomyopathy hasbeen loosely used by various workers for myocardial diseasesof known etiology as well e.g. alcoholic cardiomyopathy,amyloid cardiomyopathy, ischaemic cardiomyopathy etc.This controversy is resolved by classifying all cardiomyo-pathies into two broad groups:a)primary cardiomyopathy ; and\\nb)secondary cardiomyopathy  i.e. myocardial disease with\\nknown underlying cause.\\nBased on these principles, a classification of primary\\ncardiomyopathy and its subtypes is presented in Table 16.10.\\nA. PRIMAR Y\\n CARDIOMYOPATHY\\nThis is a group of myocardial diseases of unknown cause. Itis subdivided into the following 3 pathophysiologiccategories (Fig. 16.33):\\n1. Idiopathic dilated (congestive) cardiomyopathy.2.Idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\\n3.Idiopathic restrictive or obliterative or infiltrative\\ncardiomyopathy.\\nIdiop\\nathic Dilated (Congestive) Cardiomyopathy\\nThis type of cardiomyopathy is characterised by gradually\\nprogressive cardiac failure along with dilatation of all thefour chambers of the heart. The condition occurs more oftenin adults and the average survival from onset to death is lessthan 5 years. Though the etiology is unknown, a fewhypotheses based on associations with the followingconditions have been proposed:\\ni) Possible association of viral myocarditis  (especially\\ncoxsackievirus B) with dilated cardiomyopathy, due to\\npresence of viral nucleic acids in the myocardium, has beennoted.\\nii)Association with toxic damage  from cobalt and\\nchemotherapy with doxorubicin and other anthracyclines is\\nimplicated in some cases.\\niii) Inherited mutations  have been implicated due to occurrence\\nof disease in families. Mutations in certain sarcomere proteins\\nsuch as cardiac troponin-T and I, β-and α-myosin, and\\nα-cardiac actin have been observed. Abnormality in protein\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 16.10: Classification of Primary Cardiomyopathies.\\n1. Idiopathic dilated (or congestive) cardiomyopathy\\n2.

Another\\nmutation in cytoskeletal protein dystrophin gene onX-chromosome has been held responsible for muscular\\ndystrophy as well as dilated cardiomyopathy.\\niv) Chronic alcoholism  has been found associated with dilated\\ncardiomyopathy. It may be due to thiamine deficiency\\ninduced by alcohol and resulting in beri-beri heart disease(Chapter 9). This is referred to as ‘alcoholic cardiomyopathy’and included by some workers as one of the subtypes ofsecondary cardiomyopathy. However, moderate consump-\\ntion of alcohol provides some cardioprotection against IHD\\nby raising HDL cholesterol. Another form of alcoholiccardiomyopathy is associated with consumption of largequantities of beer (beer drinkers’ myocardiosis). Cobalt addedto the beer so as to improve the appearance of foam is thoughtto cause direct toxic injury to the heart in this condition.\\nv)Peripartum association  has been observed in some cases.\\nPoorly-nourished women may develop this form of\\ncardiomyopathy within a month before or after delivery(peripartum cardiomyopathy).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the heart is en-\\nlarged and increased in weight (up to 1000 gm). The mostcharacteristic feature is prominent dilatation of all the fourchambers giving the heart typical globular appearance.Thickening of the ventricular walls even if present ismasked by the ventricular dilatation (Fig. 16.33,A).  The\\nendocardium is thickened and mural thrombi are oftenfound in the ventricles and atria. The cardiac valves areusually normal.Microscopically,  The endomyocardial biopsies or autopsy\\nexamination of the heart reveal non-specific and variablechanges. There may be hypertrophy of some myocardial\\nfibres and atrophy of others. Sometimes degenerative\\nchanges and small ar eas of interstitial fibrosis are found\\nwith focal mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate.\\nIdiop athic Hypertrophic Cardiomyop\\nathy\\nThis form of cardiomyopathy is known by various synonymslike asymmetrical hypertrophy, hypertrophic subaortic\\nstenosis and Teare’s disease. The disease occurs more\\nfrequently between the age of 25 and 50 years. It is often\\nasymptomatic but becomes symptomatic due to heavyphysical activity causing dyspnoea, angina, congestive heart\\nfailure and even sudden death. Though idiopathic, following\\nfactors have been implicated:\\ni)Autosomal dominant inheritance  of the disease is available\\nin about half the cases suggesting genetic factors in its\\ncausation.\\nii)Inherited mutations  in genes encoding for sarcomere\\nproteins have been reported in much larger number of cases\\nof hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than those of dilated\\ncardiomyopathy. Particularly implicated are the mutationsin heavy and light chains of cardiac β -myosin, troponin-I and\\ntroponin-T. The condition may result from myocardial\\nischaemia  resulting in\\n fibrosis of the intramyocardial arteries\\nand compensatory hypertrophy.iii) Other contributory factors  are: increased circulating level\\nof catecholamines, myocardial ischaemia as a result of\\nthickened vasculature of the myocardium and abnormallyincreased fibrous tissue in the myocardium due tohypertrophy.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the characteristic\\nfeatures are cardiac enlargement, increase in weight,normal or small ventricular cavities and myocardialhypertrophy. The hypertrophy of the myocardium istypically asymmetrical and affects the interventricularseptum more than the free walls of the ventricles(Fig. 16.33,B). This asymmetric septal hypertrophy may\\nbe confined to the apical region of the septum ( non-\\nobstructive type ) or may extend up to the level of the mitral\\nvalve causing obstruction to left ventricular outflow inthe form of subaortic stenosis ( obstructive type ). The\\ndesignation of rhabdomyoma  of the septum  was applied to\\nthis form of cardiomyopathy in the old literature.Microscopically,  the classical feature is the myocardial\\ncell disorganisation in the ventricular septum. The bundlesof myocardial fibres are irregularly and haphazardlyarranged rather than the usual parallel pattern and areseparated by bands of interstitial fibrous tissue. Theindividual muscle cells show hypertrophy and largeprominent nuclei.\\nIdiopathic Restrictive (Obliterative or Infiltrative)Cardiomyop athy\\nThis form of cardiomyopathy is characterised by restrictionin ventricular filling due to reduction in the volume of theventricles. The common feature in this heterogeneous groupof conditions producing restrictive cardiomyopathy isabnormal diastolic function. Restrictive cardiomyopathyincludes the following entities:\\ni)Cardiac amyloidosis\\nii\\n) Endocardial fibroelastosis\\niii) Endomyocardial fibrosisiv) Löeffler’s endocarditis (Fibroplastic parietal endocarditis\\nwith peripheral blood eosinophilia)\\nv)  Other forms of restrictive cardiomyopathy.\\nI) CARDIAC AMYLOIDOSIS.  Amyloidosis of the heart\\nmay occur in any form of systemic amyloidosis or may occur\\nas isolated organ amyloidosis in amyloid of aging and resultin subendocardial deposits (Chapter 4).\\nII\\n) ENDOCARDIAL FIBROELASTOSIS.  This is an\\nunusual and uncommon form of heart disease occurringpredominantly in infants and children under 2 years of ageand less often in adults. The infantile form  is clinically\\ncharacterised by sudden breathlessness, cyanosis, cardiacfailure and death whereas the symptoms in the adult form\\nlast for longer duration. The etiology of the condition remainsobscure. However, a number of theories have been proposed.These are as under:\\na)The infantile form is believed to be congenital in origin\\noccurring due to the effect of intrauterine endocardial anoxia.\\nThe adult form may also be induced by anoxia-causing456SECTION III Systemic Pathologylesions such as anomalous coronary arteries, metabolic\\nderangements influencing myocardial function etc.\\nb) It may occur due to haemodynamic pressure overload  such\\nas in congenital septal defects and coarctation of the aorta.\\nc) It may be an expression of genetic disorder  as noticed in\\ntwins, triplets and siblings. Association of endocardial\\nfibroelastosis with various congenital malformations in theheart or elsewhere further supports the genetic theory.\\nd) Some workers consider this disease a form of  connective\\ntissue disorder.\\ne) Certain factors causing myocardial injury  may initiate the\\nendocardial disease such as in thiamine deficiency (beri-beri\\nheart disease) or from preceding idiopathic myocarditis.\\nf)Lymphatic obstruction  of the heart has been suggested by\\nsome as the causative mechanism.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the characteristic\\nfeature is the diffuse or patchy, rigid, pearly-white\\nthickening of the mural endocardium (Fig. 16.33,C).  Left\\nventricle is predominantly involved, followed indecreasing frequency by the left atrium, right ventricleand right atrium. Quite often, the valves, especially of theleft heart, are affected. Some cases contain mural thrombi.Enlargement of the heart is present and is mainly due toleft ventricular hypertrophy but the volume of thechamber is decreased.Microscopically,  the typical finding is the proliferation\\nof the collagen and elastic tissue (fibroelastosis)comprising the thickened endocardium. The fibroelastosis\\ngenerally does not extend into the subjacent myocardium.\\nThe lesion is devoid of inflammatory cells.\\nIII) ENDOMYOCARDIAL FIBROSIS.  This form of\\nrestrictive cardiomyopathy is a tropical condition prevalentin Africa, especially in Uganda and Nigeria, but some casesoccur in South India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and tropical SouthAmerica. It is seen in children and young adults. The clinicalmanifestations consist of congestive heart failure of unknowncause just as in adult variety of endocardial fibroelastosis.The etiology of the condition remains obscure but thegeographic distribution suggests the role of certain factorslike malnutrition, viral infections and heavy consumptionof banana (rich in serotonin).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  endomyocardial\\nfibrosis is characterised by fibrous scarring of the ventri-cular endocardium that extends to involve the inner thirdof the myocardium. The atrioventricular valve leaflets areoften affected but the semilunar valves are uninvolved.Mural thrombi may be present. The heart may be normal-sized or hypertrophied but the volume of the affectedchambers is diminished due to fibrous scarring.\\nMicroscopically,  the endocardium and parts of inner third\\nof the myocardium show destruction of normal tissue and\\nreplacement by fibrous tissue. The condition differs fromendocardial fibroelastosis in having mononuclearinflammatory cell infiltrate and lacking in elastic tissue.The superficial layer may show dense hyalinisedconnective tissue and even calcification.IV) LÖEFFLER’S ENDOCARDITIS.  Also known by the\\nmore descriptive term of ‘fibroplastic parietal endocarditis\\nwith peripheral blood eosinophilia’, the condition is\\nconsidered by some as a variant of the entity described above,\\nendomyocardial fibrosis. However, it differs from the latterin following respects:\\na)There is generally a peripheral blood eosinophilic\\nleucocytosis.b\\n) The inflammatory infiltrate in the endocardium and in\\nthe part of affected myocardium chiefly consists of\\neosinophils.\\nc) The condition has a worse prognosis.\\nV) OTHER FORMS OF RESTRICTIVE CARDIOMYO-\\nPATHY.  Besides above, restrictive cardiomyopathy may\\nresult from various diverse causes as under:\\ni) Haemochromatosis due to iron overload from multiple\\ntransfusions, haemoglobinopathies.ii) Myocardial sarcoidosis.iii) Carcinoid syndrome.iv)  Scleroderma.v) Neoplastic infiltration in the heart.\\nB. SECONDARY CARDIOMYOPATHY\\nThis is a group of myocardial diseases of known etiologies\\nor having clinical associations. This, however, excludes well-defined entities such as ischaemic, hypertensive, valvular,pericardial, congenital and inflammatory involvements of theheart. The main entities included in this group are described\\nelsewhere in the text and are listed below:\\n1.Nutritional disorders e.g.  chronic alcoholism, thiamine\\ndeficiency causing beri-beri heart disease (Chapter 9).2.Toxic chemicals e.g . cobalt, arsenic, lithium and\\nhydrocarbons.3.Drugs  e.g. cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, cate-\\ncholamines.4.Metabolic diseases e.g.  amyloidosis, haemochromatosis,\\nglycogen storage diseases, hypo-and hyperthyroidism, hypo-and hyperkalaemia.5.Neuromuscular diseases e.g.  Friedreich’s ataxia, muscular\\ndystrophies.\\n6.Infiltration s e.g. from leukaemia and carcinoma.\\n7.Connective tissue diseases e.g.  rheumatoid arthritis, syste-\\nmic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, lupus erythematosus.\\nPERICARDIAL DISEASE\\nDiseases of the pericardium are usually secondary to, orassociated with, other cardiac and systemic diseases. Theyare broadly of 2 types:I. Pericardial fluid accumulationsII. Pericarditis\\nPERICARDIAL FLUID ACCUMULATIONS\\nAccumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac may be watery\\nor pure blood. Accordingly, it is of 2 types: hydropericardium(pericardial effusion) and haemopericardium.457CHAPTER 16 The HeartA. HYDROPERICARDIUM (PERICARDIAL EFFUSION).\\nAccumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity due to non-inflammatory causes is called hydropericardium orpericardial effusion. Normally, the pericardial cavity contains30 to 50 ml of clear watery fluid. Considerable quantities offluid (up to 1000 ml) can be accommodated in the pericardialcavity without seriously affecting the cardiac function if theaccumulation is slow. But sudden accumulation of a smallervolume (up to 250 ml) may produce deficient diastolic fillingof the cardiac chambers (cardiac tamponade). Pericardialeffusion is detected by cardiac enlargement in the X-rays andby faint apex beat.\\nThe various types of effusions and their causes are as\\nfollows:\\n1.Serous effusions.  This is the most common type\\noccurring in conditions in which there is generalised oedema\\ne.g. in cardiac (in CHF), renal, nutritional and hepatic causes.The serous effusion is clear, watery, straw-coloured withspecific gravity less than 1.015 (transudate). The serosalsurface is smooth and glistening.\\n2.\\nSerosanguineous effusion.  This type is found following\\nblunt trauma to chest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\\n3. Chylous effusion.  Milky or chylous fluid accumulates\\nin conditions causing lymphatic obstruction.\\n4. Cholesterol effusion.  This is a rare type of fluid accumu-\\nlation characterised by the presence of cholesterol crystals\\nsuch as in myxoedema.\\nB. HAEMOPERICARDIUM.  Accumulation of pure blood\\nin the pericardial sac is termed haemopericardium. The\\ncondition must be distinguished from haemorrhagicpericarditis in which there is escape of small quantities ofblood into the pericardial cavity. Massive and suddenbleeding into the sac causes compression of the heart leadingto cardiac tamponade. The causes of haemopericardium areas under:\\ni)Rupture of the heart through a myocardial infarct.\\nii\\n) Rupture of dissecting aneurysm.\\niii) Bleeding diathesis such as in scurvy, acute leukaemias,\\nthrombocytopenia.\\niv) Trauma following cardiopulmonary resuscitation or by\\nlaceration of a coronary artery.\\nPERICARDITIS\\nPericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardial layers and\\nis generally secondary to diseases in the heart or caused bysystemic diseases. Primary or idiopathic pericarditis is quiterare. Based on the morphologic appearance, pericarditis isclassified into acute and chronic types, each of which mayhave several etiologies. Acute and chronic pericarditis hasfurther subtypes based on the character of the exudate(Table 16.11).\\nA.Acute Pericarditis\\nAcute bacterial and non-bacterial pericarditis are the most\\nfrequently encountered forms of pericarditis. These may havethe following subtypes:1.\\nSEROUS PERICARDITIS.  Acute pericarditis may be\\naccompanied by accumulation of serous effusion whichdiffers from transudate of hydropericardium in havingincreased protein content and higher specific gravity. Itsvarious causes are as under:i)Viral infection e.g. coxsackie A or B viruses, influenza\\nvirus, mumps virus, adenovirus and infectious mono-nucleosis.ii\\n) Rheumatic fever.\\niii) Rheumatoid arthritis.iv) Systemic lupus erythematosus.v) Involvement of the pericardium by malignant tumour inthe vicinity e.g. carcinoma lung, mesothelioma andmediastinal tumours.vi) Tuberculous pericarditis in the early stage.\\nThe fluid accumulation is generally not much and ranges\\nfrom 50 to 200 ml but may rarely be large enough to causecardiac tamponade.\\nMicroscopically,  the epicardial and pericardial surfaces\\nshow infiltration by some neutrophils, lymphocytes andhistiocytes. The fluid usually resorbs with the resolutionof underlying disease.\\n2. FIBRINOUS AND SEROFIBRINOUS PERICARDITIS.The response of the pericardium by fibrinous exudate is themost common type of pericarditis. Quite often, there isadmixture of fibrinous exudate with serous fluid. The variouscauses of this type of pericarditis are as follows:i)Uraemia\\nii\\n) Myocardial infarction\\niii) Rheumatic feveriv) Trauma such as in cardiac surgeryv) Acute bacterial infections.\\nThe amount of fluid accumulation is variable. The cardiac\\nsurface is characteristically covered by dry or moist, shaggy,fibrinous exudate which gives ‘bread and butter’ appearance.Clinically, these cases manifest by friction rub. In lessextensive cases of fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis,there is complete resorption of the exudate. In cases withadvanced fibrinous exudate, pericarditis heals byorganisation and develops fibrous adhesions resulting inadhesive pericarditis.\\n3. PURULENT OR FIBRINOPURULENT PERICARDI-\\nTIS.  Purulent or fibrinopurulent pericarditis is mainly caused\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 16.11: Classification of Pericarditis.\\nA. ACUTE PERICARDITIS\\n1. Serous pericarditis\\n2\\n. Fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis\\n3. Purulent or fibrinopurulent pericarditis\\n4. Haemorrhagic pericarditis\\nB. CHRONIC PERICARDITIS\\n1. Tuberculous pericarditis2. Chronic adhesive pericarditis3. Chronic constrictive pericarditis4. Pericardial plaques (milk spots, soldiers’ spots)458SECTION III Systemic Pathologyby pyogenic bacteria (e.g. staphylococci, streptococci and\\npneumococci) and less frequently by fungi and parasites. Theinfection may spread to the pericardium by the followingroutes:i) By direct extension from neighbouring inflammation e.g.in empyema of the pleural cavity, lobar pneumonia, infectiveendocarditis and mediastinal infections.ii) By haematogenous spread.iii) By lymphatic permeation.iv) Direct implantation during cardiac surgery.\\nGenerally, fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis precedes\\nthe development of purulent pericarditis. The amount ofexudate is variable and is generally thick, creamy pus, coatingthe pericardial surfaces.\\nMicroscopically,  besides the purulent exudate on the\\npericardial surfaces, the serosal layers show denseinfiltration by neutrophils (Fig. 16.34).  Purulent exudate\\ngenerally does not resolve completely but instead healsby organisation resulting in adhesive or chronicconstrictive pericarditis.\\n4. HAEMORRHAGIC PERICARDITIS.  Haemorrhagic\\npericarditis is the one in which the exudate consists ofadmixture of an inflammatory effusion of one of the foregoingtypes alongwith blood. The causes are as under:\\ni)Neoplastic involvement of the pericardium\\nii)\\nHaemorrhagic diathesis with effusion\\niii) Tuberculosis\\niv) Severe acute infections\\nThe outcome of haemorrhagic pericarditis is generally\\nsimilar to that of purulent pericarditis.\\nB. Chronic Pericarditis\\nChronic pericarditis is the term used for tuberculous\\npericarditis and the healed stage of one of the various formsof acute pericarditis already described. Included under thisare: tuberculous pericarditis, chronic adhesive perica rditis,\\nchronic constrictive pericarditis, and the pericardial plaques.\\n1.TUBERCULOUS PERICARDITIS.  Tuberculous peri-\\ncarditis is the most frequent form of granulomatous\\ninflammation of the pericardium. The lesions may occur byone of the following mechanisms:\\ni)\\nDirect extension from an adjacent focus of tuberculosis.\\nii)\\nBy lymphatic spread e.g. from tracheobronchial lymph\\nnodes, chronic pulmonary tuberculosis or infected pleura.\\nThe exudate is slightly turbid, caseous or blood-stained\\nwith sufficient fibrin. Tubercles are generally visible on the\\npericardial surfaces and sometimes caseous areas are alsovisible to the naked eye.\\nMicroscopically,  typical tuberculous granulomas with\\ncaseation necrosis are seen in the pericardial wall. Thelesions generally do not resolve but heal by fibrosis andcalcification resulting in chronic constrictive pericarditis.\\n2. CHRONIC ADHESIVE PERICARDITIS.  Chronic\\nadhesive pericarditis is the stage of organisation and healingby formation of fibrous adhesions in the pericardiumfollowing preceding fibrinous, suppurative or haemorrhagicpericarditis. The process begins by formation of granulationtissue and neovascularisation. Subsequently, fibrousadhesions develop between the parietal and the viscerallayers of the pericardium and obliterate the pericardial space(Fig. 16.35,A).  Sometimes, fibrous adhesions develop\\nbetween the parietal pericardium and the adjacentmediastinum and is termed as adhesive mediastinopericarditis.\\nChronic adhesive pericarditis differs from chronicconstrictive pericarditis in not embarrassing the function ofthe heart. However, cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation mayoccur in severe cases due to increased workload.\\n3. CHRONIC CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS.  This is\\na rare condition characterised by dense fibrous or fibrocalcific\\nthickening of the pericardium resulting in mechanicalinterference with the function of the heart and reducedcardiac output. The condition usually results from a long-standing preceding causes, e.g.i)Tuberculous pericarditis\\nii)\\nPurulent pericarditis\\niii) Haemopericardiumiv) Concato’s disease (polyserositis)v) Rarely, acute non-specific and viral pericarditis.\\nThe heart is encased in 0.5 to 1 cm thick and dense\\ncollagenous scar which may be calcified. As a result, the heartfails to dilate during diastole. The dense fibrocollagenoustissue may cause narrowing of the openings of the venacavae, resulting in obstruction to the venous return to theright heart and consequent right heart failure. In contrast tochronic adhesive pericarditis, hypertrophy and dilatation donot occur due to dense fibrous scarring. Instead, the heartsize is normal or smaller (Fig. 16.35,B).\\n4. PERICARDIAL PLAQUES (MILK SPOTS, SOLDIERS’\\nSPOTS). These are opaque, white, shining and well-\\ncircumscribed areas of organisation with fibrosis in theFigure 16.34 Fibrinopurulent pericarditis. The pericardium is covered\\nwith pink serofibrinous exudates. The space between the layers of the\\npericardium contains numerous inflammatory cells, chiefly PMNs.\\n459CHAPTER 16 The Heartpericardium measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter. They are seen\\nmost frequently on the anterior surface of the right ventricle.The exact cause is not known but they are generally believedto arise from healing of preceding pericarditis. The plaque-like lesions of pericardial thickenings are also termed milk\\nspots or soldiers’ spots  as they were often found at autopsy in\\nthe soldiers in World War I who carried their shoulder bagscausing pressure against the chest wall by the straps whichproduced chronic irritation of the pericardium.\\nTUMOURS OF THE HEART\\nTumours of the heart are classified into primary andsecondary, the latter being more common than the former.\\nPRIMARY TUMOURS\\nPrimary tumours of the heart are quite rare, found in 0.04%\\nof autopsies. In decreasing order of frequency, the benigntumours encountered in the heart are: myxoma, lipoma,fibroelastoma, rhabdomyoma, haemangioma and lymph-angioma. The malignant tumours are still rarer, the importantones are: rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma and malignantmesothelioma. Out of all these, only myxoma of the heartrequires elaboration.\\nMYXOMA.  This is the most common primary tumour of the\\nheart comprising about 50% of all primary cardiac tumours.\\nMajority of them occur in the age range of 30 to 60 years.Myxomas may be located in any cardiac chamber or thevalves, but 90% of them are situated in the left atrium.\\nGrossly,  they are often single but may be multiple. They\\nrange in size from less than 1 to 10 cm, polypoid, pedun-culated, spherical, soft and haemorrhagic massesresembling an organising mural thrombus. Someinvestigators actually consider them to be organisingmural thrombi rather than true neoplasms.Microscopically,  the tumour shows the following features:\\ni) There is abundant myxoid or mucoid intercellular\\nstroma positive for mucin.ii) The cellularity is sparse. The tumour cells are generally\\nstellate-shaped, spindled and polyhedral, scattered in theFigure 16.35 Appearance of the heart and the pericardium in chronic\\nadhesive (A) and chronic constrictive pericarditis (B).stroma. Occasional multinucleate tumour giant cells arepresent.iii) Numerous capillary-sized blood vessels are found andthe tumour cells may be aggregated around them.iv) A few lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages areseen.v) Foci of haemorrhage and deposits of haemosideringranules are often present.\\nSECONDARY TUMOURS\\nMetastatic tumours of the heart are more common than the\\nprimary tumours. About 10% cases with disseminated cancerhave metastases in the heart. Most of these result fromhaematogenous or lymphatic spread. In descending orderof frequency, primary sites of origin are: carcinoma of thelung, breast, malignant lymphoma, leukaemia and malignantmelanoma. Occasionally, there may be direct extension of aprimary intrathoracic tumour such as carcinoma of the lunginto the pericardium and into the cardiac chambers.\\nPATHOLOGY OF CARDIOVASCULAR\\nINTERVENTIONS\\nNowadays, with the development of surgical and non-surgical coronary revascularisation procedures in coronaryartery disease, it has been possible to study the pathology ofnative as well as grafted vessel. However, these invasivetherapeutic interventions are done in conjunction with lifestyle changes for modifying the risk factors. Besides, themyocardial tissue by endomyocardial biopsy is alsoaccessible for histopathologic study.\\nENDOMYOCARDIAL BIOPSY\\nCurrently, it is possible to perform endomyocardial biopsy\\n(EMB) for making a final histopathologic diagnosis in certaincardiac diseases. The main indications  for EMB are:\\nmyocarditis, cardiac transplant cases, restrictive heartdisease, infiltrative heart diseases such as in amyloidosis,storage disorders etc.\\n EMB is done by biopsy forceps introduced via cardiac\\ncatheter into either of the ventricles but preferably rightventricle is biopsied for its relative ease and safety. The routefor the catheter may be through internal jugular vein orfemoral vein for accessing the right ventricle.\\nBALLOON ANGIOPLASTY\\nBalloon angioplasty or percutaneous coronary intervention\\n(PCI) is a non-surgical procedure that employs percutaneousinsertion and manipulation of a balloon catheter into theoccluded coronary artery. The balloon is inflated to dilatethe stenotic artery which causes endothelial damage, plaquefracture, medial dissection and haemorrhage in the affectedarterial wall. PCI is accompanied with insertion of coronarystents in the blocked coronaries with a success rate ofsymptoms in over 95% cases. However, case selection forPCI is important and major indications are 2 or 3 vessel block\\n460SECTION III Systemic Pathologybut blockage of left main coronary is a contraindication for\\nPCI. Unstable angioplasty may be associated with acute\\ncoronary syndromes. PCI is followed by administration of\\nanti-platelet (oral aspirin) and antithrombin therapy to avoidoccurrence of coronary thrombosis.\\nRecurrent stenosis after metal stenting in PCI may occur\\nwithin 6 months in about 20% patients, more often in patientsof diabetes mellitus. Restenosis is multifactorial in etiologythat includes smooth muscle cell proliferation, extracellularmatrix and local thrombosis. However, widespread use of\\ndrug-delivering stents has made it possible to overcome\\nseveral long-term complications of coronary stening.Currently, stents  with anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory,cytotoxic and cytostatic agents are commercially available.\\nCORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING\\nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) employs the use of\\nautologous grafts to replace or bypass the blocked coronaryarteries. Most frequently used is autologous graft ofsaphenous vein which is reversed (due to valves in the vein)\\nand transplanted, or left internal mammary artery may be\\nused being in the operative area of the heart. Long-termfollow-up of CABG surgery has yielded following obser-vations on pathology of grafted vessel:\\n1.In a reversed saphenous vein graft, long-term luminal\\npatency is 50% after 10 years. Pathologic changes which\\ndevelop in grafted vein  include thrombosis in early stage,\\nintimal thickening and graft atherosclerosis with or without\\ncomplicated lesions.2.\\nInternal mammary artery graft, however, has a patency\\nof more than 90% after 10 years.\\n3. Atherosclerosis with superimposed complications may\\ndevelop in native coronary artery distal to the grafted vesselas well as in the grafted vessel.\\nCARDIAC  TRANSPLANTATION\\nSince the first human-to-human cardiac transplant was\\ncarried out successfully by South African surgeon DrChristian Barnard in 1967, cardiac transplantation andprolonged assisted circulation is being done in manycountries in end-stage cardiac diseases, most often inidiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure and IHD.Worldwide, about 3,000 cardiac transplants are performedannually. The survival following heart transplants is reportedas: 1 year in 85%, 5 years in 65% and 10 years in 45% cases.Major complications are transplant rejection reaction,infections (particularly with Toxoplasma gondii  and\\ncytomegaloviruses), graft coronary atherosclerosis andhigher incidence of malignancy due to long-term adminis-tration of immunosuppressive therapy. One of the mainproblems in cardiac transplant centres is the availability ofdonors.\\nThe concept of cardiac stem cells resident in the heart\\nand possibly of bone marrow stem cells transdifferentiatinginto cardiac myocyte has generated interest in treatment ofpatients of IHD with transplantation of these stem cells.Preliminary studies in IHD cases have yielded encouragingresults in clinical improvement and reduction in infarct size\\nand hold promise for future.\\n❑461CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory SystemLUNGS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nANATOMY.  The normal adult right lung weighs 375 to 550\\ngm (average 450 gm) and is divided by two fissures into three\\nlobes—the upper, middle and lower lobes. The weight of thenormal adult left lung is 325 to 450 gm (average 400 gm) and\\nhas one fissure dividing it into two lobes—the upper andlower lobes, while the middle lobe is represented by thelingula. The airways of the lungs arise from the trachea byits division into right and left main bronchi which continueto divide and subdivide further, eventually terminating intothe alveolar sacs (Fig. 17.1) .\\nThe right main bronchus is more vertical so that aspirated\\nforeign material tends to pass down to the right lung ratherthan to the left. The trachea, major bronchi and theirbranchings possess cartilage, smooth muscle and mucousglands in their walls, while the bronchioles have smoothmuscle but lack cartilage as well as the mucous glands.Between the tracheal bifurcation and the smallest bronchi,about 8 divisions take place. The bronchioles so formed further\\nundergo 3 to 4 divisions leading to the terminal bronchioles\\nwhich are less than 2 mm in diameter. The part of the lungtissue distal to a terminal bronchiole is called an acinus.  A\\ncluster of about 5 acini supplied by terminal bronchioles andenclosed by visible fibrous septa is termed as the pulmonary\\nlobule. An acinus  consists of 3 parts:\\n1.Several (usually 3 to 5 generations) respiratory bronchioles\\noriginate from a terminal bronchiole.\\n2. Each respiratory bronchiole divides into several alveolar\\nducts.\\n3.Each alveolar duct opens into many alveolar sacs (alveoli)\\nwhich are blind ends of the respiratory passages.\\nThe lungs have double blood supply—oxygenated blood\\nfrom the bronchial arteries and venous blood from the\\npulmonary arteries, and there is mixing of the blood to someextent. In case of blockage of one side of circulation, thesupply from the other can maintain the vitality of pulmonaryparenchyma. The bronchial veins drain the blood suppliedby the bronchial arteries. The lungs have abundantintercommunicating lymphatics on the surface which draininto the subpleural plexus. Hilar and tracheobronchial lymphnodes receive the lymph and drain into the thoracic duct.\\nHISTOLOGY.  The bronchi and their subdivisions up to\\nbronchioles are lined by pseudostratified columnar ciliated\\nepithelial cells, also called respiratory epithelium.  These cells\\nare admixed with mucus-secreting goblet cells whichdecrease in number as the bronchioles are approached. Themucosa of bronchi contains numerous submucosal mucousglands and neuroendocrine cells which are bronchial counter-parts of the argentaffin cells of the alimentary tract(Chapter 20). The structure of bronchioles differs from thatof bronchi and its subdivisions as well as from alveoli. Theyare lined by a single layer of pseudostratified columnarciliated epithelium but no mucus cells and hence, unlike thebronchi, contain no mucus secretion on the surface. Theycontain some nonciliated Clara cells which secrete proteinrich in lysozyme and immunoglobulins but unlike the alveolicontain no surfactant.\\nThe alveolar walls or alveolar septa  are the sites of\\nexchange between the blood and air and have the followingmicroscopic features (Fig. 17.2) :\\n1.The capillary endothelium  lines the anastomotic capillaries\\nin the alveolar walls.2.The capillary endothelium and the, alveolar lining\\nepithelial cells are separated by the capillary basement\\nmembrane and some interstitial tissue.  The interstitial tissue\\nconsists of scanty amount of collagen, fibroblasts, fine elasticfibres, smooth muscle cells, a few mast cells and mononuclearcells.3.\\nThe alveolar epithelium  consists of 2 types of cells: type I  or\\nmembranous pneumocytes  are the most numerous covering\\nThe Respiratory System Chapter 17Chapter 17\\nFigure 17.1 The structure of an acinus which is part of the lung\\ndistal to terminal bronchiole. It shows respiratory bronchiole, alveolar\\nducts and alveolar sacs.\\n462SECTION III Systemic Pathologyabout 95% of alveolar surface, while type II  or granular\\npneumocytes project into the alveoli and are covered by\\nmicrovilli. Type II pneumocytes are essentially reserve cells\\nwhich undergo compensatory hyperplasia when type Ipneumocytes are injured and are also the source ofpulmonary surfactant rich in lecithin. The main functions ofcoating of surfactant are to lower the surface tension of thealveolar lining cells and in maintaining the stability of thealveoli.4. The alveolar macrophages  belonging to mononuclear-\\nphagocyte system are present either free in the alveolarspaces or are attached to the alveolar cells.5. The pores of Kohn  are the sites of alveolar connections\\nbetween the adjacent alveoli and allow the passage of bacteriaand exudate.\\nFUNCTIONS.  The primary functions of lungs is oxygenation\\nof the blood and removal of carbon dioxide. The respiratory\\ntract is particularly exposed to infection as well as to thehazards of inhalation of pollutants from the inhaled air andcigarette smoke. There exists a natural mechanism of filteringand clearing of such pollutants through respiratoryepithelium, tracheobronchial lymphatics and alveolarmacrophages. Besides, the lungs are the only other organafter heart through which all the blood of the body passesduring circulation. Therefore, cardiovascular diseases haveserious effects on the lungs, and conversely, diseases of thelungs which interfere with pulmonary blood flow havesignificant effects on the heart and systemic circulation.\\nFollowing groups of diseases of the respiratory tract are\\nstudied in this chapter:1. Paediatric lung disease (congenital and acquired)2. Pulmonary vascular disease3. Pulmonary infections4. Chronic obstructive pulomonary disease5. Chronic restrictive pulmonary disease6. Tumours of lungs.\\nPAEDIATRIC LUNG DISEASE\\nA number of congenital anomalies (e.g. agenesis, hypoplasia,\\nheterotopic tissue, vascular anomalies, tracheal and bronchialanomalies, congenital pulmonary overinflation or lobaremphysema, congenital cysts and bronchopulmonarysequestration) and certain neonatal acquired lung diseases(respiratory distress syndrome or hyaline membrane disease,bronchopulmonary dysplasia, meconium aspirationsyndrome, persistent foetal circulation, atelactasis, collapseand bronchiolitis) have been described. Some of theimportant conditions from point of view of pathology arediscussed below.\\nCONGENITAL CYSTS\\nDevelopmental defects involving deficiency of bronchial or\\nbronchiolar cartilage, elastic tissue and muscle result incongenital cystic disease of lungs. A single large cyst of thistype occupying almost a lobe is called pneumatocele. Multiple\\nsmall cysts are more common and give sponge-likeappearance to the lung. The cysts are thin-walled and dilatedand generally lined by flattened ciliated epithelium overlyinga thin layer of supportive connective tissue. These cysts maycontain air or may get infected and become abscesses. Cystsmay rupture into bronchi producing haemoptysis, or intothe pleural cavity producing pneumothorax.\\nBRONCHOPULMONARY SEQUESTRATION\\nSequestration is the presence of lobes or segments of lung\\ntissue which are not connected to the airway system. Theblood supply of the sequestered area is not from thepulmonary arteries but from the aorta or its branches.Sequestration may be intralobar or extralobar.\\nIntralobar sequestration  is the sequestered broncho-\\npulmonary mass within the pleural covering of the affectedlung.\\nExtralobar sequestration  is the sequestered mass of lung\\ntissue lying outside the pleural investing layer such as in thebase of left lung or below the diaphragm. The extralobarsequestration is predominantly seen in infants and childrenand is often associated with other congenital malformations.\\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME\\n(HYALINE MEMBRANE DISEASE)\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe, at\\ntimes life-threatening, form of progressive respiratoryinsufficiency which involves pulmonary tissues diffusely i.e.involvement of the alveolar epithelium, alveolar lumina andinterstitial tissue. ARDS exists in 2 forms: neonatal and adulttype. Both have the common morphological feature offormation of hyaline membrane in the alveoli and hence isFigure 17.2 Histologic structure of alveolar wall (alveolar septa). It\\nshows capillary endothelium, capillary basement membrane and scanty\\ninterstitial tissue and the alveolar lining cells (type I or membranouspneumocytes and type II or granular pneumocytes).\\n463CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory Systemalso termed as hyaline membrane disease (HMD). The two\\nforms of ARDS have different clinical settings, response totreatment and consequences, etiology, pathogenesis but havesimilar morphology, and hence are discussed together below.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES AND CONSEQUENCES.  These are\\nas under:\\nNeonatal ARDS  occurring in newborn infants begins\\nwith dyspnoea within a few hours after birth with\\ntachypnoea, hypoxia and cyanosis; in severe cases death mayoccur within a few hours.\\nAdult ARDS  is known by various synonyms such as\\nshock-lung syndrome, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), acutealveolar injury, traumatic wet lungs and post-traumaticrespiratory insufficiency. The condition was first recognisedin adults during World War II in survivors of non-thoracicinjuries with shock. Adult ARDS also presents clinically bysudden and severe respiratory distress, tachypnoea,tachycardia, cyanosis and severe hypoxaemia.\\nETIOLOGY.  The two forms of ARDS have distinct etiology:\\nNeonatal ARDS  is primarily initiated by hypoxia, either\\nshortly before birth or immediately afterward. It occurs in\\nfollowing clinical settings:1. Preterm infants2. Infants born to diabetic mothers3. Delivery by caesarean section4. Infants born to mothers with previous premature infants5. Excessive sedation of the mother causing depression inrespiration of the infant6. Birth asphyxia from various causes such as coils ofumbilical cord around the neck7. Male preponderance (1.5 to 2 times) over female babiesdue to early maturation of female lungs8. Finally, many cases of neonatal ARDS remain idio-pathic.\\nAdult ARDS  may occur from the following causes:\\n1. Shock due to sepsis, trauma, burns2. Diffuse pulmonary infections, chiefly viral pneumonia3. Pancreatitis4. Oxygen toxicity5. Inhalation of toxins and irritants e.g. smoke, war gases,nitrogen dioxide, metal fumes etc.6. Narcotic overdose7. Drugs e.g. salicylates, colchicine8. Aspiration pneumonitis9. Fat embolism10. Radiation.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  In both neonatal and adult type ARDS,\\nthere is damage to alveolocapillary wall triggered by etiologic\\nfactors listed above, and the final pathologic consequence offormation of hyaline membrane is also similar. However,how it occurs is different in the neonates than in adults. Thesequence of events in the pathogenesis of both neonatal andadult ARDS is schematically illustrated in Fig. 17.3  and is\\noutlined below:\\nNeonatal ARDS.  Entry of air into alveoli is essential for\\nformation of hyaline membrane i.e. dead born infants do not developHMD.i) The basic defect in neonatal ARDS is a deficiency of\\npulmonary surfactant , normally synthesised by type II alveolar\\ncells. The production of surfactant is normally increased\\nshortly before birth but in prematurity and in neonatalhypoxia from any of the foregoing causes, its synthesis isdecreased. The main function of alveolar surfactant being\\nlowering of alveolar surface tension, its deficiency leads to\\nincreased alveolar surface tension which in turn causesatelectasis .\\nii) Atelectasis of the lungs results in hypoventilation, pulmo-nary hypoperfusion and ischaemic damage to capillaryendothelium.\\niii) This results in ischaemic necrosis of the alveolocapillary\\nwall, exudation of plasma proteins including fibrinogen into\\nthe alveoli and eventually formation of hyaline membraneon the alveolar surface containing largely fibrin.\\nAdult ARDS.  The mechanism of acute injury by etiologic\\nagents listed above depends upon the  imbalance between pro-\\ninflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines:\\ni) Activated pulmonay macrophages release proinflammatory\\ncytokines  such as IL8, IL1, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF),\\nwhile macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) helps to sustain\\ninflammation in the alveoli. Number of neutrophils in thealveoli is increased in acute injury. Neutrophils on activation\\nrelease products which cause active tissue injury e.g.\\nproteases, platelet activating factor, oxidants andleukotrienes.\\nii) Besides the role of cytokines in acute injury, a few fibrogenic\\ncytokines such as transforming growth factor- α (TGF- α) and\\nplatelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) play a role in repair\\nprocess by stimulation of proliferation of fibroblast and\\ncollagen.\\nIn either case, injury to the capillary endothelium leads\\nto increased vascular permeability while injuredpneumocytes, especially type 1, undergo necrosis. The neteffect of injury to both capillary endothelium and alveolarepithelium is interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema,congestion, fibrin deposition and formation of hyalinemembranes. As a result of coating of the alveoli with hyalinemembranes, there is loss of surfactant causing collapse called‘stiff lung’. There is an attempt at regeneration of alveolarcells by proliferation of type II alveolar cells so as to increasethe secretion of surfactant.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the lungs are\\nnormal in size. They are characteristically stiff, congested,heavy  and airless so that they sink in water.Microscopically,  the important features are as follows\\n(Fig. 17.4) :\\n1.There is presence of collapsed alveoli (atelectasis) alter-\\nnating with dilated alveoli.2.\\nNecrosis of alveolar epithelial cells and formation of\\ncharacteristic eosinophilic hyaline membranes lining therespiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and the proximalalveoli. The membrane is largely composed of fibrinadmixed with cell debris derived from necrotic alveolarcells.3. Interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema, congestion andintra-alveolar haemorrhages.464SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\n4. Changes of bronchopneumonia may supervene.\\n5. With time, compensatory proliferation of pneumocytesinto alveolar lumen may be seen as tufts of alveolarepithelium.6. In organising stage, there is interstitial fibrosisobliterating alveolar spaces.\\nCONSEQUENCES.  ARDS in both neonates and adults can\\nhave following consequences:Figure 17.3 Schematic representation of sequence of events leading to the formation of hyaline membrane in neonatal and adult acute\\nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\\nFigure 17.4 Histological appearance of hyaline membrane disease. There are alternate areas of collapsed and dilated alveolar spaces, many\\nof which are lined by eosinophilic hyaline membranes.\\n465CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory System1. Death.  The mortality rate in neonatal ARDS is high (20 to\\n30%) and is still higher in babies under 1 kg of body weight.\\nThe stiff lung in adult ARDS fails to respond to oxygentherapy and is acutely serious and severe respiratory problemwhich may be fatal.\\n2. Resolution.  Milder cases of neonatal ARDS recover with\\nadequate oxygen therapy by ventilator-assist methods in a\\nfew days, while in adult ARDS control of the trigger whichinitiated it may result in resolution. The hyaline membraneis liquefied by the neutrophils and macrophages and thusabsorbed. The cell debris in alveolar lumina are cleared bythe macrophages and restore the normal aeration of thealveoli.\\n3. Other sequelae.  Besides the two extremes—death and\\nrecovery, other long-term sequelae of ARDS are as under:\\ni) Some cases of neonatal ARDS who recover may developbronchopulmonary dysplasia  later on.\\nii) In both neonatal and adult ARDS, there may be develop-ment of desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP)  due to\\npneumocytes  proliferation supervened with inflammation.iii) Patients of adult ARDS who survive acute episodes maydevelop widespread interstitial fibrosis later and progressto diffuse fibrosing alveolitis (Hamman Rich syndrome).\\nBRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA\\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia occurs as a complication in\\ninfants treated for neonatal ARDS with oxygen and assistedventilation. The toxicity of oxygen and barotrauma from highpressure of oxygen give rise to subacute or chronic fibrosingcondition of the lungs termed bronchopulmonary dysplasia.The condition is clinically characterised by persistence ofrespiratory distress for upto 3 to 6 months.\\nMicroscopically,  there is organisation of hyaline memb-\\nranes resulting in fibrous thickening of the alveolar walls,bronchiolitis, peribronchial fibrosis, and development ofemphysema due to alveolar dilatation. Many bronchiolesshow squamous metaplasia.\\nATELECTASIS AND COLLAPSE\\nAtelectasis in the newborn or primary atelectasis is defined as\\nincomplete expansion of a lung or part of a lung, while\\npulmonary collapse or secondary atelectasis is the term used\\nfor reduction in lung size of a previously expanded and well-aerated lung. Obviously, the former occurs in newbornwhereas the latter may occur at any age.\\nATELECTASIS. Stillborn infants have total atelectasis, while\\nthe newborn infants with weak respiratory action develop\\nincomplete expansion of the lungs and clinical atelectasis.The common causes are prematurity, cerebral birth injury,CNS malformations and intrauterine hypoxia.\\nGrossly,  the lungs are small, dark blue, fleshy and non-\\ncrepitantMicroscopically,  the alveolar spaces in the affected area\\nare small with thick interalveolar septa. The alveolarspaces contain proteinaceous fluid with a few epithelialsquames and meconium. Scattered aerated areas of thelung are hyperinflated causing interstitial emphysema andpneumothorax.\\nCOLLAPSE.  Pulmonary collapse or secondary atelectasis in\\nchildren and adults may occur from various causes such ascompression, obstruction, contraction and lack of pulmonarysurfactant. Accordingly, collapse may be of the followingtypes:\\n1.Compressive collapse.  Pressure from outside causes\\ncompressive collapse e.g. by massive pleural effusion,\\nhaemothorax, pneumothorax, intrathoracic tumour, highdiaphragm and spinal deformities. Compressive collapseinvolves subpleural regions and affects lower lobes more thanthe central areas.\\n2\\n. Obstructive/absorptive collapse.  Obstruction of a\\nbronchus or many bronchioles causes absorption of oxygen\\nin the affected alveoli followed by collapse e.g. by viscidmucus secretions in bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis,bronchiectasis, bronchial tumours and aspiration of foreignbodies. Obstructive collapse is generally less severe than thecompressive collapse and is patchy.\\n3. Contraction collapse.  This type occurs due to localised\\nfibrosis in lung causing contraction followed by collapse.\\nBRONCHIOLITIS AND BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS\\nBronchiolitis and bronchiolitis obliterans are the inflam-\\nmatory conditions affecting the small airways occurringpredominantly in older paediatric age group and in quiteelderly persons. A number of etiologic factors have beenstated to cause this condition. These include viral infection(frequently adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus),bacterial infection, fungal infection, inhalation of toxic gases(e.g. in silo-fillers’ disease) and aspiration of gastric contents.\\nMicroscopically,  the lumina of affected bronchioles are\\nnarrow and occluded by fibrous plugs. The bronchiolarwalls are inflamed and are infiltrated by lymphocytes andplasma cells. There are changes of interstitial pneumonitisand fibrosis in the alveoli around the affected bronchioles.\\nSUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME\\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib death is an\\nuncommon condition seen mainly in the western countries.It affects infants in the age group of 2 to 6 months. Thecondition is seen in premature babies born to mothers whohave been smokers and indulged in drug abuse.\\nMicroscopically,  at autopsy the upper respiratory airways\\nand lungs invariably show petechial haemorrhages.\\nPULMONARY VASCULAR DISEASE\\nAs stated before, diseases of the heart affect the lungs and\\ndiseases of the lungs affect the heart. This is because of thepeculiar characteristics of pulmonary vasculature. Thepressure in the pulmonary arteries is much lower than inthe systemic arteries. The pulmonary arterial system is466SECTION III Systemic Pathologythinner than the systemic arterial system. They are thin elastic\\nvessels which can be easily distinguished from thick-walledbronchial arteries supplying the large airways and the pleura.\\nGeneral diseases of vascular origin occurring in the lungs\\nsuch as pulmonary oedema, pulmonary congestion,pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infarction, have allbeen already discussed in Chapter 5. The other importantdisease of pulmonary alveocapillary wall, ARDS, has alreadybeen discussed above. Here, an account of pulmonaryhypertension is given.\\nPULMONARY HYPERTENSION\\nNormally, the pulmonary arterial circulation is high-flow and\\nlow-pressure system with much lower blood pressure thanthe systemic blood pressure; it does not exceed 30/15 mmHgeven during exercise (normally, bloo d pressure in the\\npulmonary veins is between 3 and 8 mmHg). Pulmonaryhypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure in thepulmonary arterial circulation above 30 mmHg. Pulmonaryhypertension is broadly classified into 2 groups: primary(idiopathic) and secondary; the latter being more common.\\nPrimary (Idiop athic) Pulmonary Hypertension\\nPrimary or idiopathic pulmonary hypertension is an\\nuncommon condition of unknown cause. The diagnosis canbe established only after a thorough search for the usualcauses of secondary pulmonary hypertension (discussedbelow). The patients are usually young females between theage of 20 and 40 years, or children around 5 years of age.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Though the etiology of primary\\npulmonary hypertension is unknown, a number of etiologic\\nfactors have been suggested to explain its pathogenesis:\\n1.A neurohumoral vasoconstrictor mechanism may be invol-\\nved leading to chronic vasoconstriction that induces\\npulmonary hypertension.\\n2.\\nThe occurrence of disease in young females has promp-\\nted a suggestion that unrecognised thromboemboli  or amniotic\\nfluid emboli  during pregnancy may play a role.\\n3. There is a suggestion that primary pulmonary hyper-\\ntension may be a form of collagen vascular disease.  This is\\nsupported by occurrence of Raynaud’s phenomenonpreceding the onset of this disease by a number of years inmany patients, and disease association with SLE, sclerodermaand rheumatoid arthritis.\\n4.Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease  characterised by fibrous\\nobliteration of small pulmonary veins is believed to be\\nresponsible for some cases of primary pulmonaryhypertension, especially in children. This is generallyconsidered a consequence of thrombosis or vasculitis.\\n5.Ingestion of substances  like ‘bush tea’, oral contraceptives\\nand appetite depressant agents like aminorex are believed\\nto be related to primary pulmonary hypertension.\\n6.Familial occurrence  has been reported in a number of cases.\\nSecondary Pulmonary Hypertension\\nWhen pulmonary hypertension occurs secondary to a\\nrecognised lesion in the heart or lungs, it is termed assecondary pulmonary hypertension. It is the more commontype and may be encountered at any age, but more frequentlyover the age of 50 years.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Based on the underlying\\nmechanism, causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension\\nare divided into the following 3 groups:\\nA.Passive pulmonary hypertension.  This is the commonest\\nand is produced by diseases raising pressure in the\\npulmonary veins e.g.1.\\nMitral stenosis.\\n2. Chronic left ventricular failure (e.g. in severe systemichypertension, aortic stenosis, myocardial fibrosis).\\nB. Hyperkinetic (Reactive) pulmonary hypertension.  In\\nthis group are included causes in which the blood enters the\\npulmonary arteries in greater volume or at a higher pressure.For example:1. Patent ductus arteriosus.2. Atrial or ventricular septal defects.\\nC. Vaso-occlusive pulmonary hypertension. All such\\nconditions which produce progressive diminution of the\\nvascular bed in the lungs are included in this group. Vaso-occlusive causes may be further sub-divided into 3 types:\\n1.Obstructive type,  in which there is block in the pulmonary\\ncirculation e.g.\\ni) Multiple emboli or thrombiii) Sickle cell disease\\niii) Schistosomiasis\\n2.Obliterative type,  in which there is reduction of pulmo-\\nnary vascular bed by chronic parenchymal lung diseases e.g.\\ni) Chronic emphysemaii) Chronic bronchitisiii) Bronchiectasisiv) Pulmonary tuberculosisv) Pneumoconiosis\\n3.Vasoconstrictive type,  in which there is widespread and\\nsustained hypoxic vasoconstriction and alveolar hyper-\\nventilation leading to pulmonary hypertension e.g.\\ni) In residents at high altitude\\nii) Pathologic obesity (Pickwickian disease)iii) Upper airway disease such as tonsillar hypertrophy\\niv) Neuromuscular diseases such as poliomyelitisv) Severe kyphoscoliosis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Irrespective of the type of\\npulmonary hypertension (primary or secondary), chronic\\ncases invariably lead to cor pulmonale (Chapter 16). Thepathologic changes are confined to the right side of theheart and pulmonary arterial tree in the lungs. There ishypertrophy of the right ventricle and dilatation of theright atrium. The vascular changes are similar in primaryand secondary types and involve the entire arterial treefrom the main pulmonary arteries down to the arterioles.These changes are as under (Fig. 17.5) :\\n1.Arterioles and small pulmonary arteries: These\\nbranches show most conspicuous changes. These are asfollows:i)\\nMedial hypertrophy.467CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory Systemii) Thickening and reduplication of elastic laminae.\\niii) Plexiform pulmonary arteriopathy in which there isintraluminal tuft of capillary formation in dilated thin-walled arterial branches. These lesions are not so markedin secondary pulmonary hypertension.\\n2. Medium-sized pulmonary arteries:\\ni) Medial hypertrophy, which is not so marked insecondary pulmonary hypertension.ii) Concentric intimal thickening.iii) Adventitial fibrosis.iv) Thickening and reduplication of elastic laminae.\\n3. Large pulmonary arteries:\\ni) Atheromatous deposits.\\nPULMONARY INFECTIONS\\nAcute and chronic pulmonary infections are common at all\\nages and are a frequent cause of death. They are generallycaused by a wide variety of microorganisms such as bacteria,viruses, fungi and mycoplasma. Important and commonexamples of acute pulmonary infectious diseases discussedhere are pneumonias, lung abscess  and fungal infections,  while\\npulmonary tuberculosis,  generally regarded as an example of\\nchronic lung infections, is discussed in Chapter 6.\\nPNEUMONIAS\\nPneumonia is defined as acute inflammation of the lung\\nparenchyma distal to the terminal bronchioles (consisting ofthe respiratory bronchiole, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs andalveoli). The terms ‘pneumonia’ and ‘pneumonitis’ are oftenused synonymously for inflammation of the lungs, while‘consolidation’ (meaning solidification) is the term used forgross and radiologic appearance of the lungs in pneumonia.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The microorganisms gain entry into the\\nlungs by one of the following four routes:\\n1.Inhalation  of the microbes present in the air.2.Aspiration  of organisms from the nasopharynx or\\noropharynx.3.Haematogenous spread  from a distant focus of infection.\\n4.Direct spread  from an adjoining site of infection.\\nThe normal lung is free of bacteria because of the presence\\nof a number of lung defense mechanisms at different levelssuch as nasopharyngeal filtering action, mucociliary actionof the lower respiratory airways, the presence ofphagocytosing alveolar macrophages and immunoglobulins.Failure of these defense mechanisms and presence of certainpredisposing factors result in pneumonias. These conditionsare as under:\\n1. Altered consciousness.  The oropharyngeal contents may\\nbe aspirated in states causing unconsciousness e.g. in coma,\\ncranial trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular accidents, drugoverdose, alcoholism etc.\\n2.\\nDepressed cough and glottic reflexes.  Depression of\\neffective cough may allow aspiration of gastric contents e.g.\\nin old age, pain from trauma or thoracoabdominal surgery,neuromuscular disease, weakness due to malnutrition,kyphoscoliosis, severe obstructive pulmonary diseases,endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy.\\n3. Impaired mucociliary transport.  The normal protection\\noffered by mucus-covered ciliated epithelium in the airways\\nfrom the larynx to the terminal bronchioles is impaired ordestroyed in many conditions favouring passage of bacteriainto the lung parenchyma. These conditions are cigarettesmoking, viral respiratory infections, immotile ciliasyndrome, inhalation of hot or corrosive gases and old age.\\n4. Impaired alveolar macrophage function. Pneumonias\\nmay occur when alveolar macrophage function is impaired\\ne.g. by cigarette smoke, hypoxia, starvation, anaemia,pulmonary oedema and viral respiratory infections.\\n5. Endobronchial obstruction.  The effective clearance\\nmechanism is interfered in endobronchial obstruction from\\ntumour, foreign body, cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis.Figure 17.5 Histologic changes in the pulmonary arterial branches of different sizes in pulmonary hypertension.\\n468SECTION III Systemic Pathology6. Leucocyte dysfunctions.  Disorders of lymphocytes\\nincluding congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies (e.g.\\nAIDS, immunosuppressive therapy) and granulocyteabnormalities may predispose to pneumonia.\\nCLASSIFICATION.  On the basis of the anatomic part of the\\nlung parenchyma involved, pneumonias are traditionally\\nclassified into 3 main types:1.Lobar pneumonia\\n2.Bronchopneumonia (or Lobular pneumonia)\\n3.\\nInterstitial pneumonia.\\nHowever, now that much is known about etiology and\\npathogenesis of pneumonias, current practice is to follow theetiologic classification (Table 17.1)  which divides pneu-\\nmonias into following 3 main groups:A. Bacterial pneumonia\\nB.\\nViral pneumonia\\nC. Pneumonias from other etiologies.\\nIn the present discussion, a combined approach of\\netiologic and morphologic classification will be followed.\\nA. BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA\\nBacterial infection of the lung parenchyma is the most\\ncommon cause of pneumonia or consolidation of one or boththe lungs. Two types of acute bacterial pneumonias aredistinguished—lobar pneumonia and broncho-(lobular-)pneumonia, each with distinct etiologic agent andmorphologic changes. Another type distinguished by someworkers separately is confluent pneumonia  which combines\\nthe features of both lobar and bronchopneumonia andinvolves larger (confluent) areas in both the lungs irregularly,while others consider this as a variant of bronchopneumonia.\\nLobar Pneumonia\\nLobar pneumonia is an acute bacterial infection of a part of a\\nlobe, the entire lobe, or even two lobes of one or both thelungs.\\nETIOLOGY.  Based on the etiologic microbial agent causing\\nlobar pneumonia, following types of lobar pneumonia are\\ndescribed:\\n1.Pneumococcal pneumonia.  More than 90% of all lobar\\npneumonias are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,\\na lancet-shaped diplococcus. Out of various types,type 3-S. pneumoniae causes particularly virulent form of lobar\\npneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia in majority of cases\\nis community-acquired infection.\\n2.\\nStaphylococcal pneumonia.  Staphylococcus aureus  causes\\npneumonia by haematogenous spread of infection from\\nanother focus or after viral infections.\\n3. Streptococcal pneumonia.  β-haemolytic streptococci may\\nrarely cause pneumonia such as in children after measles or\\ninfluenza, in severely debilitated elderly patients and indiabetics.\\n4. Pneumonia by gram-negative aerobic bacteria.  Less\\ncommon causes of lobar pneumonia are gram-negative\\nbacteria like Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae\\n(Friedlander’s bacillus), Pseudomonas, Proteus  and Escherichia\\ncoli, H. influenzae  commonly causes pneumonia in children\\nbelow 3 years of age after a preceding viral infection.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Laennec’s original\\ndescription divides lobar pneumonia into 4 sequentialpathologic phases: stage of congestion  (initial phase), red\\nhepatisation (early consolidation), grey hepatisation  (late\\nconsolidation) and resolution.  However, these classic stages\\nseen in untreated cases are found much less oftennowadays due to early institution of antibiotic therapyand improved medical care.\\nIn lobar pneumonia, as the name suggests, part of a\\nlobe, a whole lobe, or two lobes are involved, sometimesbilaterally. The lower lobes are affected most commonly.The sequence of pathologic changes described belowrepresents the inflammatory response of lungs in bacterialinfection.\\n1. STAGE OF CONGESTION: INITIAL PHASE\\n(Fig. 17.6,A) . The initial phase represents the early acute\\ninflammatory response to bacterial infection and lasts for\\n1 to 2 days.Grossly,  the affected lobe is enlarged, heavy, dark red and\\ncongested. Cut surface exudes blood-stained frothy fluid.Histologically,  typical features of acute inflammatory\\nresponse to the organisms are seen. These are as under(Fig. 17.7) :\\ni)Dilatation and congestion of the capillaries in the\\nalveolar walls.i\\ni) Pale eosinophilic oedema fluid in the air spaces.\\niii) A few red cells and neutrophils in the intra-alveolarfluid.iv) Numerous bacteria demonstrated in the alveolar fluidby Gram’s staining.\\n2. RED HEPATISATION: EARLY CONSOLIDATION\\n(Fig. 17.6,B) . This phase lasts for 2 to 4 days. The term\\nhepatisation in pneumonia refers to liver-like consistencyof the affected lobe on cut section.Grossly,  the affected lobe is red, firm and consolidated.\\nThe cut surface of the involved lobe is airless, red-pink,dry, granular and has liver-like consistency. The stage ofred hepatisation is accompanied by serofibrinous pleurisy.Histologically,  the following features are observed\\n(Fig. 17.8) :\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 17.1: Etiologic Classification of Pneumonias.\\nA.

Lipid pneumonia469CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory System\\ni) The oedema fluid of the preceding stage is replaced\\nby strands of fibrin.\\nii) There is marked cellular exudate of neutrophils and\\nextravasation of red cells.iii) Many neutrophils show ingested bacteria.iv) The alveolar septa are less prominent than in the firststage due to cellular exudation.\\n3. GREY HEPATISATION: LATE CONSOLIDATION\\n(Fig. 17.6,C) . This phase lasts for 4 to 8 days.Figure 17.6 The four stages of lobar pneumonia, showing correlation of gross appearance of the lung with microscopic appearance in each\\nstage. For details consult the text.\\n470SECTION III Systemic PathologyGrossly,  the affected lobe is firm and heavy. The cut\\nsurface is dry, granular and grey in appearance with liver-\\nlike consistency (Fig. 17.9, A) . The change in colour from\\nred to grey begins at the hilum and spreads towards theperiphery. Fibrinous pleurisy is prominent.Histologically,  the following changes are present\\n(Fig. 17.9,B) :\\ni)The fibrin strands are dense and more numerous.\\nii)The cellular exudate of neutrophils is reduced due to\\ndisintegration of many inflammatory cells as evidencedby their pyknotic nuclei. The red cells are also fewer. Themacrophages begin to appear in the exudate.iii)\\nThe cellular exudate is often separated from the septal\\nwalls by a thin clear space.iv) The organisms are less numerous and appear asdegenerated forms.\\n4. RESOLUTION  (Fig. 17.6,D) . This stage begins by 8th\\nto 9th day if no chemotherapy is administered and is\\ncompleted in 1 to 3 weeks. However, antibiotic therapyinduces resolution on about 3rd day. Resolution proceedsin a progressive manner.Grossly,  the previously solid fibrinous constituent is\\nliquefied by enzymatic action, eventually restoring thenormal aeration in the affected lobe. The process ofsoftening begins centrally and spreads to the periphery.The cut surface is grey-red or dirty brown and frothy,yellow, creamy fluid can be expressed on pressing. Thepleural reaction may also show resolution but mayundergo organisation leading to fibrous obliteration ofpleural cavity.Histologically,  the following features are noted:\\ni) Macrophages are the predominant cells in the alveolar\\nspaces, while neutrophils diminish in number. Many ofthe macrophages contain engulfed neutrophils and debris.ii)\\nGranular and fragmented strands of fibrin in the\\nalveolar spaces are seen due to progressive enzymaticdigestion.iii) Alveolar capillaries are engorged.iv) There is progressive removal of fluid content as wellas cellular exudate from the air spaces, partly byexpectoration but mainly by lymphatics, resulting inrestoration of normal lung parenchyma with aeration.\\nCOMPLICATIONS.  Since the advent of antibiotics, serious\\ncomplications of lobar pneumonia are uncommon. However,they may develop in neglected cases and in patients withimpaired immunologic defenses. These are as under:\\n1. Organisation.  In about 3% of cases, resolution of the\\nexudate does not occur but instead it undergoes organisation.\\nThere is ingrowth of fibroblasts from the alveolar septa resul-ting in fibrosed, tough, airless leathery lung tissue. This typeof post-pneumonic fibrosis is called carnification.\\n2.Pleural effusion.  About 5% of treated cases of lobar\\npneumonia develop inflammation of the pleura with effusion.The pleural effusion usually resolves but sometimes mayundergo organisation with fibrous adhesions betweenvisceral and parietal pleura.\\n3\\n. Empyema.  Less than 1% of treated cases of lobar\\npneumonia develop encysted pus in the pleural cavity\\ntermed empyema.\\n4. Lung abscess.  A rare complication of lobar pneumonia\\nis formation of lung abscess, especially when there is\\nsecondary infection by other organisms.\\n5. Metastatic infection.  Occasionally, infection in the lungs\\nand pleural cavity in lobar pneumonia may extend into the\\npericardium and the heart causing purulent pericarditis,bacterial endocarditis and myocarditis. Other forms ofmetastatic infection encountered rarely in lobar pneumoniasFigure 17.7 Lobar pneumonia, acute congestion stage. There is\\ncongestion of septal walls while the air spaces contain pale oedema\\nfluid and a few red cells.\\nFigure 17.8 Lobar pneumonia, red hepatisation stage. The alveoli\\nare filled with cellular exudates composed of neutrophils admixed with\\nsome red cells.\\n471CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory Systemare otitis media, mastoiditis, meningitis, brain abscess and\\npurulent arthritis.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Classically, the onset of lobar\\npneumonia is sudden. The major symptoms are: shaking\\nchills, fever, malaise with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea andcough with expectoration which may be mucoid, purulentor even bloody. The common physical findings are fever,tachycardia, and tachypnoea, and sometimes cyanosis if thepatient is severely hypoxaemic. There is generally a markedneutrophilic leucocytosis. Blood cultures are positive in about30% of cases. Chest radiograph may reveal consolidation.Culture of the organisms in the sputum and antibioticsensitivity are most significant investigations for institutionof specific antibiotics. The response to antibiotics is usuallyrapid with clinical improvement in 48 to 72 hours after theinitiation of antibiotics.\\nBronchopneumonia  (Lobular Pneumonia)\\nBronchopneumonia or lobular pneumonia is infection of the\\nterminal bronchioles that extends into the surroundingalveoli resulting in patchy consolidation of the lung. Thecondition is particularly frequent at the extremes of life (i.e.in infancy and old age), as a terminal event in chronicdebilitating diseases and as a secondary infection followingviral respiratory infections such as influenza, measles etc.\\nETIOLOGY.  The common organisms responsible for\\nbronchopneumonia are staphylococci, streptococci,\\npneumococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,\\nand gram-negative bacilli like Pseudomonas  and coliform\\nbacteria.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  bronchopneu-\\nmonia is identified by patchy areas of red or greyconsolidation affecting one or more lobes, frequentlyfound bilaterally and more often involving the lower zonesof the lungs due to gravitation of the secretions. On cutsurface, these patchy consolidated lesions are dry,granular, firm, red or grey in colour, 3 to 4 cm in diameter,slightly elevated over the surface and are often centredaround a bronchiole (Fig. 17.10) . These patchy areas are\\nbest picked up by passing the fingertips on the cut surface.Histologically,  the following features are observed\\n(Fig. 17.11) :\\ni)Acute bronchiolitis.\\nii) Suppurative exudate, consisting chiefly of neutrophils,in the peribronchiolar alveoli.iii)Thickening of the alveolar septa by congested\\ncapillaries and leucocytic infiltration.iv\\n) Less involved alveoli contain oedema fluid.\\nCOMPLICATIONS.  The complications of lobar pneumonia\\nmay occur in bronchopneumonia as well. However, completeresolution of bronchopneumonia is uncommon. There isgenerally some degree of destruction of the bronchiolesresulting in foci of bronchiolar fibrosis that may eventuallycause bronchiectasis.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The patients of bronchopneumonia\\nare generally infants or elderly individuals. There may be\\nhistory of preceding bed-ridden illness, chronic debility,aspiration of gastric contents or upper respiratory infection.For initial 2 to 3 days, there are features of acute bronchitisbut subsequently signs and symptoms similar to those oflobar pneumonia appear. Blood examination usually showsa neutrophilic leucocytosis. Chest radiograph shows mottled,focal opacities in both the lungs, chiefly in the lower zones.\\nThe salient features of the two main types of bacterial\\npneumonias are contrasted in Table 17.2.\\nFigure 17.9 Lobar pneumonia, grey hepatisation stage. A, The sectioned surface of the lung shows grey-brown, firm area of consolidation\\n(liver-like) affecting a lobe (arrow). B, The cellular exudates in the alveolar lumina is lying separated from the septal walls  by a clear space. The\\ninfiltrate in the lumina is composed of neutrophils and macrophages.\\n472SECTION III Systemic PathologyB. VIRAL AND MYCOPLASMAL PNEUMONIA\\n(PRIMARY ATYPICAL PNEUMONIA)\\nViral and mycoplasmal pneumonia is characterised by\\npatchy inflammatory changes, largely confined to interstitialtissue of the lungs, without any alveolar exudate. Other termsused for these respiratory tract infections are interstitialpneumonitis,  reflecting the interstitial location of the\\ninflammation, and primary atypical pneumonia,  atypicality\\nbeing the absence of alveolar exudate commonly present inother pneumonias. Interstitial pneumonitis may occur in allages. Most of the cases are mild and transient; exceptionallyit may be severe and fulminant.ETIOLOGY.  Interstitial pneumonitis is caused by a wide\\nvariety of agents, the most common being respiratory syncytial\\nvirus  (RSV). Others are Mycoplasma pneumoniae  and many\\nviruses such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses,\\nadenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coxsackieviruses and cyto-\\nmegaloviruses (CMV). Occasionally, psittacosis (Chlamydia)\\nand Q fever (Coxiella) are associated with interstitial\\npneumonitis.\\nInfections of the respiratory tract with these organisms\\nare quite common. In most cases, the infection remainsconfined to the upper respiratory tract presenting as commoncold. Occasionally, it may extend lower down to involve the\\ninterstitium of the lungs. The circumstances favouring such\\nFigure 17.10 A, Gross appearance of bronchopneumonia contrasted\\nwith that of lobar pneumonia. B, The pleural surface of the specimen of the\\nlung shows serofibrinous exudate. The sectioned surface shows multiple,small, grey-brown, firm, patchy areas of consolidation around bronchioles\\n(arrow). while the intervening lung is spongy.\\nFigure 17.11 Microscopic appearance of bronchopneumonia. The bronchioles as well as the adjacent alveoli are filled with exudate consisting\\nchiefly of neutrophils. The alveolar septa are thickened due to congested capillaries and neutrophilic infiltrate.\\n473CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory Systemextension of infection are malnutrition, chronic debilitating\\ndiseases and alcoholism.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Irrespective of the etio-\\nlogic agent, the pathologic changes are similar in all cases.Grossly,  depending upon the severity of infection, the\\ninvolvement may be patchy to massive and widespreadconsolidation of one or both the lungs. The lungs areheavy, congested and subcrepitant. Sectioned surface ofthe lung exudes small amount of frothy or bloody fluid.The pleural reaction is usually infrequent and mild.Histologically,  hallmark of viral pneumonias is the\\ninterstitial nature of the inflammatory reaction. Themicroscopic features are as under (Fig. 17.12) :\\ni) Interstitial inflammation:  There is thickening of\\nalveolar walls due to congestion, oedema and mono-nuclear inflammatory infiltrate comprised by lympho-cytes, macrophages and some plasma cells.\\nii) Necrotising bronchiolitis: This is characterised by foci\\nof necrosis of the bronchiolar epithelium, inspissated\\nsecretions in the lumina and mononuclear infiltrate in thewalls and lumina.\\niii)Reactive changes:  The lining epithelial cells of the\\nbronchioles and alveoli proliferate in the presence of virus\\nand may form multinucleate giant cells and syncytia inthe bronchiolar and alveolar walls. Occasionally, viralinclusions (intranuclear and/or intracytoplasmic) arefound, especially in pneumonitis caused by CMV.\\ni\\nv) Alveolar changes:  In severe cases, the alveolar lumina\\nmay contain oedema fluid, fibrin, scanty inflammatory\\nexudate and coating of alveolar walls by pink, hyalinemembrane similar to the one seen in respiratory distresssyndrome (page 462). Alveolar changes are prominent ifbacterial infection supervenes.COMPLICATIONS.  The major complication of interstitial\\npneumonitis is superimposed bacterial infection and itscomplications. Most cases of interstitial pneumonitis recovercompletely. In more severe cases, there may be interstitialfibrosis and permanent damage.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES. Majority of cases of interstitial\\npneumonitis initially have upper respiratory symptoms with\\nfever, headache and muscle-aches. A few days later appearsdry, hacking, non-productive cough with retrosternalburning due to tracheitis and bronchitis.

Chest radiograph\\nmay show patchy or diffuse consolidation. Cold agglutinintitres in the serum are elevated in almost half the cases ofmycoplasmal pneumonia, 20% cases of adenovirus infectionbut absent in other forms of viral pneumonia. Isolation ofthe etiologic agent, otherwise, is difficult.\\nC. OTHER TYPES OF PNEUMONIAS\\nSome other types of pneumonias caused by infective agents\\n(such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Legionella\\npneumonia) and certain non-infective varieties  (e.g. aspiration\\npneumonia, hypostatic pneumonia and lipid pneumonia) are\\ndescribed here.\\nPneumocystis carinii  Pneumonia\\nPneumocystis carinii,  a protozoon widespread in the\\nenvironment, causes pneumonia by inhalation of the\\norganisms as an opportunistic infection in neonates andimmunosuppressed people. Almost 100% cases of HIV/AIDS develop opportunistic infection during the course ofdisease, most commonly Pneumocystis carinii  pneumonia.\\nTable 17.3  lists the various etiologic types of pneumonias\\nassociated with HIV infection due to profound immuno-suppression. Other immunosuppressed groups are patientson chemotherapy for organ transplant and tumours,malnutrition, agammaglobulinaemia etc.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the affected parts\\nof the lung are consolidated, dry and grey.\\nMicroscopically,  the features are as under:\\ni)Interstitial pneumonitis with thickening and\\nmononuclear infiltration of the alveolar walls.\\ni\\ni) Alveolar lumina contain pink frothy fluid containing\\nthe organisms.iii) By Gomori’s methenamine-silver (GMS) stain, the\\ncharacteristic oval or crescentic cysts, about 5 μm in\\ndiameter and surrounded by numerous tiny black dot-like trophozoites of P. carinii  are demonstrable in the frothy\\nfluid.iv) No significant inflammatory exudate is seen in the airspaces.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  There is rapid onset of dyspnoea,\\ntachycardia, cyanosis and non-productive cough. Ifuntreated, it causes death in one or two weeks. Chestradiograph shows diffuse alveolar and interstitial infiltrate.Legionella Pneumonia\\nLegionella pneumonia or Legionnaire’s disease is an epidemicillness caused by gram-negative bacilli, Legionella pneumophila\\nthat thrives in aquatic environment. It was first recognisedfollowing investigation into high mortality among thoseattending American Legion Convention in Philadelphia inJuly 1976. The epidemic occurs in summer months by spreadof organisms through contaminated drinking water or in air-conditioning cooling towers. Impaired host defenses in theform of immunodeficiency, corticosteroid therapy, old ageand cigarette smoking play important roles.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  there are chan-\\nges of widespread bronchopneumonia involving manylobes and there may be consolidation of the entire lung.Pleural effusion is frequently present.Histologically,  the changes are not distinctive. Common\\nfeatures are as under:i)Intra-alveolar exudate, initially of neutrophils but later\\ncomposed mainly of macrophages.i\\ni) Alveolar septa show foci of hyperplasia of the lining\\nepithelium and thrombosis of vessels in the septa.iii) The organisms may be demonstrated in the macro-phages by special stains or by immunofluorescenttechniques.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The disease begins with malaise,\\nheadache and muscle-aches followed by high fever, chills,cough and tachypnoea. Systemic manifestations unrelatedto pathologic changes in the lungs are seen due tobacteraemia and include abdominal pain, watery diarrhoea,proteinuria and mild hepatic dysfunction.\\nAspiration (Inhalation) Pneumonia\\nAspiration or inhalation pneumonia results from inhalation\\nof different agents into the lungs. These substances includefood, gastric contents, foreign body and infected materialfrom oral cavity. A number of factors predispose to inhalationpneumonia which include: unconsciousness, drunkenness,neurological disorders affecting swallowing, drowning,necrotic oropharyngeal tumours, in premature infants andcongenital tracheo-oesophageal fistula. Some patients dieimmediately from asphyxiation or laryngospasm withoutdeveloping pneumonia.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Pathologic changes vary\\ndepending upon the particulate matter aspirated but ingeneral right lung is affected more often due to direct pathfrom the main bronchus:\\n1.Aspiration of small amount of sterile foreign matter\\nsuch as acidic gastric contents produce chemical\\npneumonitis.  It is characterised by haemorrhagic\\npulmonary oedema with presence of particles in the\\nbronchioles. Patients rapidly develop cyanosis, dyspnoea,shock and bloody sputum and are often likely to die ofcardiac failure. If the patient survives the acute episode,secondary bacterial infection is likely to occur.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 17.3: Etiologic Types of HIV-Infection Associated\\nPneumonias.\\n1.Pneumocystis carinii\\n2.

Invasive candidiasis475CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory System2.Non-sterile aspirate  causes widespread broncho-\\npneumonia  with multiple areas of necrosis and suppu-\\nration. A granulomatous reaction with foreign body giant\\ncells may surround the aspirated vegetable matter.\\nHypostatic Pneumonia\\nHypostatic pneumonia is the term used for collection of\\noedema fluid and secretions in the dependent parts of thelungs in severely debilitated, bed-ridden patients. Theaccumulated fluid in the basal zone and posterior part oflungs gets infected by bacteria from the upper respiratorytract and sets in bacterial pneumonia. Hypostatic pneumoniais a common terminal event in the old, feeble, comatosepatients.\\nLipid Pneumonia\\nAnother variety of non-infective pneumonia is lipid\\npneumonia which is of 2 types: exogenous and endogenous.\\n1. Exogenous lipid pneumonia.  This is caused by aspiration\\nof a variety of oily materials. These are: inhalation of oily\\nnasal drops, regurgitation of oily medicines from stomach(e.g. liquid paraffin), administration of oily vitaminpreparation to reluctant children or to debilitated oldpatients.\\n2.\\nEndogenous lipid pneumonia.  Endogenous origin of\\nlipids causing pneumonic consolidation is more common.\\nThe sources of origin are tissue breakdown followingobstruction to airways e.g. obstruction by bronchogeniccancer, tuberculosis and bronchiectasis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the exogenous\\nlipid pneumonia affects the right lung more frequentlydue to direct path from the main bronchus. Quite often,the lesions are bilateral. The affected part of the lungs isconsolidated. Cut surface is characteristically ‘goldenyellow’.Microscopically,  the features are as under:\\ni) Lipid is finely dispersed in the cytoplasm ofmacrophages forming foamy macrophages within thealveolar spaces.ii) There may be formation of cholesterol clefts due toliberation of cholesterol and other lipids.iii) Formation of granulomas with foreign body giant cellsmay be seen around the large lipid droplets.\\nLUNG ABSCESS\\nLung abscess is a localised area of necrosis of lung tissue\\nwith suppuration. It is of 2 types (Fig. 17.13) :\\nPrimary lung abscess  that develops in an otherwise normal\\nlung. The commonest cause is aspiration of infected material.\\nSecondary lung abscess  that develops as a complication of\\nsome other disease of the lung or from another site.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The microorganisms commonly\\nisolated from the lungs in lung abscess are streptococci,\\nstaphylococci and various gram-negative organisms. Theseare introduced into the lungs from one of the followingmechanisms:\\n1.Aspiration of infected foreign material.  A number of\\nforeign materials such as food, decaying teeth, gastric\\ncontents, severely infected gingivae and teeth, and necrotictissue from lesions in the mouth, upper respiratory tract ornasopharynx may be aspirated. This occurs particularly infavourable circumstances such as during sleep,\\nunconsciousness, anaesthesia, general debility and acute\\nalcoholism.\\n2.Preceding bacterial infection.  Preceding broncho-\\npneumonia in a debilitated patient may develop into lung\\nabscess. Other infective conditions like tuberculosis,bronchiectasis and mycotic infections may occasionally resultin formation of lung abscess.\\n3.\\nBronchial obstruction.  An abscess may form distal to an\\nobstructed bronchus such as from bronchial tumour or from\\nimpacted foreign body.\\n4. Septic embolism.  Infected emboli originating from\\npyaemia, thrombophlebitis or from vegetative bacterial\\nendocarditis may be disseminated in the venous circulationand reach the right side of the heart from where they arelodged in the lung and result in multiple abscesses.\\n5. Miscellaneous.  Rarely lung abscesses may occur from\\nfollowing causes:\\ni) Infection in pulmonary infarcts.ii) Amoebic abscesses due to infection with Entamoeba\\nhistolytica.iii) Trauma to the lungs.iv) Direct extension from a suppurative focus in themediastinum, oesophagus, subphrenic area or spine.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Abscesses due to aspira-\\ntion are more likely to be in right lung due to more verticalmain bronchus and are frequently single. They arecommonly located in the lower part of the right upperlobe or apex of right lower lobe. Abscesses developingFigure 17.13 Common locations of lung abscess. A, Primary lung\\nabscess —mostly single, large, commonly due to aspiration, located most\\nfrequently in the lower part of right upper lobe or apex of right lower lobe.\\nB, Secondary lung abscesses —mostly multiple, small, most commonly\\npost-pneumonic or following septic embolism.\\n476SECTION III Systemic Pathologyfrom preceding pneumonia and septic or pyaemic\\nabscesses are often multiple and scattered throughout thelung.\\nGrossly,  abscesses may be of variable size from a few\\nmillimeters to large cavities, 5 to 6 cm in diameter. The\\ncavity often contains exudate. An acute lung abscess isinitially surrounded by acute pneumonia and has poorly-defined ragged wall. With passage of time, the abscessbecomes chronic and develops fibrous wall (Fig. 17.14,A) .\\nHistologically,  the characteristic feature is the destruction\\nof lung parenchyma with suppurative exudate in the lungcavity. The cavity is initially surrounded by acuteinflammation in the wall but later there is replacement bychronic inflammatory cell infiltrate composed oflymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. In morechronic cases, there is considerable fibroblasticproliferation forming a fibrocollagenic wall (Fig. 17.14,B) .\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations are\\nfever, malaise, loss of weight, cough, purulent expectorationand haemoptysis in half the cases. Clubbing of the fingersand toes appears in about 20% of patients. Secondaryamyloidosis may occur in chronic long-standing cases.\\nFUNGAL INFECTIONS OF LUNG\\nFungal infections of the lung are more common than\\ntuberculosis in the US. These infections in healthy individualsare rarely serious but in immunosuppressed individuals mayprove fatal. General aspects of mycotic infections are coveredin Chapter 7. Here, s ome common examples of fungal\\ninfections of the lung are briefly given:\\n1. Aspergillosis.  Aspergillosis is the most common fungal\\ninfection of the lung caused by Aspergillus fumigatus that\\ngrows best in cool, wet climate. The infection may result inallergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma  and\\nnecrotising bronchitis.  Immunocompromised persons develop\\nmore serious manifestations of aspergillus infection,\\nespecially in leukaemic patients on cytotoxic drug therapyand HIV/AIDS. Extensive haematogenous spread ofaspergillus infection may result in widespread changes inlung tissue due to arterial occlusion, thrombosis andinfarction.\\nGrossly,  pulmonary aspergillosis may occur within\\npreexisting pulmonary cavities or in bronchiectasis as fungal\\nball.\\nMicroscopically,  the fungus may appear as a tangled mass\\nwithin the cavity. The organisms are identified by their\\ncharacteristic morphology— thin septate hyphae withdichotomous branching at acute angles which stain positivefor fungal stains such as PAS and silver impregnationtechnique (Fig. 17.15) . The wall of the cavity shows chronic\\ninflammatory cells.\\n2. Mucormycosis.  Mucormycosis or phycomycosis is\\ncaused by Mucor  and Rhizopus.  The infection in the lung\\noccurs in a similar way as in aspergillosis. The pulmonary\\nlesions are especially common in patients of diabetic\\nketoacidosis. Mucor is distinguished by its broad, non-parallel,\\nnonseptate hyphae which branch at an obtuse angle.Mucormycosis is more often angioinvasive, anddisseminates; hence it is more destructive than aspergillosis.\\n3.\\nCandidiasis.  Candidiasis or moniliasis caused by Candida\\nalbicans  is a normal commensal in oral cavity, gut and vagina\\nbut attains pathologic form in immunocompromised host.\\nAngioinvasive growth of the organism may occur in theairways.\\n4. Histoplasmosis. It is caused by oval organism, Histoplasma\\ncapsulatum,  by inhalation of infected dust or bird droppings.\\nThe condition may remain asymptomatic or may produce\\nlesions similar to the Ghon’s complex.\\nFigure 17.14 Lung abscess. A, The pleura is thickened. Cut surface of the lung shows multiple cavities 1-4 cm in diameter, having irregular and\\nragged inner walls (arrow).  The lumina contain necrotic debris. The surrounding lung parenchyma is consolidated. B, The photomicrograph shows\\nabscess formed by necrosed alveoli and dense acute and chronic inflammatory cells.\\n477CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory System5. Cryptococcosis.  It is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans\\nwhich is round yeast having a halo around it due to shrinkage\\nin tissue sections. The infection occurs from infection byinhalation of pigeon droppings. The lesions in the body mayrange from a small parenchymal granuloma in the lung tocryptococcal meningitis.\\n6. Coccidioidomycosis.  Coccidioidomycosis is caused by\\nCoccidioides immitis  which are spherical spores. The infection\\nin human beings is acquired by close contact with infected\\ndogs. The lesions consist of peripheral parenchymalgranuloma in the lung.\\n7. Blastomycosis.  It is an uncommon condition caused by\\nBlastomyces dermatitidis.  The lesions result from inhalation\\nof spores in the ground. Pathological features may present\\nas Ghon’s complex-like lesion, as a pneumonic consolidation,and as multiple skin nodules.\\nPULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS\\nThe classical and most common example of chronic infection\\nof the lungs is pulmonary tuberculosis. Pulmonary lesions\\ncaused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis  and other mycobacteria\\nhave already been discussed along with general aspects oftuberculosis and other granulomatous inflammations inChapter 6.\\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic\\nobstructive airway disease (COAD) are commonly usedclinical terms for a group of pathological conditions in whichthere is chronic, partial or complete, obstruction to the airflowat any level from trachea to the smallest airways resulting infunctional disability of the lungs i.e. they are diffuse lungdiseases. The following 4 entities are included in COPD:\\nI.\\nChronic bronchitisII. EmphysemaIII.\\nBronchial asthma\\nIV. Bronchiectasis\\nChronic bronchitis and emphysema are quite common\\nand often occur together. Now, small airways disease\\ninvolving inflammation of small bronchi and bronchioles(bronchiolitis) has also been added to the group of COPD.\\nCHRONIC BRONCHITIS\\nChronic bronchitis is a common condition defined clinically\\nas persistent cough with expectoration on most days for atleast three months of the year for two or more consecutiveyears. The cough is caused by oversecretion of mucus. Inspite of its name, chronic inflammation of the bronchi is nota prominent feature. The condition is more common inmiddle-aged males than females; approximately 20% of adultmen and 5% of adult women have chronic bronchitis, butonly a minority of them develop serious disabling COPD orcor pulmonale. Quite frequently, chronic bronchitis isassociated with emphysema.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The two most important etiologic\\nfactors responsible for majority of cases of chronic bronchitis\\nare: cigarette smoking and atmospheric pollution. Othercontributory factors are occupation, infection, familial andgenetic factors.\\n1. Smoking.  The most commonly identified factor\\nimplicated in causation of chronic bronchitis and in\\nemphysema is heavy smoking. Heavy cigarette smokers have4 to 10 times higher proneness to develop chronic bronchitis.Prolonged cigarette smoking appears to act on the lungs in anumber of ways:i)It impairs ciliary movement.\\ni\\ni) It inhibits the function of alveolar macrophages.\\niii) It leads to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucus-\\nsecreting glands.\\nFigure 17.15 Aspergillosis lung. A, Acute angled septate hyphae\\nlying in necrotic debris and acute inflammatory exudates in lung abscess.\\nB, Organisms, Apergillus flavus , are best identified with a special stain\\nfor fungi, Gomory’s methenamine silver (GMS).\\n478SECTION III Systemic Pathologyiv) It causes considerable obstruction of small airways.\\nv) It stimulates the vagus and causes bronchoconstriction.\\n2. Atmospheric pollution.  The incidence of chronic\\nbronchitis is higher in industrialised urban areas where air\\nis polluted. Some of the atmospheric pollutants whichincrease the risk of developing chronic bronchitis are sulfurdioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate dust and toxic fumes.\\n3. Occupation.  Workers engaged in certain occupations\\nsuch as in cotton mills (byssinosis), plastic factories etc. are\\nexposed to various organic or inorganic dusts whichcontribute to disabling chronic bronchitis in such individuals.\\n4. Infection.  Bacterial, viral and mycoplasmal infections do\\nnot initiate chronic bronchitis but usually occur secondary\\nto bronchitis. Cigarette smoke, however, predisposes toinfection responsible for acute exacerbation in chronicbronchitis.\\n5. Familial and genetic factors.  There appears to be a\\npoorly-defined familial tendency and genetic predisposition\\nto develop disabling chronic bronchitis. However, it is morelikely that nonsmoker family members who remain in theair-pollution of home are significantly exposed to smoke(passive smoking) and hence have increased blood levels ofcarbon monoxide.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the bronchial\\nwall is thickened, hyperaemic and oedematous. Luminaof the bronchi and bronchioles may contain mucus plugsand purulent exudate.Microscopically,  just as there is clinical definition, there\\nis histologic definition of chronic bronchitis by increasedReid index. Reid index  is the ratio between thickness of\\nthe submucosal mucus glands (i.e. hypertrophy andhyperplasia) in the cartilage-containing large airways tothat of the total bronchial wall (Fig. 17.16) . The increase\\nin thickness can be quantitatively assessed by micrometerlens. The bronchial epithelium may show squamousmetaplasia and dysplasia. There is little chronicinflammatory cell infiltrate. The non-cartilage containingsmall airways show goblet cell hyperplasia and intra-luminal and peribronchial fibrosis.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  There is considerable overlap of\\nclinical features of chronic bronchitis and pulmonaryemphysema (discussed below) as quite often the two coexist.The contrasting features of ‘predominant emphysema’ and‘predominant bronchitis’ are presented in Table 17.5.  Some\\nimportant features of ‘predominant bronchitis’ are as under:1. Persistent cough with copious expectoration of long\\nduration; initially beginning in a heavy smoker with ‘morningcatarrh’ or ‘throat clearing’ which worsens in winter.2.Recurrent respiratory infections are common.\\n3.\\nDyspnoea is generally not prominent at rest but is more\\non exertion.4. Patients are called ‘blue bloaters’ due to cyanosis andoedema.5. Features of right heart failure (cor pulmonale) arecommon.6. Chest X-ray shows enlarged heart with prominentvessels.EMPHYSEMA\\nThe WHO has defined pulmonary emphysema as\\ncombination of permanent dilatation of air spaces distal tothe terminal bronchioles and the destruction of the walls ofdilated air spaces. Thus, emphysema is defined morphologically,\\nwhile chronic bronchitis is defined clinically. Since the two\\nconditions coexist frequently and show considerable overlapin their clinical features, it is usual to label patients as‘predominant emphysema’ and ‘predominant bronchitis’.\\nCLASSIFICATION.  As mentioned in the beginning of this\\nchapter, a lobule is composed of about 5 acini distal to a\\nterminal bronchiole and that an acinus consists of 3 to 5generations of respiratory bronchioles and a variable numberof alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs (page 461). As per WHOdefinition of pulmonary emphysema, it is classified accordingto the portion of the acinus involved, into 5 types: centri-acinar, panacinar (panlobular), para-septal (distal acinar),irregular (para-cicatricial) and mixed (unclassified)emphysema. A number of other conditions to which the term‘emphysema’ is loosely applied are, in fact, examples of‘overinflation’. A classification based on these principles isoutlined in Table 17.4.Figure 17.16 Diagrammatic representation of increased Reid’s index\\nin chronic bronchitis.\\n\\uf075\\uf075TABLE 17.4: Classification of ‘True Emphysema’ and\\n‘Overinflation’.\\nA.

Obstructive overinflation (infantile lobar emphysema)4. Unilateral translucent lung (unilateral emphysema)5. Interstitial emphysema (surgical emphysema)\\n479CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory SystemETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The commonest form of COPD is\\nthe combination of chronic bronchitis and pulmonary\\nemphysema. Chronic bronchitis, however, does not always\\nlead to emphysema nor all cases of emphysema have changes\\nof chronic bronchitis. The association of the two conditionsis principally linked to the common etiologic factors— mostimportantly tobacco smoke  and air pollutants.  Other less\\nsignificant contributory factors are occupational exposure,infection and somewhat poorly-understood familial andgenetic influences. All these factors have already beendiscussed above.\\nHowever, pathogenesis of the most significant event in\\nemphysema, the destruction of the alveolar walls,  is not linked\\nto bronchial changes but is closely related to deficiency ofserum alpha-1-antitrypsin ( α1-protease inhibitor) commonly\\ntermed protease-antiprotease hypothesis  detailed below.\\nProtease-antiprotease hypothesis.  Alpha-1-antitrypsin ( α-\\n1-AT), also called α1-protease inhibitor ( α-1-Pi), is a\\nglycoprotein that forms the normal constituent of the α1-\\nglobulin fraction of the plasma proteins on serumelectrophoresis. The single gene locus that codes for α-1-AT\\nis located on the long arm of chromosome 15. It is normallysynthesised in the liver and is distributed in the circulating\\nblood, tissue fluids and macrophages. The normal function\\nof α1-AT is to inhibit proteases and hence its name α1-\\nprotease inhibitor. The proteases (mainly elastases) arederived from neutrophils. Neutrophil elastase has the\\ncapability of digesting lung parenchyma but is inhibited from\\ndoing so by anti-elastase effect of α1-AT.\\n There are several known alleles of α1-AT which have an\\nautosomal codominant inheritance pattern and are classified\\nas normal  ( PiMM ), deficient ( PiZZ ), null type ( Pi null null )\\nhaving no detectable leve l, and dysfunctional ( PiSS ) type\\nhaving about half the normal level.The most common abnormal phenotype in classic α1-AT\\ndeficiency is homozygous state PiZZ  resulting from a single\\namino acid substitution Glu→ Lys which causes spontaneous\\npolymerisation of α1-AT and inhibits its release  from the\\nliver. The remaining material of α1-AT in the liver causes\\nhepatic cirrhosis (Chapter 22).\\nClinically significant deficiency is also associated with\\nhomozygous Pi null null  and heterozygous Pi nullZ.\\nThe heterozygote pattern of PiMZ has intermediate levels\\nwhich is not sufficient to produce clinical deficiency, but\\nheterozygote individuals who smoke heavily have higherrisk of developing emphysema.\\nThe α1-AT deficiency develops in adults and causes\\npulmonary emphysema in smokers as well as in non-smokers, though the smokers become symptomatic about15 years earlier than non-smokers. The other organ showingeffects of α1-AT deficiency is the liver which may develop\\nobstructive jaundice early in infancy, and cirrhosis andhepatoma late in adulthood (Chapter 22).\\nThe mechanism of alveolar wall destruction in\\nemphysema by elastolytic action is based on the imbalancebetween proteases (chiefly elastase)  and anti-proteases (chiefly\\nanti-elastase):\\nBy decreased anti-elastase activity i.e. deficiency of α-1\\nantitrypsin.\\nBy increased activity of elastase i.e. increased neutrophilic\\ninfiltration in the lungs causing excessive elaboration ofneutrophil elastase.\\nThere are enough evidences to suggest that smoking\\npromotes emphysema by both decreasing the amount of anti-elastase as well as by increasing the elastolytic protease inthe lungs. These are as under:\\n1. Oxidant in cigarette smoke has inhibitory influence on\\nα-1-antitrypsin, thus lowering the level of anti-elastase\\nactivity.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 17.5: Contrasting Salient Features of ‘Predominant Bronchitis’ and ‘Predominant Emphysema’.\\nFeature Predominant Bronchitis Predominant Emphysema\\n1.

Emphysema can be\\ndiagnosed with certainty only by gross and histologicexamination of sections of whole lung. The lungs shouldbe perfused with formalin under pressure in inflated stateto grade the severity of emphysema with naked eye.Grossly,  the lungs are voluminous, pale with little blood.\\nThe edges of the lungs are rounded. Mild cases show\\ndilatation of air spaces visible with hand lens. Advanced\\ncases show subpleural bullae and blebs bulging outwards\\nfrom the surface of the lungs with rib markings betweenthem. The bullae  are air-filled cyst-like or bubble-like\\nstructures, larger than 1 cm in diameter (Fig. 17.18) . They\\nare formed by the rupture of adjacent air spaces whileblebs  are the result of rupture of alveoli directly into the\\nsubpleural interstitial tissue and are the common causeof spontaneous pneumothorax.\\nMicroscopically,  depending upon the type of emphysema,\\nthere is dilatation of air spaces and destruction of septal\\nwalls of part of acinus involved i.e. respiratory bron-\\nchioles, alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs. Changes ofbronchitis may be present. Bullae and blebs when presentshow fibrosis and chronic inflammation of the walls.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Cases of ‘predominant emphysema’\\ndevelop clinical features after about one-third of thepulmonary parenchyma is damaged which occurs mostseverely in panacinar emphysema. The age at the time of\\ndiagnosis is often a decade later (about 60 years) than the\\nage for predominan t bronchitis (about 50 years). Though\\nthere is considerable overlap between the clinical features of\\nchronic bronchitis and emphysema, the following featuresgenerally characterise ‘predominant emphysema’(Table 17.5):1.There is long history of slowly increasing severe\\nexertional dyspnoea.2.\\nPatient is quite distressed with obvious use of accessory\\nmuscles of respiration.Figure 17.17 Pathogenesis of alveolar wall destruction in\\nemphysema by protease-antiprotease mechanism.\\nFigure 17.18 Bullous emphysema.

Chest is barrel-shaped and hyperresonant.\\n4. Cough occurs late after dyspnoea starts and is associated\\nwith scanty mucoid sputum.\\n5. Recurrent respiratory infections are not frequent.6. Patients are called ‘pink puffers’ as they remain welloxygenated and have tachypnoea.\\n7. Weight loss is common.\\n8. Features of right heart failure (cor pulmonale) andhypercapneic respiratory failure are the usual terminalevents.\\n9. Chest X-ray shows small heart with hyperinflated lungs.\\nAfter these general comments about morphologic and\\nclinical features of emphysema, the specific pathologic\\nchanges in individual types of ‘emphysema’ and\\n‘overinflation’ as classified in Table 17.4 are described below.\\nMorphology of Individual Types of Emphysema\\n1. CENTRIACINAR (CENTRILOBULAR) EMPHYSEMA.\\nCentriacinar or centrilobular emphysema is one of the\\ncommon types. It is characterised by initial involvement of\\nrespiratory bronchioles i.e. the central or proximal part ofthe acinus  (Fig. 17.19,B) . This is the type of emphysema that\\nusually coexists with chronic bronchitis and occurs\\npredominantly in smokers and in coal miners’ pneumo-\\nconiosis (page 488).\\nGrossly,  the lesions are more common and more severe\\nin the upper lobes of the lungs. The characteristicappearance is obvious in cut  surface of the lung. It shows\\ndistended air spaces in the centre of the lobulessurrounded by a rim of normal lung parenchyma in the\\nsame lobule. The lobules are separated from each other\\nby fine fibrous tissue septa. Large amount of blackpigment is often present in the walls of emphysematousspaces. In more severe cases, distal parts of acini are also\\ninvolved and the appearance may closely resemble\\npanacinar emphysema.\\nMicroscopically,  there is distension and destruction of the\\nrespiratory bronchiole in the centre of lobules, surroun-\\nded peripherally by normal uninvolved alveoli. Theterminal bronchioles supplying the acini show chronic\\ninflammation and are narrowed.\\n2.\\nPANACINAR (PANLOBULAR) EMPHYSEMA.\\nPanacinar or panlobular emphysema is the other common\\ntype. In this type, all portions of the acinus are affected butnot of the entire lung (Fig. 17.19,C) . Panacinar emphysema\\nis most often associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency in\\nmiddle-aged smokers and is the one that produces the mostcharacteristic anatomical changes in the lung in emphysema.\\nGrossly,  in contrast to centriacinar emphysema, the\\npanacinar emphysema involves lower zone of lungs morefrequently and more severely than the upper zone. Theinvolvement may be confined to a few lobules, or may be\\nmore widespread affecting a lobe or part of a lobe of the\\nlung. The lungs are enlarged and overinflated.\\nFigure 17.19 The anatomic regions of involvement in an acinus in major forms of emphysema.\\n482SECTION III Systemic PathologyMicroscopically,  usually all the alveoli within a lobule\\nare affected to the same degree. All portions of acini are\\ndistended—respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and\\nalveoli, are all dilated and their walls stretched and thin.\\nRuptured alveolar walls and spurs of broken septa areseen between the adjacent alveoli. The capillaries arestretched and thinned. Special stains show loss of elastic\\ntissue. Inflammatory changes are usually absent\\n(Fig. 17.20) .\\n3. PARASEPTAL (DISTAL ACINAR) EMPHYSEMA.  This\\ntype of emphysema involves distal part of acinus while theproximal part is normal. Paraseptal or distal acinar\\nemphysema is localised along the pleura and along the\\nperilobular septa. The involvement is seen adjacent to theareas of fibrosis and atelectasis and involves upper part oflungs more severely than the lower. This form of emphysema\\nis seldom associated with COPD but is the common cause of\\nspontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. Grossly, thesubpleural portion of the lung shows air-filled cysts, 0.5 to2 cm in diameter.\\n4. IRREGULAR (PARA-CICATRICIAL) EMPHYSEMA.\\nThis is the most common form of emphysema, seen\\nsurrounding scars from any cause. The involvement is\\nirregular as regards the portion of acinus involved as well aswithin the lung as a whole. During life, irregular emphysemais often asymptomatic and may be only an incidental autopsy\\nfinding.\\n5. MIXED (UNCLASSIFIED) EMPHYSEMA.  Quite often,\\nthe same lung may show more than one type of emphysema.\\nIt is usually due to more severe involvement resulting in loss\\nof clearcut distinction between one type of emphysema andthe other. Thus, the lungs of an elderly smoker at autopsymay show continuation of centriacinar emphysema in the\\nupper lobes, panacinar in the lower lobes, and paraseptal\\nemphysema in the subpleura l region.Morphology of Types of Overinflation\\nUnder this heading are covered a group of lung conditions\\nof heterogeneous etiology characterised by overinflation ofthe parts of acini but without significant destruction of thewalls and are sometimes loosely termed emphysema.\\n1.COMPENSATORY OVERINFLATION (COMPEN-\\nSATORY  EMPHYSEMA).  When part of a lung or a lobe of\\nlung is surgically removed, the residual lung parenchyma\\nundergoes compensatory hyperinflation so as to fill thepleural cavity. Histologic examination shows dilatation ofalveoli but no destruction of septal walls and hence the termcompensatory overinflation is preferable over ‘compensatoryemphysema’.\\n2.\\nSENILE HYPERINFLATION (AGING LUNG, SENILE\\nEMPHYSEMA).  In old people, the lungs become voluminous\\ndue to loss of elastic tissue, thinning and atrophy of the\\nalveolar ducts and alveoli. The alveoli are thin-walled anddistended throughout the lungs but there is no significantdestruction of the septal walls and, therefore, preferabledesignation is ‘senile hyperinflation’ over ‘senileemphysema.’\\n3. OBSTRUCTIVE OVERINFLATION (INFANTILE\\nLOBAR EMPHYSEMA).  Partial obstruction to the bronchial\\ntree such as by a tumour or a foreign body causesoverinflation of the region supplied by obstructed bronchus.Infantile lobar emphysema is a variant of obstructiveoverinflation occurring in infants in the first few days of lifewho develop respiratory distress or who have congenitalhypoplasia of bronchial cartilage. In all such cases, air entersthe lungs during inspiration but cannot leave on expirationresulting in ballooning up of the affected part of the lung.\\n4. UNILATERAL TRANSLUCENT LUNG (UNILATE-\\nRAL EMPHYSEMA). This is a form of overinflation in which\\none lung or one of its lobes or segments of a lobe areradiolucent. The condition occurs in adults and there isgenerally a history of serious pulmonary infection inchildhood, probably bronchiolitis obliterans. The affectedFigure 17.20 Panacinar (Panlobular) emphysema showing involvement of the entire lobules and whole of acinus.\\n483CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory Systemlung is grossly overinflated. Microscopy shows overinflated\\nalveoli and there is histologic evidence of preceding\\nwidespread bronchiolitis obliterans.\\n5. INTERSTITIAL EMPHYSEMA (SURGICAL EMPHY-\\nSEMA).  The entry of air into the connective tissue framework\\nof the lung is called interstitial or surgical emphysema. The\\nusual sources of entry of air into stroma of the lung are\\nrupture of alveoli or of larger airways. The causes are asunder:i)Violent coughing with bronchiolar obstruction e.g. in\\nchildren with whooping cough, bronchitis, in patients withobstruction to the airways by foreign bodies, blood clots andexposure to irritant gases.i\\ni) Rupture of the oesophagus, trauma to the lung, or major\\nbronchus and trachea.iii) Entry of air through surgical incision.iv) Fractured rib puncturing the lung parenchyma.v) Sudden change in atmospheric pressure e.g. in\\ndecompression sickness.\\nThe condition may affect patients of all ages. On rupture\\nof alveoli, the leaked air enters the fibrous connective tissue\\nof the alveolar walls from where it extends into the fibroussepta of the lung, into the mediastinum, the pleura, and eventhe subcutaneous tissues. Escape of air into the pleural cavity\\nmay cause pneumothorax. Collection of small quantities of\\nair is generally harmless and is resorbed. However, extensiveaccumulation of air in surgical emphysema may produceimpaired blood flow in the lungs. Pneumo-mediastinum  may\\nproduce symptoms resembling myocardial infarction.\\nHistologically,  the alveoli are distended but septal walls\\nare not damaged; therefore it is not true emphysema.There are clear spaces of leaked out air in connective tissuesepta.\\nBRONCHIAL ASTHMA\\nAsthma is a disease of airways that is characterised by\\nincreased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to a\\nvariety of stimuli resulting in widespread spasmodicnarrowing of the air passages which may be relievedspontaneously or by therapy. Asthma is an episodic disease\\nmanifested clinically by paroxysms of dyspnoea, cough andwheezing. However, a severe and unremitting form of the\\ndisease termed status asthmaticus  may prove fatal.\\nBronchial asthma is common and prevalent worldwide;\\nin the United States about 4% of population is reported tosuffer from this disease. It occurs at all ages but nearly 50%of cases develop it before the age of 10 years. In adults, both\\nsexes are affected equally but in children there is 2:1 male-\\nfemale ratio.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS AND TYPES.  Based on the stimuli\\ninitiating bronchial asthma, two broad etiologic types are\\ntraditionally described: extrinsic (allergic, atopic)  and intrinsic\\n(idiosyncratic, non-atopic) asthma.  A third type is a mixed pattern\\nin which the features do not fit clearly into either of the two\\nmain types. The contrasting features of the two main types\\nare summed up in Table 17.6 .\\n1. Extrinsic (atopic, allergic) asthma.  This is the most\\ncommon type of asthma. It usually begins in childhood or in\\nearly adult life. Most patients of this type of asthma havepersonal and/or family history of preceding allergic diseasessuch as rhinitis, urticaria or infantile eczema. Hyper-\\nsensitivity to various extrinsic antigenic substances or\\n‘allergens’ is usually present in these cases. Most of theseallergens cause ill-effects by inhalation e.g. house dust,pollens, animal danders, moulds etc. Occupational asthma\\nstimulated by fumes, gases and organic and chemical dusts\\nis a variant of extrinsic asthma. There are increased levels ofIgE in the serum and positive skin test with the specificoffending inhaled antigen representing an IgE-mediated type\\nI hypersensitivity reaction which includes an ‘acute\\nimmediate response’ and a ‘late phase reaction’:\\nAcute immediate response  is initiated by IgE-sensitised mast\\ncells (tissue counterparts of circulating basophils) on the\\nmucosal surface. Mast cells on degranulation release\\nmediators like histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins,platelet activating factor and chemotactic factors foreosinophils and neutrophils. The net effects of these\\nmediators are bronchoconstriction, oedema, mucus\\nhypersecretion and accumulation of eosinophils andneutrophils.\\nLate phase reaction  follows the acute immediate response\\nand is responsible for the prolonged manifestations ofasthma. It is caused by excessive mobilisation of bloodleucocytes that include basophils besides eosinophils and\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 17.6: Contrasting Features of the Two Major Types of Asthma.\\nFeature Extrinsic Asthma Intrinsic Asthma\\n1.

These result in further release of mediators\\nwhich accentuate the above-mentioned effects. In addition,\\ninflammatory injury is caused by neutrophils and by major\\nbasic protein (MBP) of eosinophils.\\n2. Intrinsic (idiosyncratic, non-atopic) asthma.  This type\\nof asthma develops later in adult life with negative personal\\nor family history of allergy, negative skin test and normalserum levels of IgE. Most of these patients develop typicalsymptom-complex after an upper respiratory tract infectionby viruses. Associated nasal polypi and chronic bronchitisare commonly present. There are no recognisable allergensbut about 10% of patients become hypersensitive to drugs,most notably to small doses of aspirin (aspirin-sensitiveasthma).\\n3. Mixed type.  Many patients do not clearly fit into either\\nof the above two categories and have mixed features of both.\\nThose patients who develop asthma in early life have strongallergic component, while those who develop the disease latetend to be non-allergic. Either type of asthma can beprecipitated by cold, exercise and emotional stress.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The pathologic changes\\nare similar in both major types of asthma. The pathologicmaterial examined is generally autopsy of lungs inpatients dying of status asthmaticus but the changes areexpected to be similar in non-fatal cases.Grossly,  the lungs are overdistended due to over-inflation.\\nThe cut surface shows characteristic occlusion of thebronchi and bronchioles by viscid mucus plugs.Microscopically,  the following changes are observed\\n(Fig. 17.21) :\\n1. The mucus plugs contain normal or degenerated\\nrespiratory epithelium forming twisted strips calledCurschmann’s spirals .\\n2.The sputum usually contains numerous eosinophils\\nand diamond-shaped crystals derived from eosinophilscalled Charcot-Leyden crystals .\\n3\\n. The bronchial wall shows thickened basement\\nmembrane of the bronchial epithelium, submucosaloedema and inflammatory infiltrate consisting oflymphocytes and plasma cells with prominence of eosino-phils. There is hypertrophy of submucosal glands as wellas of the bronchial smooth muscle.4. Changes of bronchitis and emphysema may super-vene, especially in intrinsic asthma.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES. Asthmatic patients suffer from\\nepisodes of acute exacerbations interspersed with symptom-free periods. Characteristic clinical features are paroxysmsof dyspnoea, cough and wheezing. Most attacks typicallylast for a few minutes to hours. When attacks occurcontinuously it may result in more serious condition calledstatus asthmaticus.  The clinical diagnosis is supported by\\ndemonstration of circulation eosinophilia and sputumdemonstration of Curschmann’s spirals and Charcot-Leydencrystals. More chronic cases may develop cor pulmonale.\\nBRONCHIECTASIS\\nBronchiectasis is defined as abnormal and irreversible\\ndilatation of the bronchi and bronchioles (greater than 2 mmin diameter) developing secondary to inflammatoryweakening of the bronchial walls. The most characteristicclinical manifestation of bronchiectasis is persistent coughwith expectoration of copious amounts of foul-smelling,purulent sputum. Post-infectious cases commonly developin childhood and in early adult life.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The origin of inflammatory destruc-\\ntive process of bronchial walls is nearly always a result of\\ntwo basic mechanisms: endobronchial obstruction andinfection.\\nEndobronchial obstruction  by foreign body, neoplastic\\ngrowth or enlarged lymph nodes causes resorption of airdistal to the obstruction with consequent atelectasis andretention of secretions.\\nInfection  may be secondary to local obstruction and\\nimpaired systemic defense mechanism promoting bacterialgrowth, or infection may be a primary event i.e.bronchiectasis developing in suppurative necrotisingpneumonia.\\nThese 2 mechanisms—endobronchial obstruction and\\ninfection, are seen in a number of clinical settings as under:\\n1.Hereditary and congenital factors.  Several hereditary\\nand congenital factors may result secondarily in diffuse\\nbronchiectasis:i)Congenital bronchiectasis  caused by developmental defect\\nof the bronchial system.ii)Cystic fibrosis,  a generalised defect of exocrine gland\\nsecretions, results in obstruction, infection and bronchiectasis(Chapter 22).iii)Hereditary immune  deficiency diseases  are often associated\\nwith high incidence of bronchiectasis.iv)Immotile cilia syndrome  that includes Kartagener’s\\nsyndrome (bronchiectasis, situs inversus and sinusitis) ischaracterised by ultrastructural changes in the microtubulescausing immotility of cilia of the respiratory tract epithelium,sperms and other cells. Males in this syndrome are ofteninfertile (Chapter 23).\\nFigure 17.21 Diagrammatic appearance of Curschmann’s spiral and\\nCharcot-Leyden crystals found in mucus plugs in patients with bronchial\\nasthma.\\n485CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory Systemv)Atopic bronchial asthma  patients have often positive family\\nhistory of allergic diseases and may rarely develop diffuse\\nbronchiectasis.\\n2. Obstruction.  Post-obstructive bronchiectasis, unlike the\\ncongenital-hereditary forms, is of the localised variety,\\nusually confined to one part of the bronchial system. Thecauses of endobronchial obstruction include foreign bodies,endobronchial tumours, compression by enlarged hilar\\nlymph nodes and post-inflammatory scarring (e.g. in healed\\ntuberculosis) all of which favour the development of post-obstructive bronchiectasis.\\n3. As secondary complication.  Necrotising pneumonias  such\\nas in staphylococcal suppurative pneumonia and tuberculosis\\nmay develop bronchiectasis as a complication.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The disease charac-\\nteristically affects distal bronchi and bronchioles beyond\\nthe segmental bronchi.Grossly,  the lungs may be involved diffusely or\\nsegmentally. Bilateral involvement of lower lobes occursmost frequently. More vertical air passages of left lowerlobe are more often involved than the right. The pleura isusually fibrotic and thickened with adhesions to the chest\\nwall.  The dilated airways, depending upon their gross or\\nbronchographic appearance, have been subclassified intothe following different types (Fig. 17.22) :\\ni)Cylindrical:  the most common type characterised by\\ntube-like bronchial dilatation.\\nii)Fusiform:  having spindle-shaped bronchial dilatation.\\niii)Saccular:  having rounded sac-like bronchial distension.\\niv)Varicose:  having irregular bronchial enlargements.\\nCut surface of the affected lobes, generally the lower\\nzones, shows characteristic honey-combed appearance. The\\nbronchi are extensively dilated nearly to the pleura, theirwalls are thickened and the lumina are filled with mucus ormuco-pus. The intervening lung parenchyma is reduced and\\nfibrotic  (Fig. 17.23) .\\nMicroscopically,  fully-developed cases show the\\nfollowing histologic features (Fig. 17.24) :\\ni)The bronchial epithelium may be normal, ulcerated\\nor may show squamous metaplasia.\\nii)The bronchial wall shows infiltration by acute and\\nchronic inflammatory cells and destruction of normal\\nmuscle and elastic tissue with re\\nplacement by fibrosis.\\niii)The intervening lung parenchyma shows fibrosis,\\nwhile the surrounding lung tissue shows changes of\\ninterstitial pneumonia.\\niv) The pleura in the affected area is adherent and shows\\nbands of fibrous tissue between the bronchus and thepleura.Figure 17.22 Types of bronchial dilatations in bronchiectasis.\\nFigure 17.23 Bronchiectasis of the lung. Sectioned surface shows honey-combed appearance of the lung in the lower lobe where many thick-\\nwalled dilated cavities with cartilaginous wall are seen (arrow).\\n486SECTION III Systemic PathologyCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations of\\nbronchiectasis typically consist of chronic cough with foul-\\nsmelling sputum production, haemoptysis and recurrent\\npneumonia. Sinusitis is a common accompaniment of diffusebronchiectasis. Late complications occurring in casesuncontrolled for years include development of clubbing of\\nthe fingers, metastatic abscesses (often to the brain),\\namyloidosis and cor pulmonale.\\nCHRONIC RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE\\nThe second large group of diffuse lung disease is ‘chronic\\nrestrictive pulmonary disease’ characterised by reducedexpansion of lung parenchyma with decreased total lungcapacity. This group of diseases must be distinguished from\\nthe foregoing COPD (Table 17.7).\\nRestrictive lung disease includes 2 types of conditions:\\nA. Restriction due to chest wall disorder: It includes\\nfollowing conditions:1.Kyphoscoliosis\\n2. Poliomyelitis3.Severe obesity\\n4.\\nPleural diseases.\\nAs a group, these conditions cause restriction to\\nexpansion of lungs due to alterations in chest wall, pleuraand neuromuscular apparatus, but are primarily not lung\\nparenchymal diseases.\\nB. Restriction due to interstitial and infiltrative diseases.\\nCommonly called as ‘ interstitial lung diseases (ILDs)’,  these\\nare diseases characterised by non-infectious diffuse\\nparenchymal involvement of the lung i.e. the alveolar lumina\\nand alveolar epithelium, capillary basement membrane, theintervening space, perivascular tissue and lymphatic tissue.Diffuse lung parenchymal involvement may be primary, or\\nit may be involved secondarily as a part of some other multi-\\norgan disease process. The term ‘infiltrative’ is used here todenote the radiologic appearance of lungs in chestradiographs which show characteristic diffuse interstitial\\nground-glass opacities. The ILDs consist of more than 200\\nheterogeneous conditions which have common clinical,radiologic, and functional manifestations but diversepathological features. As a group, ILDs have high mortality\\nFigure 17.24 Microscopic appearance of a dilated distal bronchiole in bronchiectasis.

Depending upon the underlying pathologic\\nfindings, ILDs have been broadly classified into 2 groups,\\neach further subdivided into those with known and unknowncauses:\\nConditions with predominant non-specific inflammation\\n(alveolitis, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis).\\nConditions with predominant granulomatous inflam-\\nmation.\\nBased on this, an abbreviated classification of ILDs is\\ngiven in Table 17.8.\\nThe exact pathogenesis  of ILDs from injury to fibrosis is\\nnot known. However, it can be explained on immune basisas under (Fig. 17.25) :\\ni) There is local inflammatory reaction in the alveoli in response\\nto various exogenous and endogenous stimuli in the form of\\nlymphocytes (both B and T) and macrophages.\\nii) Activated macrophages cause recruitment of neutrophils\\nand also produce fibrogenic and chemotactic cytokines .\\nNeutrophils liberate proteases and oxidants which injure thetype I pneumocytes resulting in initial microscopic alveolitis,while cytokines cause subsequent proliferation of type IIpneumocytes and fibrosis.\\niii) The result is inflammatory destruction of the pulmonary\\nparenchyma followed by fibrosis. Eventually, there is\\nwidespread destruction of alveolar capillary walls resulting\\nin end-stage lung or ‘ honeycomb lung’.The major common clinical manifestations  of restrictive\\nlung diseases are exertional dyspnoea, non-persistent\\nproductive cough, tachypnoea, cyanosis and sometimeshaemoptysis but no wheezing so characteristic of COPD.\\nImportant and common examples of ILDs are discussed\\nbelow.\\nPNEUMOCONIOSES\\nPneumoconiosis is the term used for lung diseases caused\\nby inhalation of dust, mostly at work ( pneumo = lung; conis =\\ndust in Greek). These diseases are, therefore, also called ‘dustdiseases’ or ‘occupation al lung diseases’.\\nThe type of lung disease varies according to the nature\\nof inhaled dust. Some dusts are inert and cause no reactionand no damage at all, while others cause immunologicdamage and predispose to tuberculosis or to neoplasia. Thefactors which determine the extent of damage caused byinhaled dusts are as under:1. size and shape of the particles;2.their solubility and physicochemical composition;\\n3.\\nthe amount of dust retained in the lungs;\\n4. the additional effect of other irritants such as tobaccosmoke; and5. host factors such as efficiency of clearance mechanismand immune status of the host.\\nIn general, most of the inhaled dust particles larger than\\n5 μm reach the terminal airways where they are ingested by\\uf075\\uf075TABLE 17.8.

Most of these too are eliminated by\\nexpectoration but the remaining accumulate in alveolartissue. Of particular interest are the particles smaller than1 μm which are deposited in the alveoli most efficiently. Most\\nof the dust-laden macrophages accumulated in the alveolidie leaving the dust, around which fibrous tissue is formed.Some macrophages enter the lymphatics and reach regionallymph nodes. The tissue response to inhaled dust may beone of the following three types:\\nFibrous nodules  e.g. in coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis and\\nsilicosis.\\nInterstitial fibrosis  e.g. in asbestosis.\\nHypersensitivity reaction  e.g. in berylliosis.\\nA comprehensive list of various types of occupational\\nlung diseases caused by inorganic (mineral) dusts and orga-nic dusts is presented in Table 17.9.  The more common\\nexamples of pneumoconioses are described here.\\nCoal-Workers’ Pneumoconiosis\\nThis is the commonest form of pneumoconiosis and is defined\\nas the lung disease resulting from inhalation of coal dustparticles, especially in coal-miners engaged in handling softbituminous coal for a number of years, often 20 to 30 years.It exists in 2 forms—a milder form of the disease called simple\\ncoal workers’ pneumoconiosis  and an advanced form termed\\nprogressive massive fibrosis  (complicated coal-miners’\\npneumoconiosis). Anthracosis,  on the other hand, is not a lung\\ndisease in true sense but is the common, benign andasymp tomatic accumulation of carbon dust in the lungs of\\nmost urban dwellers due to atmospheric pollution and\\ncigarette smoke ( anthacite  refers to coal). Anthracotic pigment\\nis deposited in the macrophages in the alveoli and aroundthe respiratory bronchioles and into the draining lymphnodes but does not produce any respiratory difficulty or\\nradiologic changes.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Pathogenetically, it appears that\\nanthracosis, simple coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis and\\nprogressive massive fibrosis are different stages in the evolu-\\ntion of fully-developed coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis.However, progressive massive fibrosis develops in a smallproportion of cases (2-8%) of simple coal-workers’ pneumo-coniosis. A number of predisposing factors have beenimplicated in this transformation as follows:\\n1.Older age of the miners.\\n2.Severity of coal dust burden engulfed by macrophages.\\n3.\\nProlonged exposure (20 to 30 years) to coal dust.\\n4. Concomitant tuberculosis.\\n5. Additional role of silica dust.\\nActivation of alveolar macrophage plays the most\\nsignificant role in the pathogenesis of progressive massivefibrosis by release of various mediators (Fig. 17.26,A) :\\ni)Free radicals  which are reactive oxygen species which\\ndamage the lung parenchyma.ii)Chemotactic factors  for various leucocytes (leukotrienes,\\nTNF, IL-8 and IL-6) resulting in infiltration into pulmonary\\ntissues by these inflammatory cells which on activation cause\\nfurther damage.iii) Fibrogenic cytokines  such as IL-1, TNF and platelet derived\\ngrowth factor (PDGF) which stimulate healing by fibrosis\\ndue to prolife ration of fibroblasts at the damaged tissue site.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  In life, the pathologic\\nchanges in lung in coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis aregraded by radiologic appearance according to the size andextent of opacities. The pathologic findings at autopsy oflungs in the major forms of coal-workers’ pneumoconiosisare considered below under 3 headings: simple coal-\\nworkers’ pneumoconiosis, progressive massive fibrosisand rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (Caplan’s syndrome).\\nSIMPLE COAL-WORKERS’ PNEUMOCONIOSIS.\\nGrossly,  the lung parenchyma shows small, black focal\\nlesions, measuring less than 5 mm in diameter and evenlydistributed throughout the lung but have a tendency tobe more numerous in the upper lobes. These are termedcoal macules,  and if palpable are called nodules.  The air\\nspaces around coal macules are dilated with littledestruction of alveolar walls  (Fig. 17.26,A) . Though some\\nworkers have called it centrilobular emphysema of coal-miners (page 481), others prefer not to consider itemphysema because there is no significant destruction ofalveolar walls. Similar blackish pigmentations are foundon the pleural surface and in the regional lymph nodes(Fig. 17.27) .\\nHistologically,  the following features are seen (Fig. 17.28) :\\n1.Coal macules are composed of aggregates of dust-\\nladen macrophages. These are present in the alveoli andin the bronchiolar and alveolar walls.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 17.9: Classification of Pneumoconioses.\\nAgent Diseases\\nA. INORGANIC (MINE\\nRAL) DUSTS\\n1.

There is some increase in the network of reticulin and\\ncollagen in the coal macules.\\n3. Respiratory bronchioles and alveoli surrounding the\\nmacules are distended without significant destruction ofthe alveolar walls.\\nPROGRESSIVE MASSIVE FIBROSIS.  Grossly,  besides\\nthe coal macules and nodules of simple pneumoconiosis,\\nthere are larger, hard, black scattered areas measuringmore than 2 cm in diameter and sometimes massive. Theyare usually bilateral and located more often in the upperparts of the lungs posteriorly. Sometimes, these massesbreak down centrally due to ischaemic necrosis or due totuberculosis forming cavities filled with black semifluidresembling India ink. The pleura and the regional lymphnodes are also blackened and fibrotic  (Fig. 17.27) .\\nHistologically,  the following features are present:\\n1.The fibrous lesions are composed almost entirely of\\ndense collagen and carbon pigment.2. The wall of respiratory bronchioles and pulmonaryvessels included in the massive scars are thickened andtheir lumina obliterated.\\nFigure 17.26 Pathogenesis of three common forms of pneumoconiosis. A, Coal-workers’  pneumoconiosis . The macrophages phagocytose\\nlarge amount of coal dust particles which are then passed into the interstitial tissue of the lung and aggregate around respira tory bronchiole and\\ncause focal dust emphysema. B, Silicosis.  The tiny silica particles are toxic to macrophages. The dead macrophages release fibrogenic factor and\\neventually result in silicotic nodule. C, Asbestosis . Asbestos fibres initiate lot of interstitial fibrosis and also form asbestos bodies.\\nFigure 17.27 Gross appearance of the lungs in simple coal-workers’\\npneumoconiosis (A) and progressive massive fibrosis (B).\\n490SECTION III Systemic Pathology3. There is scanty inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes\\nand plasma cells around the areas of massive scars.4. The alveoli surrounding the scars are markedlydilated.\\nProgressive massive fibrosis probably has immuno-\\nlogical pathogenetic basis as described above.\\nRHEUMATOID PNEUMOCONIOSIS (CAPLAN’S\\nSYNDROME).  The development of rheumatoid arthritis\\nin a few cases of coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis, silicosisor asbestosis is termed rheumatoid pneumoconiosis orCaplan’s syndrome.\\nGrossly,  the lungs have rounded, firm nodules with\\ncentral necrosis, cavitation or calcification.\\nHistologically,  the lung lesions are modified rheumatoid\\nnodules with central zone of dust-laden fibrinoid necrosisenclosed by palisading fibroblasts and mononuclear cells.\\nThe lung lesions in Caplan’s syndrome have immuno-\\nlogical basis for their origin as evidenced by detection ofrheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.   Simple coal-workers’ pneumo-\\nconiosis is the mild form of disease characterised by chroniccough with black expectoration. The radiological findings ofnodularities in the lungs appear after working for severalyears in coal-mines. Progressive massive fibrosis is, however,a serious disabling condition manifested by progressivedyspnoea and chronic cough with jet-black sputum.Recurrent bacterial infections may produce purulent sputum.More advanced cases develop pulmonary hypertension andright ventricular hypertrophy (cor pulmonale). The radio-logical appearance may suggest tuberculosis or cancer.Tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis are more common incoal miners than the general population. Coal workers haveincreased risk of developing carcinomas of the stomach,probably due to swallowing of coal dust containing\\ncarcin ogens. But bronchogenic carcinoma does not appear\\nto be more common in coal-miners than in other groups.\\nSilicosis\\nHistorically, silicosis used to be called ‘knife grinders’ lung.\\nSilicosis is caused by prolonged inhalation of silicon dioxide,commonly called silica. Silica constitutes about one-fourthof earth’s crust. Therefore, a number of occupations engagedin silceous rocks or sand and products manufactured fromthem are at increased risk. These include miners (e.g. of\\ngranite, sandstone, slate, coal, gold, tin and copper), quarry\\nworkers, tunnellers, sandblasters, grinders, ceramic workers,foundry workers and those involved in the manufacture ofabrasives containing silica. Peculiar to India are the occu-pational exposure to pencil, slate and agate-grinding industrycarrying high risk of silicosis (agate = very hard stone\\ncontaining silica). According to an Indian Council of Medical\\nResearch report, it is estimated that about 3 million workersin India are at high potential risk of silica exposure employedin a variety of occupations including construction workers.An infrequent acute form of silicosis called accelerated silicosis\\nproduces irregular fibrosis adjoining the alveoli which is\\nfilled with lipoproteinaceous exudate and resembles alveolar\\nproteinosis (page 494). However, if not specified, silicosisrefers to the common chronic form  of the disease characterised\\nby formation of small collagenous silicotic nodules.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Silicosis appears after prolonged\\nexposure to silica dust, often a few decades. Besides, it\\ndepends upon a number of other factors such as total dose,\\nduration of exposure, the type of silica inhaled and individualhost factors. The mechanisms involved in the formation ofsilicotic nodules are not clearly understood. The followingsequence of events has been proposed and schematicallyillustrated in Fig. 17.26, B :\\n1.Silica particles between 0.5 to 5 μm size on reaching the\\nalveoli are taken by the macrophages which undergonecrosis. New macrophages engulf the debris and thus a\\nrepetitive cycle of phagocytosis and necrosis  is set up.\\n2.Some silica-laden macrophages are carried to the respi-\\nratory bronchioles, alveoli and in the interstitial tissue. Some\\nof the silica dust is transported to the subpleural and\\ninterlobar lymphatics and into the regional lymph nodes. The\\ncellular aggregates  containing silica become associated with\\nlymphocytes, plasma cells, mast cells and fibroblasts.\\n3\\n. Silica dust is fibrogenic.  Crystalline form, particularly\\nquartz, is more fibrogenic than non-crystalline form of silica.4. Simultaneously, there is activation of T and B lymphocytes.\\nThis results in increased serum levels of immunoglobulins\\n(IgG and IgM), antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor and\\ncirculating immune complexes as well as proliferation of T\\ncells.\\n5. As noted above, silica is cytotoxic  and kills the macro-\\nphages which engulf it. The released silica dust activates\\nviable macrophages leading to secretion of macrophage-\\nderived growth factors such as interleukin-1 that favourfibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis.Figure 17.28 Histologic appearance of the lung in coal-workers’\\npneumoconiosis. Coal macules composed of aggregates of dust-laden\\nmacrophages and collagens are seen surrounding respiratorybronchioles. The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles surrounding the coalmacule are distended.\\n491CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory SystemMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the chronic silico-\\ntic lung is studded with well-circumscribed, hard, fibrotic\\nnodules, 1 to 5 mm in diameters. They are scatteredthroughout the lung parenchyma but are initially moreoften located in the upper zones of the lungs. Thesenodular lesions frequently have simultaneous depositionof coal-dust and may develop calcification. The pleura isgrossly thickened and adherent to the chest wall. Theremay be similar fibrotic nodules on the pleura and withinthe regional lymph nodes. The nodular lesions aredetectable as egg-shell shadows in chest X-rays. Thelesions may undergo ischaemic necrosis and developcavitation, or be complicated by tuberculosis andrheumatoid pneumoconiosis  (Fig. 17.29) .\\nHistologically,  the following features are observed\\n(Fig. 17.30) :1. The silicotic nodules are located in the region of\\nrespiratory bronchioles, adjacent alveoli, pulmonary\\narteries, in the pleura and the regional lymph nodes.\\n2. The silicotic nodules  consist of central hyalinised\\nmaterial with scanty cellularity and some amount of dust.\\nThe hyalinised centre is surrounded by concentriclaminations of collagen which is further enclosed by more\\ncellular connective tissue, dust-filled macrophages and a\\nfew lymphocytes and plasma cells. Some of these nodulesmay have calcium deposits.3.\\nThe collagenous nodules have cleft-like spaces\\nbetween the lamellae of collagen which when examinedpolariscopically may demonstrate numerous birefringentparticles of silica.4. The severe and progressive form of the disease may\\nresult in coalescence of adjacent nodules and cause\\ncomplicated silicosis similar to progressive massivefibrosis of coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis (describedabove).\\n5. The intervening lung parenchyma may show\\nhyperinflation or emphysema.6. Cavitation when present may be due to ischaemicnecrosis in the nodules, or may reveal changes of tuber-\\nculosis or rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (Caplan’s\\nsyndrome), discussed already.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The functional effects of silicosis\\ndevelop slowly and insidiously. The main presenting\\ncomplaint is dyspnoea. In time, the patient may developfeatures of obstructive or restrictive pattern of disease. Othercomplications such as pulmonary tuberculosis, rheumatoidarthritis (Caplan’s syndrome) and cor pulmonale may occur.The chest radiograph initially shows fine nodularity, whilelater there are larger and coalescent nodules. Silicosis doesnot carry increased risk of developing bronchogeniccarcinoma.Figure 17.29 Gross appearance of the lung in silicosis, diagram-\\nmatic appearance.\\nFigure 17.30 Microscopic picture of the lung in silicosis. The silicotic nodule consists of hyaline centre surrounded by concentric layers o f\\ncollagen which are further enclosed by fibroblasts and dust-laden macrophages. Polarising microscopy in photomicrograph on right shows bright\\nfibres of silica.\\n492SECTION III Systemic PathologyAsbestos Disease\\nAsbestos as a mineral is known to mankind for more than\\n4000 years but its harmful effects have come to light duringthe last few decades. Asbestos is a Greek word meaning‘unquenchable’. In general, if coal is lot of dust and little fibrosis,\\nasbestos is little dust and a lot of fibrosis.  Prolonged exposure\\nfor a number of years to asbestos dust produces three typesof severe diseases: asbestosis of lungs, pleural disease and\\ntumours. In nature, asbestos exists as long thin fibrils which\\nare fire-resistant and can be spun into yarns and fabricssuitable for thermal and electrical insulation and has manyapplications in industries. Particularly at risk are workersengaged in mining, fabrication and manufacture of a numberof products from asbestos such as asbestos pipes, tiles, roofs,textiles, insulating boards, sewer and water conduits, brakelining, clutch castings etc.\\nThere are two major geometric forms of asbestos:Serpentine  consisting of curly and flexible fibres. It\\nincludes the most common chemical form chrysotile  (white\\nasbestos) comprising more than 90% of commercially usedasbestos.\\nAmphibole  consists of straight, stiff and rigid fibres. It\\nincludes the less common chemical forms crocidolite  (blue\\nasbestos),  amosite  (brown asbestos), tremolite, anthophyllite  and\\nactinolyte.  However, the group of amphibole, though less\\ncommon, is more important since it is associated withinduction of malignant pleural tumours, particularly inassociation with crocidolite.\\nHowever, in view of long term harmful effects of asbestos\\nexposure, it has been mostly replaced with synthetic mineralfibres such as fiberglass in developed countries since 1975but it continues to be used in developing countries of theworld.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Overexposure to asbestos for more than\\na decade may produce asbestosis of the lung, pleural lesions\\nand certain tumours. How asbestos causes all these lesionsis not clearly understood but the following mechanisms havebeen suggested (Fig. 17.26,C) :\\n1.The inhaled asbestos fibres are phagocytosed by alveolar\\nmacrophages  from where they reach the interstitium. Some of\\nthe engulfed dust is transported via lymphatics to the pleuraand regional lymph nodes.2. The asbestos-laden macrophages release chemo-attractants\\nfor neutrophils and for more macrophages, thus incitingcellular reaction around them.3.\\nAsbestos fibres are coated with glycoprotein and\\nendogenous haemosiderin to produce characteristic beadedor dumbbell-shaped asbestos bodies.\\n4. All types of asbestos are  fibrogenic and result in interstitial\\nfibrosis. Fibroblastic proliferation may occur via macrophage-derived growth factor such as interleukin-1. Alternatively,fibrosis may occur as a reparative response to tissue injuryby lysosomal enzymes released from macrophages andneutrophils or by toxic free radicals.5. A few immunological abnormalities  such as antinuclear\\nantibodies and rheumatoid factor have been found in casesof asbestosis but their role in the genesis of disease is notclear.6. Asbestos fibres are carcinogenic,  the most carcinogenic\\nbeing crocidolite. There is high incidence of bronchogeniccarcinoma in asbestosis which is explained on the basis ofthe role of asbestos fibres as tumour promoters or by causingcell death of the airways so that it is exposed to thecarcinogenic effect of cigarette smoke. The development ofpleural mesothelioma in these cases is probably by carryingof asbestos fibres via lymphatics to the pleura.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  As stated already, over-\\nexposure to asbestos is associated with 3 types of lesions:asbestosis, pleural disease and certain tumours.\\nA. ASBESTOSIS.  The gross pulmonary fibrosis caused\\nby asbestos exposure and histologic demonstration of\\nasbestos bodies on asbestos fibres is termed asbestosis.Grossly,  the affected lungs are small and firm with\\ncartilage-like thickening of the pleura. The sectionedsurface shows variable degree of pulmonary fibrosis,especially in the subpleural areas and in the bases of lungs\\n(Fig. 17.31). The advanced cases may show cystic changes.\\nHistologically,  the following changes are observed:\\n1.There is non-specific interstitial fibrosis.\\n2. There is presence of characteristic asbestos bodies  in the\\ninvolved areas (Fig. 17.32) . These are asbestos fibres coated\\nwith glycoprotein and haemosiderin and appear beadedor dumbbell-shaped. The coating stains positively forPrussian blue reaction.Figure 17.31 Gross appearance of the lung in asbestosis, diagram-\\nmatic appearance.\\nFigure 17.32 Microscopic appearance of asbestos body. An\\nasbestos body is an asbestos fibre coated with glycoprotein and\\nhaemosiderin giving it beaded or dumbbell-shaped appearance withbulbous ends.\\n493CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory System3. There may be changes of emphysema in the\\npulmonary parenchyma between the areas of interstitialfibrosis.4. The involvement of hilar lymph nodes in asbestosis isnot as significant as in silicosis.\\nB. PLEURAL DISEASE.  Pleural disease in asbestos\\nexposure may produce one of the following 3 types of\\nlesions:\\n1. Pleural effusion.  It develops in about 5% of asbestos\\nworkers and is usually serious type. Pleural effusion is\\ngenerally accompanied by subpleural asbestosis.\\n2. Visceral pleural fibrosis.  Quite often, asbestosis is\\nassociated with dense fibrous thickening of the visceral\\npleura encasing the lung.\\n3. Pleural plaques.  Fibrocalcific pleural plaques are the\\nmost common lesions associated with asbestos exposure.\\nGrossly,  the lesions appear as circumscribed, flat, small\\n(upto 1 cm in diameter), firm or hard, bilateral nodules.They are seen more often on the posterolateral part ofparietal pleura and on the pleural surface of thediaphragm.Microscopically,  they consist of hyalinised collagenous\\ntissue which may be calcified so that they are visible onchest X-ray. Asbestos bodies are generally not foundwithin the plaques.\\nC. TUMOURS.  Asbestos exposure predisposes to a\\nnumber of cancers, most importantly bronchogenic\\ncarcinoma (page 496) and malignant mesothelioma (page505). A few others are: carcinomas of oesophagus,stomach, colon, kidneys and larynx and various lymphoidmalignancies.\\n1. Bronchogenic carcinoma  is the most common\\nmalignancy in asbestos workers. Its incidence is 5 times\\nhigher in non-smoker asbestos workers than the non-smoker general population and 10 times higher in smokerasbestos workers than the other smokers.\\n2. Malignant mesothelioma  is an uncommon tumour\\nbut association with asbestos exposure is present in 30 to\\n80% of cases with mesothelioma. The exposure need notbe heavy because mesothelioma is known to develop inpeople living near asbestos plants or in wives of asbestosworkers.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Asbestosis is a slow and insidious\\nillness. The patient may remain asymptomatic for a numberof years in spite of radiological evidence of calcific pleuralplaques and parenchymatous changes. However, onset ofinterstitial fibrosis brings about dyspnoea with dry orproductive cough. More advanced cases show developmentof Caplan’s syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, corpulmonale and various forms of cancers.\\nBerylliosis\\nBerylliosis is caused by heavy exposure to dust or fumes of\\nmetallic beryllium or its salts. Beryllium was used in the pastin fluorescent tubes and light bulbs but currently it isprincipally used in nuclear and aerospace industries and inthe manufacture of electrical and electronic equipments. Twoforms of pulmonary berylliosis are recognised— acute   and\\nchronic.\\nACUTE BERYLLIOSIS.  Acute berylliosis occurs in\\nindividuals who are unusually sensitive to it and are heavily\\nexposed to it for 2 to 4 weeks. The pulmonary reaction is inthe form of an exudative chemical pneumonitis in which thealveoli are filled with protein-rich fluid with formation ofhyaline membrane. The patient develops sudden dyspnoea,hyperapnoea and substernal pain. Most patients recovercompletely.\\nCHRONIC BERYLLIOSIS.  Chronic berylliosis develops in\\nindividuals who are sensitised to it for a number of years,\\noften after a delay of 20 or more years. The disease is a cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction in which the metalberyllium acts as a hapten. The condition is characterised bydevelopment of non-caseating epithelioid granulomas likethose of sarcoidosis. These granulomas are diffusely scatteredthroughout the lung parenchyma. The granulomas havegiant cells which frequently contain 3 types of inclusions:1.Birefringent crystals.\\n2.\\nConcentrically-laminated haematoxyphilic Schaumann or\\nconchoid bodies.3. Acidophilic stellate-shaped asteroid bodies.\\nThese inclusions are described in giant cells of\\ngranulomas in sarcoidosis too (Chapter 6). Similar sarcoid-like granulomas can occur in other organs such as in the liver,kidneys, spleen or lymph nodes in chronic berylliosis.\\nILD ASSOCIATED WITH IMMUNOLOGIC LUNG DISEASES\\nHypersensitivity (Allergic) Pneumonitis\\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis is a group of immunologically-\\nmediated ILDs occurring in workers inhaling a variety oforganic (biologic) antigenic materials. The condition mayhave an acute  onset due to isolated exposure or may be chronic\\ndue to repeated low-dose exposure.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  A list of important organic\\n(biologic) dusts which may be inhaled to produce hyper-\\nsensitivity pneumonitis is already given in Table 17.9. Theimmunologic mechanisms underlying hypersensitivitypneumonitis from any of these causes appear to be eithertype III immune-complex disease or type IV delayed-hypersensitivity reaction.\\n1.Farmers’ lung  is the classic example resulting from\\nexposure to thermophilic actinomycetes generated by humid\\nand warm mouldy hay.\\n2\\n. Bagassosis  occurs in individuals engaged in manufacture\\nof paper and cardboard from sugarcane bagasse. Spores of\\nthermophilic actinomycetes grow rapidly in mouldysugarcane bagasse which are inhaled.\\n3. Byssinosis  is an occupational lung disease occurring in\\nworkers exposed to fibres of cotton, flex and hemp for a\\nnumber of years. The role of immunologic mechanisms inbyssinosis is not as clear as in exposure to other organic dusts.494SECTION III Systemic Pathology4. Bird-breeders’ (Bird-fanciers’) lung  occurs in pigeon\\nbreeders, parrot breeders, chicken farmers and bird-fanciers\\nwho are exposed to bird-droppings and danders from theirfeathers.\\n5. Mushroom-workers’ lung  is found in mushroom\\ncultivators exposed to mushroom compost dust.\\n6. Malt-workers’ lung  is seen in distillery and brewery\\nworkers who are exposed to mouldy barley and malt dust.7. Maple-bark disease  occurs in those involved in stripping\\nof maple bark and inhale mouldy maple bark (maple tree is\\ngrown in northern hemisphere for timber and its leaf is thenational emblem of Canada).\\n8. Silo-fillers’ disease  occurs in individuals who enter the\\nsilo (silo is an airtight store-house of fodder for farm animals)\\nin which toxic fumes of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide areformed due to fermentation of silage. The condition isgenerally rapidly fatal; less often it may lead to ILD.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The pathologic changes\\nprimarily involve the alveoli in contrast to bronchiolarinvolvement in asthma. The changes vary depending uponwhether the biopsy is examined in early stage or in latestage.\\nIn early stage,  the alveolar walls are diffusely infiltrated\\nwith lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. Aproportion of cases show granulomas consisting ofhistiocytes and giant cells of foreign body or Langhans’type.\\nIn chronic cases,  the lungs show interstitial fibrosis with\\nsome inflammatory infiltrate. Honeycombing of the lungmay be present.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical features vary according\\nto the stage. In acute cases, there is generally sudden attackof fever, myalgia, dyspnoea, cough and leucocytosis. In morechronic cases, there are signs of slowly progressiverespiratory failure, dyspnoea and cyanosis as seen in otherinterstitial lung diseases.\\nPulmonary Infiltrates with Eosinophilia\\nPulmonary eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonias or\\npulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia (PIE) syndrome area group of immunologically-mediated lung diseasescharacterised by combination of 2 features:\\nInfiltration of the lungs in chest radiographs.\\nElevated eosinophil count in the peripheral blood.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  PIE syndrome has a number of\\ndiverse causes and pathogenesis. These are as under:\\n1.Löeffler’s syndrome  is characterised by eosinophilia in\\nthe blood and typical wandering radiologic shadows,\\nappearing in some part of the lung for a few days, and thendisappearing to appear again somewhere else in the lung.The condition is generally self-limiting and mild, associatedwith slight fever and a few respiratory symptoms. Theetiology is unknown.\\n2.\\nTropical pulmonary eosinophilia  is caused by the\\npassage of larvae of worms through the lungs e.g. in filariasis,\\nascariasis, strongyloidosis, toxocariasis and ancylostomiasis.3. Secondary chronic pulmonary eosinophilia occurs\\nsecondary to adverse drug reactions; infection with fungi,bacteria, and helminths; allergic bronchopulmonaryaspergillosis and in association with asthma.\\n4. Idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is\\ncharacterised by prominent focal areas of consolidation of\\nthe lung. The condition is clinically diagnosed by excludingother known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia.\\n5. Hypereosinophilic syndrome  is occurrence of eosino-\\nphilia of over 1500/ μl for more than 6 months without any\\nidentifiable cause and without eosinophilic infiltrates in the\\nlungs and other organs.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The lesions in the lungs\\nare similar in all cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.Grossly,  the lungs usually show patchy consolidation.\\nMicroscopically,  there is thickening of the alveolar walls\\nby oedema and exudate, chiefly of eosinophils, and somelymphocytes and plasma cells. The alveolar lumina alsocontain eosinophils. Occasionally, small granulomas maybe present.\\nGoodpasture’s Syndrome\\nGoodpasture’s syndrome or pulmonary haemorrhage\\nsyndrome is combination of necrotising haemorrhagicinterstitial pneumonitis and rapidly progressiveglomerulonephritis. The renal lesions of Goodpasture’ssyndrome are described in Chapter 22.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The condition results from\\nimmunologic damage produced by anti-basement membrane\\nantibodies formed against antigens common to theglomerular and pulmonary basement membranes. Thetrigger for initiation of this autoimmune response is not clear;it could be virus infection, exposure to hydrocarbons andsmoking.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the lungs are\\nheavy with red-brown areas of consolidation.Microscopically,  the features vary according to the stage\\nof the disease:\\nIn acute stage,  there are focal areas of haemorrhages in\\nthe alveoli and focal necrosis in the alveolar walls.\\nIn more chronic cases,  there is organisation of the\\nhaemorrhage leading to interstitial fibrosis and filling ofalveoli with haemosiderin-laden macrophages.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The condition occurs commonly in\\n2nd or 3rd decades of life with preponderance in males. Thepulmonary manifestations generally precede the renaldisease. Most cases present with haemoptysis accompaniedwith dyspnoea, fatigue, weakness and anaemia. Renalmanifestations soon appear which include haematuria,proteinuria, uraemia and progressive renal failure.\\nPulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis\\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare chronic disease in\\nwhich the distal airspaces of the lungs are filled withgranular, PAS-positive, eosinophilic material with abundant495CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory Systemlipid in it. The condition can occur at any age from infancy\\nto old age.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The etiology and pathogenesis of\\nalveolar proteinosis are unknown. A number of possibilities\\nhave been suggested:\\nSince the alveolar material is combination of lipid and\\nprotein, it is not simply an overproduction of surfactant.\\nAlveolar proteinosis may have an occupational etiology\\nas seen in patients heavily exposed to silica.\\nIt may have an etiologic association with haematologic\\nmalignancies.\\nThere may be defective alveolar clearance of debris.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  usually both\\nlungs are involved, particularly the lower lobes. The lungsare heavier with areas of consolidation. Sectioned surfaceexudes abundant turbid fluid.Histologically,  the hallmark of the condition is presence\\nof homogeneous, granular, eosinophilic material whichstains brightly with PAS. Often, the material containscholesterol clefts. There is no significant inflammatoryinfiltrate in the affected alveoli. Biochemically, the materialconsists of serum proteins of low molecular weight,cholesterol and phospholipids similar to surfactant.Electron microscopy reveals that the material consists ofnecrotic alveolar macrophages and desquamated alveolarepithelial cells.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The condition is manifested\\nclinically by dyspnoea, cough, chest pain, pyrexia, fatigueand loss of weight. Chest X-ray shows confluent areas ofconsolidation. Occasionally, alveolar proteinosis may recoverspontaneously but more often it is a fatal condition.\\nILD ASSOCIATED WITH\\nCONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES\\nA number of connective tissue diseases or collagen diseases\\nmay result in chronic interstitial fibrosis and destruction ofblood vessels. These diseases are described in detail inChapter 4 but the lung involvement in important forms ofcollagen diseases is briefly considered here.\\n1. SCLERODERMA (PROGRESSIVE SYSTEMIC\\nSCLEROSIS).  The lungs are involved in 80% cases of\\nscleroderma. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is the mostcommon form of pulmonary involvement. The diseaseusually involves the lower lobes and subpleural regions ofthe lungs and may lead to honeycombing of the lung. Thereis increased risk of development of cancer of the lung inpulmonary fibrosis in scleroderma.\\n2. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.  Pulmonary involvement\\nin rheumatoid arthritis may result in pleural effusion,\\ninterstitial pneumonitis, necrobiotic nodules and rheumatoidpneumoconiosis (Caplan’s syndrome, page 490). Theparenchymatous lesions in rheumatoid arthritis are mostcommonly seen in the lower lobe. Necrobiotic nodules arethe most specific manifestations of rheumatoid disease andclosely resemble the subcutaneous nodules commonly foundin rheumatoid arthritis.3. SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS.  Patients with\\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly developsome form of lung disease during the course. The mostcommon manifestation of SLE is pleurisy with small amountof pleural effusion that may contain LE cells. Otherpulmonary lesions in SLE are interstitial pneumonitis,pulmonary haemorrhage and vasculitis.\\n4. SJÖGREN’S SYNDROME.  Patients with Sjögren’s\\nsyndrome often have rheumatoid arthritis and associated\\npulmonary changes. Involvement of the bronchial mucousgland by a process similar to that in the salivary glands canlead to inadequate bronchial clearance and repeatedinfections.\\n5. DERMATOMYOSITIS AND POLYMYOSITIS.\\nInterstitial pneumonitis and interstitial fibrosis commonlyaccompany dermatomyositis and polymyositis.\\n6. WEGENER’S GRANULOMATOSIS.  Wegener’s\\ngranulomatosis is an necro-inflammatory lesion having\\n4 components—granulomas of the upper respiratory tract,\\ngranulomas of the lungs, systemic vasculitis (page 403) andfocal necrotising glomerulonephritis. Localised or limited form\\nof the disease occurs in the lungs without involvement ofother organs. Pulmonary involvement is in the form of singleor multiple granulomas.\\nMicroscopically,  these granulomas have foci of fibrinoid\\nnecrosis and intense infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cellsand macrophages with scattered multinucleate giant cells.Besides necrotising granulomas, there is associatedvasculitis.\\nIDIOP A\\nTHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS\\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common form of\\ndiffuse interstitial pneumonia and has bad prognosiscompared with other forms of lung fibrosis. Diffuse inter-stitial fibrosis can occur as a result of a number of pathologic\\nentities such as pneumoconiosis, hypersensitivity\\npneumonitis and collagen-vascular disease. However, in halfthe cases of diffuse interstitial fibrosis, no apparent cause orunderlying disease is identifiable. Such cases are included\\nunder the entity ‘idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis’  in the United\\nStates and ‘cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis’ in Britain.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmo-\\nnary fibrosis is unknown and the condition is diagnosed byexcluding all known causes of interstitial fibrosis. However,\\na few evidences point toward immunologic mechanism:1.High levels of autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor\\nand antinuclear antibodies.\\n2.Elevated titres of circulating immune complexes.\\n3\\n. Immunofluorescent demonstration of the deposits of\\nimmunoglobulins and complement on the alveolar walls in\\nbiopsy specimens.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The lung involvement in\\nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is often bilateral and\\nwidespread.496SECTION III Systemic PathologyGrossly,  the lungs are firm, heavier with reduced volume.\\nHoneycombing (i.e. enlarged, thick-walled air spaces)\\ndevelops in parts of lung, particularly in the subpleuralregion.Histologically,  the changes vary according to the stage\\nof the disease.\\nIn early stage,  there is widening of the alveolar septa\\nby oedema and cellular infiltrate by mononuclearinflammatory cells. The alveolar lining cells may showhyperplasia at places and are flattened at other places.There is often formation of hyaline membranes. Thealveolar spaces contain exudate consisting ofmacrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Many of themacrophages contain lamellar bodies derived fromsurfactant of the necrotic alveolar lining epithelial cells.Based on the observation of desquamative component inthe cellular exudate, some authors label the early stage ofidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as ‘desquamative interstitial\\npneumonitis’.\\nIn advanced stage,  there is organisation of the alveolar\\nexudate and replacement fibrosis in the alveoli as well asin the interstitial septal wall with variable amount ofinflammation. Eventually, there are small cystic areas(honeycomb lung) with alternating areas of fibrosiscontaining thick-walled and narrowed vessels. This stageis often referred to as ‘chronic interstitial pneumonitis’  or\\n‘usual interstitial pneumonitis’.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Middle-aged males are affected\\nmore frequently. The usual features are of respiratorydifficulty beginning with dry cough and slowly progressingdyspnoea. More advanced cases may develop clubbing offingers and cor pulmonale. A rapidly progressive form ofthe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with death within 6 weeksto 6 months is termed Hamman-Rich syndrome.\\nILD ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING\\nLong-term consequences of smoking is associated with\\nfollowing non-neoplastic respiratory insufficiency:\\nSmoking-related COPD:   due to chronic bronchitis and\\nemphysema.\\nSmoking-related ILD:  i.e. chronic restrictive pulmo-\\nnary disease due to desquamative interstitial pneumonia(DIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated ILD, andpulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilicgranuloma of the lung).\\nDESQUAMATIVE INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA (DIP).\\nIt is an uncommon condition occurring exclusively insmokers in 4th to 5th decades of life and is more common inmales. Most patients present with dyspnoea and cough.Chest X-ray shows peculiar diffuse hazy opacities whichcharacterize all ILDs. DIP was earlier thought to representforerunner lesion in the sequence of development ofidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, DIP has minimalfibrosis and has a far better prognosis on cessation of smokingcompared to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Microscopically, the features are as under:i)Hallmark finding is collections of large number of\\nintraalveolar macrophages having abundant cytoplasmand containing brown-black pigment and are termed assmokers’ macrophages.i\\ni) The intervening septa contain a few lymphocytes,\\nplasma cells and an occasional eosinophil.iii) Late cases show mild interstitial fibrosis.\\nRESPIRATORY BRONCHIOLITIS-ASSOCIATED ILD.Respiratory bronchiolitis is a far more common lesion inchronic smokers than DIP and is considered a milder formof DIP having similar clinical presentation. Respiratorybronchiolitis-associated ILD is the term used for advancedcases who develop impaired pulmonary function andradiologic features.\\nThe condition resolves following cessation of smoking.\\nMicroscopically,  it is characterised by following features:\\ni) Patchy and bronchiolocentric location of similarsmokers’ macrophages as are seen in DIP.ii) Peribronchial infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes.iii) There may be mild peribronchial fibrosis.iv) Centriacinar emphysema may coexist.\\nPULMONARY LANGERHANS CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS.This is an uncommon smoking-related ILD occurring inyounger men (20-40 years). Clinically, the features may varyfrom an asymptomatic state to a rapidly progressive course.Symptomatic cases present with cough, dyspnoea, weightloss and fever. CT scan shows presence of ill-defined stellatenodules and thin-walled cysts.\\nDiscontinuation of smoking leads to reversal of the\\ncondition.\\nMicroscopically,  the features are as under:\\ni) There is presence of poorly-defined nodules distributedin peribronchiolar location while intervening lungparenchyma is uninvolved.ii) Characteristically, these nodules are sclerosing andcontain Langerhans cells along with other inflammatorycells.iii) Progressive cases have fibrosis with concomitant cysticchange.\\nTUMOURS OF LUNGS\\nA number of benign and malignant tumours occur in the\\nlungs but the primary lung cancer, commonly termedbronchogenic carcinoma, is the most common (95% of allprimary lung tumours). The lung is also the commonest sitefor metastasis from carcinomas and sarcomas. A histologicclassification of various benign and malignant tumours oflungs as recommended by the World Health Organisation isgiven in Table 17.10.\\nBRONCHOGENIC CARCINOMA\\nThe term bronchogenic carcinoma is commonly used for\\ncancer of the lungs which includes carcinomas arising from497CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory System\\nthe respiratory epithelium lining the bronchi, bronchioles and\\nalveoli.\\nINCIDENCE AND CLASSIFICATION.  Lung cancer is the\\nmost common primary malignant tumour in men and\\naccounts for nearly 30% of all cancer deaths in both sexes indeveloping countries. Currently, the incidence of lung cancerin females in the United States has already exceeded breastcancer as a cause of death in women. Cancer of the lung is adisease of middle and late life with peak incidence in 55-65years of age, after which there is gradual fall in its incidence.Of late, there has been slight decline in lung cancer deaths inmales due to smoking cessation efforts which started in theWest 4 decades back and has started yielding results.However, worldwide the scene on its incidence andprognosis are quite grim; data from International Agencyfor Research on Cancer estimate that worldwide by the year2030 there would be about 10 million deaths per year fromlung cancer.There are  5 main histologic types of lung cancer:\\ni)Squamous cell or epidermoid carcinoma\\ni\\ni)  Small cell carcinoma\\niii)Adenocarcinoma (including bronchioalveolar\\ncarcinoma)iv) Large cell carcinomav) Combined squamous cell carcinoma and adeno-carcinoma (adenosquamous carcinoma).\\nAs per reports on international data for the last 25\\nyears, while there has been decline in the incidence ofsmall cell carcinoma, incidence of adenocarcinoma of thelung has risen and has surpassed squamous cell carcinomaas the most frequent histologic subtype of lung cancer.\\nHowever, for therapeutic purposes, bronchogenic\\ncarcinoma can be classified into 3 groups:1. Small cell carcinomas, SCC (20-25%)2. Non-small cell carcinomas, NSCC (70-75%) (includessquamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cellcarcinoma)3. Combined/mixed patterns (5-10%).\\nETIOLOGY.  The high incidence of lung cancer is associated\\nwith a number of etiologic factors, most important of whichis cigarette smoking.\\n1.Smoking.  The most important factor for high incidence\\nof all forms of bronchogenic carcinoma is tobacco smoking.About 80% of the lung cancer occurs in active smokers. Anumber of evidences support the positive relationship of lungcancer with tobacco smoking (see page 237):\\ni)\\nTotal dose: There is a direct statistical correlation between\\ndeath rate from lung cancer and the total amount of cigarettes\\nsmoked e.g.\\nAn average regular smoker has 10 times greater risk of\\ndeveloping lung cancer than a non-smoker.\\nThe risk of smokers of more than 2 packs (40 cigarettes)\\nper day for 20 years is 60-70 times greater than a non-smoker.\\nCessation of smoking by a regular smoker results in\\ngradual decline in the chances of developing lung cancer.After 10 years of abstinence from smoking, the risk declinesbut never returns to the non-smoker level.\\nPipe and cigar smokers, though have higher risk than\\nnon-smokers but are at lesser risk than cigarette smokers.\\nii) Histologic alterations: The association of tobacco\\nsmoking is strongest for squamous cell carcinoma and smallcell carcinoma of the lung. More than 90% of smokers havesequential epithelial changes in the respiratory tract in theform of squamous metaplasia, dysplasia and carcinoma in\\nsitu (Fig. 17.33) .\\niii)  Mechanism: How tobacco smoking causes lung cancer\\nis not quite clear. However, following facts have beenobserved:\\nAnalysis of the tar from cigarette smoke has revealed a\\nnumber of known carcinogens (e.g. polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons, nitrosamines) and tumour promoters (e.g.phenol derivatives).\\nIn experimental animal studies, it has been possible to\\ninduce cancer by skin painting experiments with smoke-tar.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 17.10: WHO Classification of Lung Tumours.\\nI.

SECONDARY TUMOURS498SECTION III Systemic PathologyHowever, it has not been possible to reproduce pattern of\\nhuman respiratory tract cancer, probably because of thedifficulty in reproducing human smoking methods inanimals.\\n2. Other factors. Although smoking is the dominant\\netiologic factor in lung cancer, 15% cases of lung cancer occur\\nin non-smokers, more so in women probably related tohormonal factors. A few other factors implicated in lungcancer are as follows:i) Atmospheric pollution.  There is increased risk of developing\\nbronchogenic carcinoma in non-smokers living inindustrialised and smoky cities than in the less polluted ruralareas. It is possible that specific industrial pollutants may beat fault as evidenced by high rates for lung cancer in peopleliving in the neighbourhood of petrochemical industries.ii) Occupational causes.  There are a number of well-esta-\\nblished occupational causes of lung cancer. These includeworkers exposed to asbestos, radiation of all types, bis-ethers,nickel, beryllium, arsenic, metallic iron and iron-oxide. Someindustrial carcinogens and cigarette smoking havecocarcinogenic effect, particularly in uranium mines andasbestos workers.iii)Dietary factors.  Susceptibility to respiratory cancers is\\nincreased in vitamin A deficiency. Smokers with low vitaminA intake have a greater risk of lung cancer than those withvitamin A-rich diet. The incidence of lung cancer is inverselyrelated to socioeconomic level reflecting their dietary pattern.iv) Chronic scarring.  Peripheral adenocarcinomas occur more\\nfrequently in areas of chronic scarring caused by chronicinflammatory changes, old tuberculosis, asbestosis, chronicinterstitial fibrosis, old infarcts and in scleroderma.\\nMOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS.  Molecular studies have\\nrevealed that there are several genetic alterations in cancer\\nstem cells which produce clones of malignant cells to formtumour mass. Following genetic changes have been found:\\n1. Activation of growth-promoting oncogenes:  Mutation in\\nK-RAS  oncogene has been seen as the dominant change in\\nlung cancer. Besides, there is mutation in tyrosine kinase\\ndomain of EGFR  oncogene in cases of adenocarcinoma lung\\nin non-smokers. Other mutations include BRAF , PIK3CA  andMYC  family, and overexpression of bcl-2 and other\\nantiapoptotic proteins.\\n2. Inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes.  Inactivation of\\ntumour suppressor genes has been found as another\\nmolecular mechanism in lung cancer. Many tumoursuppressor genes have been found on chromosome 3p in lungcancer cases. These include inactivation of  p53 and Rb gene.\\nBesides, some tumour-acquired promoter genes have beenidentified in lung cancer e.g. p16, RASSFIA  etc, which cause\\nloss of normal function of growth-regulatory tumoursuppressor genes.\\n3. Autocrine growth factors.  Studies have shown that lung\\ncancer is a multistep process—initiator carcinogen causing\\nmutation, followed by action of tumour promoters.  Nicotineacts as both initiator as well as promoter carcinogen.Derivatives of nicotine in  smoke unmask and expressesnicotine  acetylcholine receptors which activate the signalingpathway in tumour, blocking the  apoptosis. Promoters alsoinclude several hormones which are elaborated by lungcancer by autocrine pathway as part of paraneoplasticsyndrome.\\n4. Inherited predisposition.  Although not common, but there\\nare a few examples of inheritance of lung cancer as under:\\ni) Patients of Li-Fraumeni syndrome who inherit p53\\nmutation may develop lung cancer.ii) Clinical cases of retinoblastoma having mutation in Rb\\ngene are predisposed to develop lung cancer if they live upto adulthood.iii) First-degree relatives of lung cancer patients have a 2-3fold higher risk of developing lung cancer in their lifetime.iv) Mutations of cytochrome P450 system have beenidentified in lung cancer patients; P450 metabolises chemicalcarcinogen in tobacco smoke (page 216).\\n5. Molecular targets for therapy and survival prediction.\\nKnowledge on the insight into molecular biology andpathogenesis of lung cancer has applications in discoveringnewer molecules for targeted therapy, predicting responseto treatment and survival:i) EGFR mutations and NSCC therapy:  It has been reported\\nthat 70% cases of NSCC have overexpression of EGFR  proteinFigure 17.33 Schematic representation of sequential development of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.\\n499CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory Systemor amplification of the EGFR  gene. EGFR  belonging to ERBB\\n(HER)  family of protooncogenes through mutation in its\\ntyrosine kinase ( TK) domain plays a role in both extracelluar\\nand intracellular signaling resulting in tumour cell\\nproliferation, metastasis and antiapoptotic action. Targetedmolecular therapy against these mutations in EGFR  include\\nEGFR -TK inhibitor  oral therapy.\\nii) VEGF and monoclonal therapy:  Although not mutated, VEGF\\nis excessively produced in lung cancer and contributes totumour angiogenesis. Monoclonal antibody therapy againstEGFR in conjunction with chemotherapy has been used forcurtailing tumour angiogenesis in lung caner.iii) Molecular signature gene for prediction:  Recent proteomic\\nstudies at research level have shown that each patient hasunique protein pattern in the serum (i.e. molecularsignatures) which may be used for early diagnosis, predictdrug resistance, response to treatment and survival, but theseare yet to be applied in clinical settings.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Bronchogenic carcinoma\\ncan occur anywhere in the lung but the most commonlocation is hilar,  followed in descending frequency by\\nperipheral type.\\nGrossly,  these 2 main types show variation in appearance:\\n1. Hilar type (Fig. 17.34,A) : Most commonly, the lung\\ncancer arises in the main bronchus or one of its segmentalbranches in the hilar parts of the lung, more often on theright side. The tumour begins as a small roughened areaon the bronchial mucosa at the bifurcation. As the tumourenlarges, it thickens the bronchial mucosa producingnodular or ulcerated surface. As the nodules coalesce, thecarcinoma grows into a friable spherical mass, 1 to 5 cmin diameter, narrowing and occluding the lumen. The cutsurface of the tumour is yellowish-white with foci ofnecrosis and haemorrhages which may produce cavitarylesions ( Table 17.11  sums up a list of common conditions\\nhaving pulmonany cavitary lesions  or ‘honey-comb lung’during the course of different lung diseases). It is commonto find secondary changes in bronchogenic carcinoma oflung such as bronchopneumonia, abscess formation andbronchiectasis as a result of obstruction and intercurrentinfections. The tumour soon spreads within the lungs bydirect extension or by lymphatics, and to distant sites bylymphatic or haematogenous routes, as described later.\\n2.Peripheral type (Fig. 17.34,B) : A small proportion of\\nlung cancers, chiefly adenocarcinomas including\\nbronchioloalveolar carcinomas, originate from a smallperipheral bronchiole but the exact site of origin may notbe discernible. The tumour may be a single nodule ormultiple nodules in the periphery of the lung producingpneumonia-like consolidation of a large part of the lung.The cut surface of the tumour is greyish and mucoid.\\nHistologically,  as per the WHO classification outlined in\\nTable 17.10, five main histologic types of bronchogenic\\ncarcinoma are distinguished which is important becauseof prognostic and therapeutic considerations. However,from clinical point of view, distinction between small cell(SCC) and non-small cell carcinomas (NSCC) is importantbecause the two not only differ in morphology, but thereare major differences in immunophenotyping andresponse to treatment discussed above. The majordifferences between SCC and NSCC of the lung aresummed up in Table 17.12.\\n1.Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma:  This has been\\nthe most common histologic subtype of bronchogeniccarcinoma until recently and is found more commonly inmen, often with history of tobacco smoking. Thesetumours usually arise in a large bronchus and are proneto massive necrosis and cavitation  (Fig. 17.35) . The tumour\\nis diagnosed microscopically by identification of eitherintercellular bridges or keratinisation. The tumour mayshow varying histologic grades of differentiation such aswell-differentiated, moderately-differentiated and poorly-differentiated (Fig. 17.36) . Occasionally, a variant of\\nsquamous cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, having\\nbiphasic pattern of growth due to the presence of aFigure 17.34 The two main gross patterns of bronchogenic\\ncarcinoma.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 17.11: Conditions Producing Pulmonary Cavities\\n(Honeycomb Lung).\\nA.

Frequently,the edge of the growth and the adjoining uninvolvedbronchi show squamous metaplasia, epithelial dysplasiaand carcinoma in situ.\\n2. Small cell carcinoma:  Small cell carcinomas are\\nfrequently hilar or central in location, have strongrelationship to cigarette smoking and are highly malignanttumours. They are most often associated with ectopichormone production because of the presence ofneurosecretory granules in majority of tumour cells whichare similar to those found in argentaffin or Kulchitsky cellsnormally found in bronchial epithelium. By immuno-histochemistry, these tumour cells are positive forneuroendocrine markers: chromogranin, neuron-specificenolase (NSE) and synaptophysin. Small cell carcinomashave 3 subtypes:\\ni)Oat cell carcinoma  is composed of uniform, small cells,\\nlarger than lymphocytes with dense, round or oval nucleihaving diffuse chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and very\\nsparse cytoplasm ( oat =  a form of grain). These cells are\\norganised into cords, aggregates and ribbons or around\\nsmall blood vessels forming pseudorosettes (Fig. 17.37) .\\nii)Small cell carcinoma, intermediate cell type is composed of\\ncells slightly larger than those of oat cell carcinoma andhave similar nuclear characteristics but have more\\nabundant cytoplasm. These cells are organised into lobules.\\niii)Combined oat cell carcinoma  is a tumour in which there\\nis a definite component of oat cell carcinoma withsquamous cell and/or adenocarcinoma.\\n3. Adenocarcinoma:  Adenocarcinoma, also called\\nperipheral carcinoma  due to its location an\\nd scar carcinoma\\ndue to its association with areas of chronic scarring, is the\\nmost common bronchogenic carcinoma in women and is\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 17.12: Comparison of Features of Small Cell and Non-small Cell Carcinoma of the Lung.\\nFeature Small Cell Carcinoma Non-small Cell Carcinoma\\n1.

Prognosis Poor Better\\nFigure 17.35 Squamous cell carcinoma lung, hilar type. Sectioned\\nsurface shows grey-white fleshy tumour in the bronchus at its bifurcation\\nand occluding the lumen partly (arrow). The tumour is seen extendingdirectly into adjacent lung parenchyma and hilar nodes.501CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory Systemslow-growing. Recent estimates on adenocarcinoma place\\nthis as the most frequent histologic subtype of lung cancer.Adenocarcinoma is further subclassified into 4 types:\\ni)Acinar adenocarcinoma  which has predominance of\\nglandular structure and often occurs in the larger bronchi.\\nii)Papillary adenocarcinoma  which has a pronounced\\npapillary configuration and is frequently peripherally\\nlocated in the lungs and is found in relation to pulmonaryscars (scar carcinoma).\\niii)Bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma  is characterised by\\ncuboidal to tall columnar and mucus-secreting epithelial\\ncells growing along the existing alveoli and formingnumerous papillary structures (Fig. 17.38) . Ultrastruc-\\nturally, these tumour cells resemble Clara cells or less oftentype II pneumocytes.\\niv) Solid carcinoma  is a poorly-differentiated adenocarci-\\nnoma lacking acini, tubules or papillae but having mucus-\\ncontaining vacuoles in many tumour cells.4. Large cell carcinoma:  These are undifferentiated\\ncarcinomas which lack the specific features by which they\\ncould be assigned into squamous cell carcinoma oradenocarcinoma. Large cell carcinomas are more commonin men, have strong association with cigarette smoking\\nand are highly malignant tumours. The tumour cells have\\nlarge nuclei, prominent nucleoli, abundant cytoplasm andwell-defined cell borders. Variants of large cellundifferentiated carcinomas include giant cell carcinoma\\nwith prominence of highly pleomorphic multinucleatecells and clear cell carcinoma  composed of cells with clear\\nor foamy cytoplasm without mucin.\\n5.Adenosquamous carcinoma:  These are a small\\nproportion of peripheral scar carcinomas having clear\\nevidence of both keratinisation and glandular\\ndifferentiation.\\nSPREAD.  Bronchogenic carcinoma can invade the adjoin-\\ning structures directly, or may spread by lymphatic and\\nhaematogenous routes.\\nFigure 17.36 Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Islands of invading malignant squamous cells are seen. A few well-developed cell nests\\nwith keratinisation are evident.\\nFigure 17.37 Oat cell carcinoma of the lung. The tumour cells are arranged in sheets, cords or aggregates and at places form pseudorosettes.\\nThe individual tumour cells are small, uniform, lymphocyte-like with scanty cytoplasm.\\n502SECTION III Systemic Pathology1. Direct spread.  The tumour extends directly by invading\\nthrough the wall of the bronchus and destroys and replaces\\nthe peribronchial lung tissue. As it grows further, it spreadsto the opposite bronchus and lung, into the pleural cavity,the pericardium and the myocardium and along the greatvessels of the heart causing their constriction. Extension ofthe cancer located at the apex of the lung into the thoraciccage may involve brachial plexus and the sympathetic chaincausing pain and sensory disturbances, so called Pancoast’s\\nsyndrome.\\n2. Lymphatic spread.  Initially, hilar lymph nodes are\\naffected. Later, lymphatic metastases occur to the other\\ngroups leading to spread to mediastinal, cervical,supraclavicular and para-aortic lymph nodes. Invasion of thethoracic duct may produce chylous ascites.\\n3. Haematogenous spread.  Distant metastases via blood\\nstream are widespread and early. The sites affected, in\\ndescending order of involvement, are: the liver, adrenals,bones, pancreas, brain, opposite lung, kidneys and thyroid.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Symptoms of lung cancer are quite\\nvariable and result from local effects, effects due to occlusion\\nof a bronchus, direct and distant metastases, andparaneoplastic syndromes. Diagnostic aids include radiologicexamination and CT scan of the chest, cytologic examinationof the sputum, bronchial washings and bronchioalveolarlavage.\\n1. Local symptoms.  Most common local complaints are\\ncough, chest pain, dyspnoea and haemoptysis. (A list of\\nvarious causes of haemoptysis is summed up in Table 17.13 ).\\n2\\n. Bronchial obstructive symptoms.  Occlusion of a\\nbronchus may result in bronchopneumonia, lung abscess and\\nbronchiectasis in the lung tissue distal to the site ofobstruction and cause their attendant symptoms like fever,productive cough, pleural effusion and weight loss.\\n3\\n. Symptoms due to metastases.  Distant spread may\\nproduce varying features and sometimes these are the first\\nmanifestation of lung cancer. These include: superior venacaval syndrome, painful bony lesions, paralysis of recurrentnerve and other neurologic manifestations resulting frombrain metastases.\\n4. Paraneoplastic syndromes.  A number of paraneoplastic\\nsyndromes (page 231) are associated with lung cancer. These\\ninclude the following:\\ni)Ectopic hormone production:  Different hormonal\\nsyndromes are characteristic of different histologic types of\\nlung cancer. Small cell carcinomas are associated most oftenwith ectopic hormone production. The various hormoneselaborated by lung cancer are as follows:a) ACTH, producing Cushing’s syndrome.b) ADH, inducing hyponatraemia.c) Parathormone, causing hypercalcaemia.d) Calcitonin, producing hypocalcaemia.e) Gonadotropins, causing gynaecomastia.f) Serotonin, associated with carcinoid syndrome.\\nFigure 17.38 Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.

The widely accepted clinical\\nstaging of lung cancer is according to the TNM classification,\\ncombining features of primary Tumours, Nodal involvement\\nand distant Metastases. TNM staging divides all lung cancers\\ninto the following 4 stages:\\nOccult:  Malignant cells in the bronchopulmonary secretions\\nbut no evidence of primary tumour or metastasis.\\nStage I:  Tumour less than 3 cm, with or without ipsilateral\\nnodal involvement, no distant metastasis.\\nStage II:  Tumour larger than 3 cm, with ipsilateral hilar lymph\\nnode involvement, no distant metastasis.\\nStage III:  Tumour of any size, involving adjacent structures,\\ninvolving contralateral lymph nodes or distant metastasis.\\nIn general, tumour size larger than 5 cm has worse\\nprognosis. Symptomatic patients, particularly with systemic\\nsymptoms, fare far badly than the nonsymptomatic patients.The overall prognosis of bronchogenic carcinoma is dismal.However, 5-year survival rate with surgery combined withradiotherapy or chemotherapy in the last 30 years hasdoubled from its earlier rate of about 9% to present rate of15%. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma whichare localised, are resectable and have a slightly betterprognosis. Small cell carcinoma has the worst prognosis  since\\nsurgical treatment is ineffective though the tumour issensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\\nBRONCHIAL CARCINOID AND\\nOTHER NEUROENDOCRINE  TUMOURS\\nNeuroendocrine tumours of the lung represent a continuum\\nspectrum of lung tumours with progressively increasingaggressiveness which include: typical carcinoid ( least\\naggressive ), atypical carcinoid, and large cell endocrine\\ncarcinoma, and also small cell carcinoma ( most aggressive ).\\nAll these tumours arise from neuroendocrine (Kulchitsky)cells of bronchial mucosa. Formerly, bronchial carcinoidsused to be classified as ‘bronchial adenomas’ but now it isknown that they are locally invasive and have the capacityto metastasise. Bronchial carcinoids tend to occur at ayounger age than bronchogenic carcinoma, often appearingbelow the age of 40 years, and are not related to cigarettesmoking.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Bronchial carcinoids\\nresemble their intestinal counterparts described inChapter 20.Grossly,  bronchial carcinoids most commonly arise from\\na major bronchus and project into the bronchial lumen asa spherical polypoid mass, 3-4 cm in diameter. Lesscommonly, the tumour may grow into the bronchial walland produce collar-button like lesion. The overlyingbronchial mucosa is usually intact. Cut surface of thetumour is yellow-tan in colour.Histologically,  the tumour is composed of uniform\\ncuboidal cells forming aggregates, trabeculae or ribbonsseparated by fine fibrous septa. The tumour cells haveabundant, finely granular cytoplasm and oval centralnuclei with clumped nuclear chromatin. Mitoses are rareand necrosis is uncommon (Fig. 17.39) . The secretory\\ngranules of bronchial carcinoids resemble those of otherforegut carcinoids and stain positively with argyrophilicstains in which exogenous reducing agent is added forthe reaction. Immunohistochemically, markers forneuroendocrine stain positive and include NSE,chromogranin, synaptophysin and neurofilaments.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Bronchial carcinoids occur at a\\nrelatively early age and have equal sex incidence. Most ofthe symptoms in bronchial carcinoids occur as a result ofbronchial obstruction such as cough, haemoptysis, atelectasisand secondary infection. About 5-10% of bronchial carcinoidsmetastasise to the liver and these cases are capable ofproducing carcinoid syndrome (Chapter 20).\\nHAMARTOMA\\nHamartoma is a tumour-like lesion composed of an abnormal\\nadmixture of pulmonary tissue components and isdiscovered incidentally as a coin-lesion in the chest-X-ray.\\nFigure 17.39 Central carcinoid of the lung. The tumour shows a\\ncharacteristic nested of cells separated by fibrovascular septa. These\\nnests are composed of uniform cuboidal cells having granular cytoplasm.504SECTION III Systemic PathologyPulmonary hamartomas are of 2 types: chondromatous and\\nleiomyomatous.\\nChondromatous hamartoma  is more common and\\nusually asymptomatic. It forms a solitary, spherical mass,2-5 cm in diameter, usually at the periphery of the lung.Typically, it shows nodules of cartilage associated withfibrous and adipose tissue admixed with bronchialepithelium.\\nLeiomyomatous hamartoma  has a prominent smooth\\nmuscle component and bronchiolar structures. They arefrequently multiple, 1-2 mm in diameter and are morecommonly located near the pleura.\\nMETASTATIC LUNG TUMOURS\\nSecondary tumours of the lungs are more common than the\\nprimary pulmonary tumours. Metastases from carcinomasas well as sarcomas arising from anywhere in the body mayspread to the lung by haematogenous or lymphatic routes,or by direct extension. Blood-borne metastases are the mostcommon since emboli of tumour cells from any malignanttumour entering the systemic venous circulation are likelyto be lodged in the lungs. Metastases are most common inthe peripheral part of the lung forming single or multiple,discrete nodular lesions which appear radiologically as‘cannon-ball secondaries’ (Fig. 17.40) . Less frequently, the\\nmetastatic growth is confined to peribronchiolar andperivascular locations which is due to spread via lymphatics.\\nMost common sources of metastases in the lungs are:\\ncarcinomas of the bowel, breast, thyroid, kidney, pancreas,lung (ipsilateral or contralateral) and liver. Other tumourswhich frequently metastasise to the lungs are osteogenicsarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms’ tumour, melanoma,lymphomas and leukaemias.PLEURA\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nVisceral pleura covers the lungs and extends into the fissures\\nwhile the parietal pleura limits the mediastinum and coversthe dome of the diaphragm and inner aspect of the chest wall.The two layers between them enclose pleural cavity whichcontains less than 15 ml of clear serous fluid.\\nMicroscopically,  both the pleural layers are lined by a single\\nlayer of flattened mesothelial cells facing each other.\\nUnderneath the lining cells is a thin layer of connective tissue.\\nDiseases affecting the pleura are nearly always secondary\\nto some other underlying disease. Broadly, they fall intoinflammations, non-inflammatory pleural effusions,pneumothorax, and tumours.\\nINFLAMMATIONS\\nInflammatory involvement of the pleura is commonly termed\\npleuritis or pleurisy.  Depending upon the character of resultant\\nexudate, it can be divided into serous, fibrinous andserofibrinous, suppurative or empyema, and haemorrhagicpleuritis.\\n1. SEROUS, FIBRINOUS AND SEROFIBRINOUS\\nPLEURITIS.  Acute inflammation of the pleural sac (acute\\npleuritis) can result in serous, serofibrinous and fibrinousexudate. Most of the causes of such pleuritis are infective inorigin, particularly within the lungs, such as tuberculosis,pneumonias, pulmonary infarcts, lung abscess andbronchiectasis. Other causes include a few collagen diseases(e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and disseminated lupuserythematosus), uraemia, metastatic involvement of thepleura, irradiation of lung tumours and diffuse systemicinfections (e.g. typhoid fever, tularaemia, blastomycosis andcoccidioidomycosis).\\nPleurisy causes pain in the chest on breathing and a\\nfriction rub is audible on auscultation. In most patients, theexudate is minimal and is resorbed resulting in resolution.Repeated attacks of pleurisy may result in organisationleading to fibrous adhesions and obliteration of the pleuralcavity.\\n2. SUPPURATIVE PLEURITIS (EMPYEMA THORACIS).\\nBacterial or mycotic infection of the pleural cavity thatconverts a serofibrinous effusion into purulent exudate istermed suppurative pleuritis or empyema thoracis. The mostcommon cause is direct spread of pyogenic infection fromthe lung. Other causes are direct extension from subdia-phragmatic abscess or liver abscess and penetrating injuriesto the chest wall. Occasionally, the spread may occur byhaematogenous or lymphatic routes.\\nIn empyema, the exudate is yellow-green, creamy pus\\nthat accumulates in large volumes. Empyema is eventuallyreplaced by granulation tissue and fibrous tissue. In time,tough fibrocollagenic adhesions develop which obliterate thecavity, and with passage of years, calcification may occur.The effect of these is serious respiratory difficulty due toinadequate pulmonary expansion.\\nFigure 17.40 Metastatic deposits in the lung.  Large parts of the\\nlung parenchyma are replaced by multiple, variable-sized, circumscribed\\nnodular masses which are grey-white in colour. Some of these showareas of haemorrhage and necrosis.505CHAPTER 17 The Respiratory System3. HAEMORRHAGIC PLEURITIS.  Haemorrhagic\\npleuritis differs from haemothorax in having inflammatory\\ncells or exfoliated tumour cells in the exudate. The causes ofhaemorrhagic pleuritis are metastatic involvement of thepleura, bleeding disorders and rickettsial diseases.\\nNON-INFLAMMATORY PLEURAL EFFUSIONS\\nThese include fluid collections in the pleural cavity such as\\nhydrothorax, haemothorax and chylothorax.\\n1. HYDROTHORAX.  Hydrothorax is non-inflammatory\\naccumulation of serous fluid within the pleural cavities.\\nHydrothorax may be unilateral or bilateral depending uponthe underlying cause. Occasionally, an effusion is limited topart of a pleural cavity by preexisting pleural adhesions.\\nThe most common cause of hydrothorax, often bilateral,\\nis congestive heart failure. Other causes are renal failure,cirrhosis of liver, Meig’s syndrome (Chapter 24), pulmonaryoedema and primary and secondary tumours of the lungs.\\nThe non-inflammatory serous effusion in hydrothorax is\\nclear and straw-coloured and has the characteristics oftransudate with a specific gravity of under 1.012, proteincontent below 1 gm/dl and little cellular content.\\nIf the fluid collection in pleural cavity is less than 300 ml\\n(normal is less than 15 ml), no signs or symptoms areproduced and may be apparent in chest X-ray in standingposture as obliterated costodiaphragmatic angle. If thepleural cavity contains abundant fluid, it imparts acharacteristic opaque radiographic appearance to the affectedside with deviation of trachea to the opposite side. In suchcases, symptoms such as respiratory embarrassment anddyspnoea are produced which are promptly relieved onwithdrawal of fluid.\\n2. HAEMOTHORAX.  Accumulation of pure blood in the\\npleural cavity is termed as haemothorax. The most common\\ncauses of haemothorax are trauma to the chest wall or to thethoracic viscera and rupture of aortic aneurysm. It isimportant to remove the blood from the pleural cavity asearly as possible. Otherwise the blood will clot and organise,resulting in fibrous adhesions and obliteration of the pleuralcavity.\\n3. CHYLOTHORAX.  Chylothorax is an uncommon\\ncondition in which there is accumulation of milky fluid of\\nlymphatic origin into the pleural cavity. Chylothorax resultsmost commonly from rupture of the thoracic duct by traumaor obstruction of the thoracic duct such as by malignanttumours, most often malignant lymphomas. Chylothorax ismore often confined to the left side. Chylous effusion is milkydue to high content of finely emulsified fats in the chyle .\\nPNEUMOTHORAX\\nAn accumulation of air in the pleural cavity is called\\npneumothorax. It may occur in one of the three circum-stances: spontaneous, traumatic and therapeutic.\\ni)Spontaneous pneumothorax  occurs due to spontaneous\\nrupture of alveoli in any form of pulmonary disease. Most\\ncommonly, spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in associationwith emphysema, asthma and tuberculosis. Other causesinclude chronic bronchitis in an old patient, bronchiectasis,pulmonary infarction and bronchial cancer. In youngpatients, recurrent spontaneous rupture of peripheralsubpleural blebs may occur without any cause resulting indisabling condition termed spontaneous idiopathic\\npneumothorax.\\ni\\ni) Traumatic pneumothorax  is caused by trauma to the\\nchest wall or lungs, ruptured oesophagus or stomach, and\\nsurgical operations of the thorax.\\niii)Therapeutic (artificial) pneumothorax used to be\\nemployed formerly in the treatment of chronic pulmonary\\ntuberculosis in which air was introduced into the pleural sacso as to collapse the lung and limit its respiratory movements.\\nThe effects  of pneumothorax due to any cause depend\\nupon the amount of air collected in the pleural cavity. If thequantity of air in the pleura is small, it is resorbed. Largervolume of air collection in the pleural cavity causes dyspnoeaand pain in the chest. Pneumothorax causes lung collapseand pulls the mediastinum to the unaffected side.Occasionally, the defect in the lungs is such that it acts asflap-valve and allows entry of air during inspiration but doesnot permit its escape during expiration, creating tension\\npneumothorax  which requires urgent relief of pressure so as\\nto relieve severe dyspnoea and circulatory failure.\\nTUMOURS OF PLEURA\\nPleural tumours may be primary or secondary. In line with\\npulmonary tumours, the secondary tumours in the pleuraare more common. The only important primary tumour ofpleura is mesothelioma.\\nMESOTHELIOMA\\nMesothelioma is an uncommon tumour arising from\\nmesothelial lining of serous cavities, most often in pleuralcavity, and rarely in peritoneal cavity and pericardial sac.Mesotheliomas are of 2 types— benign (solitary) and malignant\\n(diffuse).  The biologic behaviour of pleural mesotheliomas is\\nusually predicted by their gross appearance—those formingsolitary, discrete masses are generally benign, whereas thosewhich grow diffusely are usually malignant.\\nBenign (Solitary) Mesothelioma\\nBenign or solitary mesothelioma is also called as pleural\\nfibroma. Asbestos exposure plays no role in etiology of benign\\nmesothelioma.\\nGrossly,  it consists of a solitary, circumscribed, small, firm\\nmass, generally less than 3 cm in diameter. Cut surfaceshows whorls of dense fibrous tissue.Microscopically,  the tumour is predominantly composed\\nof whorls of collagen fibres and reticulin with interspersedfibroblasts. Rarely, mesothelial-lined clefts are seen in thetumour.\\nBenign mesothelioma causes no symptoms and is\\ndetected as an incidental radiologic finding. Sometimes thetumour is associated with systemic syndrome of506SECTION III Systemic Pathologyosteoarthropathy or hypoglycaemia. Removal of the tumour\\nis generally curative.\\nMalignant (Diffuse) Mesothelioma\\nMalignant or diffuse mesothelioma is rare. It is a highly\\nmalignant tumour associated with high mortality. Thetumour is significant in view of its recognised association with\\noccupational exposure to asbestos  (particularly crocidolite) for\\na number of years, usually 20 to 40 years (page 492). About90% of malignant mesotheliomas are asbestos-related.Mechanism of carcinogenicity by asbestos is not quite clearbut it appears that prolonged exposure of amphibole type ofasbestos is capable of inducing oncogenic mutation in themesothelium.  However, prolonged asbestos-exposure isconsidered more significant rather than heavy exposure asdocumented by occurrence of malignant mesothelioma in thefamily members of asbestos workers. Although combinationof cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure greatly increasesrisk to develop bronchogenic carcinoma, there is no suchextra increased risk of developing mesothelioma in asbestosworkers who smoke. Recently, SV40 (simian vacuolatingvirus) antigen has also been implicated in the etiology ofmesothelioma.\\nGrossly,  the tumour is characteristically diffuse, forming\\na thick, white, fleshy coating over the parietal and visceralsurfaces (Fig. 17.41) .Figure 17.41 Malignant (diffuse) mesothelioma, gross appearance.\\nThe tumour is seen to form a thick, white, fleshy coat over the parietal\\nand visceral surfaces.Microscopically,  malignant mesothelioma may have\\nepithelial, sarcomatoid or biphasic patterns.\\ni) Epithelial pattern  resembles an adenocarcinoma,\\nconsisting of tubular and tubulo-papillary formations. The\\ntumour cells are usually well-differentiated, cuboidal,flattened or columnar cells.\\nii) Sarcomatoid pattern  consists of spindle cell sarcoma\\nresembling fibrosarcoma. The tumour cells are arranged\\nin a storiform pattern with abundant collagen betweenthem.\\niii)Biphasic pattern  shows mixed growth having\\nepithelial as well as sarcomatoid pattern. Usually, there\\nare slit-like or gland-like spaces lined by neoplasticmesothelial cells separated by proliferating spindle-shaped tumour cells  (Fig. 17.42) .\\nAsbestos bodies  are found in the lungs of most patients\\nwith malignant mesothelioma of any histologic type.\\nClinical manifestations include chest pain, dyspnoea,\\npleural effusion and infections. The tumour spreads rapidlyby direct invasion into lung and by lymphatic spread intohilar lymph nodes and pericardium. Sometimes distantmetastases, particularly to the liver, occur. The prognosis ispoor; 50% of patients die within one year of diagnosis.\\nSECONDARY PLEURAL TUMOURS\\nMetastatic malignancies in the pleura are more common than\\nthe primary tumours and appear as small nodules scatteredover the lung surface. The most frequent primary malignanttumours metastasising to the pleura are of the lung and breastthrough lymphatics, and ovarian cancers via haematogenousroute.\\n❑Figure 17.42 Malignant mesothelioma, showing biphasic pattern\\nof growth.\\n507CHAPTER 18 The Eye, ENT and Neck\\nThe Eye, ENT and Neck Chapter 18Chapter 18\\nEYE\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe structure of the eye is shown diagrammatically in\\nFig. 18.1 . The eyelids  are covered externally by the skin and\\ninternally by conjunctiva which is reflected over the globe of\\nthe eye. The lacrimal glands  which are compound racemose\\nglands are situated at the outer upper angle of the orbit. Theglobe of the eye  is composed of 3 layers: the cornea-sclera,\\nchoroid-iris, and retina.\\nThe cornea  consists of stratified epithelium which may\\nbe regarded as continuation of the conjunctiva over thecornea. The subepithelial stroma consists of fibrousconnective tissue, and the posterior endothelium-lined thinelastic membrane called Descemet’s membrane.\\nThe sclera  is composed of dense fibrous tissue which is\\nthickest at the back of the eyeball.\\nThe choroid  is the vascular membrane in contact with\\nthe sclera. The choroid becomes thickened anteriorly forming\\nciliary body, ciliary processes and contains ciliary muscle.\\nThe iris is the continuation of the choroid which extends\\nin front of the lens. It is similar in structure to the choroid\\nbut contains pigment cells.\\nThe uveal tract  consists of 3 parts—the choroid and ciliary\\nbody posteriorly, and the iris anteriorly.\\nThe retina  is part of the central nervous system and\\ncorresponds in extent to the choroid which it lines internally.The retina is composed of a number of layers of cells andtheir synapses which are of 3 types—external photoreceptorcells (rods and cones), intermediate relay layer of bipolarcells, and internal layer of ganglion cells with their axonsrunning into the central nervous system. The central fovea  is\\na specially differentiated spot in the retina posteriorly whichconsists only of photosensitive cones but is devoid ofphotoreceptor rods and blood vessels. Macula lutea or yellow\\nspot surrounds the central fovea and though not as sensitive\\nas central fovea, it is more so than the other parts of the retina.At the optic disc, the fibres of the nerve fibre layer of theretina pass into the optic nerve.\\nThe lens  is the biconvex mass of laminated transparent\\ntissue with elastic capsule.\\nThe anterior chamber is the space filled with the aqueous\\nhumour, and is bounded by the cornea in front and the irisbehind, with anterior surface of the lens exposed in the pupil.\\nThe posterior chamber  containing aqueous humour is\\nthe triangular space between the back of the iris, the anteriorsurface of the lens and ciliary body forming its apex at thepupillary margin.The vitreous chamber  is the large space behind the lens\\ncontaining gelatinous material, the vitreous humour.\\nThe main  function of the eye is visual acuity which\\ndepends upon a transparent focussing system comprised bythe cornea, lens, transparent media consisting of aqueousand vitreous humours, and a normal retinal and neuralconduction system. The cornea and lens receive their nutrientdemands from the aqueous humour produced by the ciliaryprocesses. The intraocular pressure is normally 15-20 mmHgand depends upon the rate of aqueous production and onthe resistance in the outflow system.\\nCONGENITAL LESIONS\\nRETROLENTAL FIBROPLASIA (RETINOPATHY OF\\nPREMATURITY).  This is a developmental disorder occur-\\nring in premature infants who have been given oxygen-therapy at birth. The basic defect lies in the developmentalprematurity of the retinal blood vessels which are extremelysensitive to high dose of oxygen-therapy. The peripheralretina is incompletely vascularised in such infants andexposure to oxygen results in vaso-obliteration. On stoppageof oxygen-therapy, vasoproliferation begins leading toneovascularisation, cicatrisation and retinal detachment.\\nRETINITIS PIGMENTOSA.  Retinitis pigmentosa is a group\\nof systemic and ocular diseases of unknown etiology,\\ncharacterised by degeneration of the retinal pigmentepithelium. The condition can have various inheritancepatterns—autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive trait, orsex-linked recessive trait. The earliest clinical finding is nightblindness due to loss of rods and may progress to totalblindness.Figure 18.1 Schematic diagram of longitudinal section of the eyeball.\\n508SECTION III Systemic PathologyHistologically,  there is disappearance of rods and cones\\nof the photoreceptor layer of the retina, degeneration of\\nretinal pigment epithelium and ingrowth of glialmembrane on the optic disc.\\nINFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS\\nInflammatory conditions of the eye are designated according\\nto the tissue affected. ‘Uveitis’ is the commonly used termfor the ocular inflammation of the uveal tract which is themost vascular tissue of the eye. However, specific designationis used for the type of tissue of eye inflamed. Some of theimportant types are described below.\\nSTYE (HORDEOLUM).  Stye or ‘external hordeolum’ is an\\nacute suppurative inflammation of the sebaceous glands of\\nZeis, the apocrine glands of Moll and the eyelash follicles.The less common ‘internal hordeolum’ is an acutesuppurative inflammation of the meibomian glands.\\nCHALAZION.  Chalazion is a very common lesion and is\\nthe chronic inflammatory process involving the meibomian\\nglands. It occurs as a result of obstruction to the drainage ofsecretions. The inflammatory process begins with destructionof meibomian glands  and duct and subsequently involves\\ntarsal plate.\\nHistologically,  the chalazion gives the appearance of a\\nchronic inflammatory granuloma located in the tarsus andcontains fat globules in the centre of the granulomas i.e.appearance of a lipogranuloma (Fig. 18.2) .\\nENDOPHTHALMITIS.  Endophthalmitis is an acute\\nsuppurative intraocular inflammation which may be ofexogenous or endogenous origin. The exogenous agents maybe bacteria, viruses or fungi introduced into the eye duringan accidental or surgical perforating wound. The endogenousagents include opportunistic infections which may causeendophthalmitis via haematogenous route e.g. candidiasis,toxoplasmosis, nocardiosis, aspergillosis and cryptococcosis.\\nCONJUNCTIVITIS AND KERATOCONJUNCTIVITIS.\\nConjunctiva and cornea are constantly exposed to varioustypes of physical, chemical, microbial (bacteria, fungi,viruses) and allergic agents and hence prone to develop acute,subacute and chronic inflammations. In the acute stage, thereis corneal oedema and infiltration by inflammatory cells,affecting the transparency of the cornea. In the more chronicform of inflammation, there is proliferation of small bloodvessels in the normally avascular cornea and infiltration bylymphocytes and plasma cells (pannus formation).\\nTRACHOMA AND INCLUSION CONJUNCTIVITIS.\\nBoth these conditions are caused by Chlamydia  or TRIC\\nagents. Trachoma is caused by C. trachomatis  while inclusion\\nconjunctivitis is caused by C. oculogenitalis.  Trachoma is\\nwidely prevalent in the underdeveloped and developingcountries of the world and is responsible for blindness on alarge scale. In the early stage of infection, the trachoma agentthat infects the conjunctival epithelium, can be recognisedin the smears by the intracytoplasmic inclusion bodiesformed by the proliferating microorganisms within the cells.Later, the conjunctiva thickens due to dense chronicinflammatory cell infiltrate alongwith lymphoid follicles andmacrophages. The end-result is extensive corneal andconjunctival cicatrisation accounting for blindness intrachoma. Inclusion conjunctivitis, though caused by anorganism closely related to trachoma agent, is a much lesssevere disease and causes mild keratoconjunctivitis.\\nGRANULOMATOUS UVEITIS.  A number of chronic\\ngranulomatous conditions may cause granulomatous uveitis.\\nThese include bacteria (e.g. tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis),viruses (e.g. CMV disease, herpes zoster), fungi (e.g.aspergillosis, blastomycosis, phycomycosis, histoplasmosis),and certain parasites (e.g. toxoplasmosis, onchocerciasis).Granulomatous uveitis is common in sarcoidosis as well.\\nSYMPATHETIC OPHTHALMIA (SYMPATHETIC\\nUVEITIS).  This is an uncommon condition in which there is\\nbilateral diffuse granulomatous uveitis following penetratinginjury to one eye. The condition probably results from anautosensitivity reaction to injured uveal tissue. It leads to asevere visual loss in both the eyes if not diagnosed andtreated early.\\nHistologically,  there is granulomatous uveal inflamma-\\ntion consisting of epithelioid cells and lymphocytesaffecting both the eyes. There is no necrosis and noneutrophilic or plasma cell infiltration. If lens is alsoinjured, it results in phacoanaphylactic endophthalmitis.\\nVASCULAR LESIONS\\nDIABETIC RETINOPATHY.  Diabetic retinopathy is an\\nimportant cause of blindness. It is related to the degree and\\nduration of glycaemic control. The condition develops inmore than 60% of diabetics 15-20 years after the onset of\\nFigure 18.2 Chalazion of the eyelid. There is presence of a\\nlipogranuloma having central pool of fat and surrounded by mixed\\ninflammatory cells and foreign body type multinucleated giant cells.\\n509CHAPTER 18 The Eye, ENT and Neckdisease, and in about 2% of diabetics causes blindness. Other\\nocular complications of diabetes include glaucoma, cataractand corneal disease. Most cases of diabetic retinopathy occurover the age of 50 years. The risk is greater in type 1 diabetesmellitus than in type 2 diabetes mellitus, although in clinicalpractice there are more patients of diabetic retinopathy dueto type 2 diabetes mellitus because of its higher prevalence.Women are more prone to diabetes as well as diabeticretinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is directly correlated withKimmelstiel-Wilson nephropathy (page 678).\\nHistologically,  two types of changes are described in\\ndiabetic retinopathy—background (non-proliferative) andproliferative retinopathy.\\n1. Background (non-proliferative) retinopathy. This is\\nthe initial retinal capillary microangiopathy. The following\\nchanges are seen:\\ni) Basement membrane shows varying thickness due to\\nincreased synthesis of basement membrane substance.\\nii) Degeneration of pericytes and some loss of endothelial\\ncells are found.\\niii) Capillary microaneurysms appear which may develop\\nthrombi and get occluded.\\niv) ‘Waxy exudates’ accumulate in the vicinity of\\nmicroaneurysms especially in the elderly diabeticsbecause of hyperlipidaemia.\\nv) ‘Dot and blot haemorrhages’ in the deeper layers of\\nretina are produced due to diapedesis of erythrocytes.\\nvi) Soft ‘cotton-wool spots’ appear on the retina which\\nare microinfarcts of nerve fibre layers. ‘Scotomas’ appearfrom degeneration of nerve fibres and ganglion cells.\\n2. Proliferative retinopathy (retinitis proliferans). After\\nmany years, retinopathy becomes proliferative. Severeischaemia and chronic hypoxia for long period leads tosecretion of angiogenic factor by retinal cells and resultsin the following changes:\\ni) Neovascularisation of the retina at the optic disc.ii) Friability of newly-formed blood vessels causes them\\nto bleed easily and results in vitreous haemorrhages.\\niii) Proliferation of astrocytes and fibrous tissue around\\nthe new blood vessels.\\niv) Fibrovascular and gliotic tissue contracts to cause\\nretinal detachment and blindness.\\nIn addition to the changes on retina, severe diabetes\\nmay cause diabetic iridopathy with formation of adhesionsbetween iris and cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae)and between iris and lens (posterior synechiae). Diabeticsalso develop cataract of the lens at an earlier age than thegeneral population.\\nThe pathogenesis of blindness in diabetes mellitus is\\nschematically outlined in Fig. 18.3 .\\nHYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY.  In hypertensive\\nretinopathy, the retinal arterioles are reduced in theirdiameter leading to retinal ischaemia. In acute severe hyper-tension as happens at the onset of malignant hypertensionand in toxaemia of pregnancy, the vascular changes are inthe form of spasms, while in chronic hypertension thechanges are diffuse in the form of onion-skin thickening ofthe arteriolar walls with narrowing of the lumina (page 391).\\nFeatures of hypertensive retinopathy include the\\nfollowing (Fig. 18.4) :\\ni) Variable degree of arteriolar narrowing due to\\narteriolosclerosis.ii\\n) ‘Flame-shaped’ haemorrhages in the retinal nerve fibre\\nlayer.iii) Macular star i.e. exudates radiating from the centre ofmacula.iv) Cotton-wool spots i.e. fluffy white bodies in thesuperficial layer of retina.v) Microaneurysms.vi) Arteriovenous nicking i.e. kinking of veins at sites wheresclerotic arterioles cross veins.vii) Hard exudates due to leakage of lipid and fluid intomacula.Figure 18.3 Schematic diagram showing the effects of diabetes mellitus on eye in causing blindness.\\n510SECTION III Systemic PathologyHypertensive retinopathy is classified according to the\\nseverity of above lesions from grade I to IV. More serious\\nand severe changes with poor prognosis occur in highergrades of hypertensive retinopathy. Malignant hypertensionis characterised by necrotising arteriolitis and fibrinoidnecrosis of retinal arterioles.\\nRETINAL INFARCTS.  Infarcts of the retina may result from\\nthrombosis or embolism in central artery of the retina,\\ncausing ischaemic necrosis of the inner two-third of the retinawhile occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries causesischaemia of the inner photoreceptor layer only. The usualcauses of thrombosis and embolism are atherosclerosis,hypertension and diabetes. Occlusion of the central retinalvein produces haemorrhagic infarction of the entire retina.\\nMISCELLANEOUS CONDITIONS\\nPINGUECULA AND PTERYGIUM.  Pinguecula  is a\\ndegenerative condition of the collagen of the bulbar\\nconjunctiva. Clinically, the condition appears as raisedyellowish lesions on the interpalpebral bulbar conjunctivaof both eyes in middle-aged and elderly patients.\\nHistologically,  there is characteristic basophilic\\ndegeneration of the subepithelial collagen of theconjunctiva. The overlying epithelium may showacanthosis, hyperkeratosis or dyskeratosis.\\nPterygium is a lesion closely related to pinguecula but differsfrom the latter by being located at the limbus and ofteninvolves the cornea; hence the lesion is more importantclinically.\\nSENILE MACULAR DEGENERATION.  Age-related\\ndegeneration of the macular region of the retina is an\\nimportant cause of bilateral central visual loss in the elderlypeople.\\nHistologically,  in the early stage, there is irregular\\nthickening of the Bruch’s membrane that separates retinalpigment epithelium from the choroid, and there isdegeneration of the photoreceptor and pigmentepithelium. Later, there is ingrowth of capillaries into thechoroid, exudation and haemorrhage under the retinawhich may eventually get organised and heal by fibrosisand result in permanent loss of central vision.\\nRETINAL DETACHMENT.  Retinal detachment is the\\nseparation of the neurosensory retina from the retinalpigment epithelium. It may occur spontaneously in olderindividuals past 50 years of age, or may be secondary totrauma in the region of head and neck. Normally, the rodsand cones of the photoreceptor layer are interdigitated withprojections of the retinal pigment epithelium, but the twocan separate readily in some disease processes. There are 3pathogenetic mechanisms of retinal detachment:i)Pathologic processes in the vitreous or anterior segment,\\ncausing traction on the retina.ii)\\nCollection of serous fluid in the sub-retinal space from\\ninflammation or tumour in the choroid.iii) Accumulation of vitreous under the retina through a holeor a tear in the retina.\\nPHTHISIS BULBI. Phthisis bulbi is the end-stage of\\nadvanced degeneration and disorganisation of the entire\\neyeball in which the intraocular pressure is decreased andthe eyeball shrinks. The causes of such end-stage blind eyeare trauma, glaucoma and intraocular inflammations.\\nHistologically,  there is marked atrophy and disorga-\\nnisation of all the ocular structures, and markedlythickened sclera. Even osseous metaplasia may occur.\\nCATARACT.  The cataract is the opacification of the normally\\ncrystalline lens which leads to gradual painless blurring ofvision. The various causes of cataract are: senility, congenital(e.g. Down syndrome, rubella, galactosaemia), traumatic (e.g.penetrating injury, electrical injury), metabolic (e.g. diabetes,hypoparathyroidism), and associated with drugs (e.g. long-term corticosteroid therapy), smoking and heavy alcoholconsumption. The most common is, however, idiopathicsenile cataract.\\nHistologically,  the changes in the cataractous lens are\\nsimilar irrespective of the underlying cause. The lens fibresundergo degeneration, fragmentation and liquefaction butthe central nucleus remains intact because it is quitesclerotic.\\nGLAUCOMA.  Glaucoma is a group of ocular disorders that\\nhave in common increased intraocular pressure. Glaucomais one of the leading causes of blindness because of theocular tissue damage produced by raised intraocularpressure. In almost all cases, glaucoma occurs due toimpaired outflow of aqueous humour, though there is atheoretical possibility of increased production of aqueousby the ciliary body causing glaucoma. The obstruction tothe aqueous flow may occur as a result of developmentalmalformations ( congenital glaucoma ); or due to\\ncomplications of some other diseases such as uveitis,trauma, intraocular haemorrhage and tumours ( secondary\\nglaucoma ); or may be primary glaucoma  which is typically\\nbilateral and is the most common type.Figure 18.4 Ocular lesions in hypertension.\\n511CHAPTER 18 The Eye, ENT and NeckThere are 2 types of primary glaucoma— primary open-\\nangle  (chronic simple glaucoma) and primary angle-closure\\n(acute congestive glaucoma). Primary open-angle glaucoma\\nis more common type and is usually a genetically-determineddisease. Primary angle-closure glaucoma occurs due toshallow anterior chamber and hence narrow angle causing\\nblockage to aqueous outflow.\\nIn all types of glaucoma, degenerative changes appear\\nafter some duration and eventually damage to the optic nerve\\nand retina occurs.\\nPAPILLOEDEMA.  Papilloedema is oedema of the optic disc\\nresulting from increased intracranial pressure. This is due\\nto anatomic continuation of the subarachnoid space of thebrain around the optic nerve so that raised intracranial\\npressure is passed onto the optic disc area. In acute\\npapilloedema,  there is oedema, congestion and haemorrhage\\nat the optic disc. In chronic papilloedema,  there is degene-\\nration of nerve fibres, gliosis and optic atrophy.\\nSJÖGREN’S SYNDROME.  Sjögren’s syndrome is charac-\\nterised by triad of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, xerostomia (sicca\\nsyndrome) and rheumatoid arthritis. The condition occursdue to immunologically-mediated destruction of the lacrimal\\nand salivary glands along- with another autoimmune disease\\n(Chapter 4).\\nMIKULICZ’S SYNDROME.  This is characterised by\\ninflammatory enlargement of lacrimal and salivary glands\\n(Chapter 19). The condition may occur with Sjögren’ssyndrome, or with some diseases like sarcoidosis, leukaemia,lymphoma and macroglobulinaemia.\\nTUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nThe eye and its adnexal structures are the site of a variety of\\nbenign and malignant tumours as well as tumour-like lesions.A brief list of such lesions is given in Table 18.1.  The\\nmorphology of many of these tumours and tumour-likelesions is identical to similar lesions elsewhere in the body.However, a few examples peculiar to the eye are described\\nbelow.\\nInflammatory Pseudotumours\\nThese are a group of inflammatory enlargements, especially\\nin the orbit, which clinically look like tumours but surgicalexploration and pathologic examination fail to reveal any\\nevidence of neoplasm.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  these lesions are\\ncircumscribed and sometimes have fibrous capsule.\\nMicroscopically,  many of the lesions can be placed in well-\\nestablished categories such as tuberculous, syphilitic,\\nmycotic, parasitic, foreign-body granuloma etc, while\\nothers show non-specific histologic appearance havingabundant fibrous tissue, lymphoid follicles andinflammatory infiltrate with prominence of eosinophils.\\nSebaceous Carcinoma\\nThis is the most frequent tu mour  of the eyelid  next only to basal\\ncell carcinoma, although it is very rare tumour elsewhere in\\nthe body. It arises either from the meibomian glands in thetarsus or from Zeis’ glands of eyelash follicles. The tumouris seen more commonly in the upper eyelid (basal cellcarcinoma is seen more frequently in the lower eyelid).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour\\nappears as a localised or diffuse swelling of the tarsus, ormay be in the form of ulcerated or papillomatous tumourat the lid margin.Microscopically,  the tumour may show well-differen-\\ntiated lobules of tumour cells with sebaceous differen-tiation, or may be poorly-differentiated tumour requiringconfirmation by fat stains (Fig. 18.5) .

It is discussed in detail in Chapter 26.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the malignant\\nmelanoma appears as a pigmented mass, most commonlyin the posterior choroid, and less often in the ciliary bodyand iris. The mass projects into the vitreous cavity withretina covering it (Fig. 18.6) .\\nMicroscopically,  age-old classification of Callender (1931)\\nwhich has prognostic significance is still followed withsome modifications:\\n1. Spindle A melanoma  is composed of uniform,\\nspindle-shaped cells containing spindled nuclei. Nucleoli\\nare indistinct and mitotic figures are rare. Tumours of thistype have the most favourable prognosis (85% 10-yearsurvival).\\n2. Spindle B melanoma  is composed of larger and plump\\nspindle-shaped cells with ovoid nuclei. Nucleoli are\\nconspicuous and a few mitotic figures are present. Thesetumours carry slightly worse prognosis (80% 10-yearsurvival).\\n3.\\nEpithelioid melanoma  consists of larger, irregular and\\npleomorphic cells with larger nuclei and abundant\\nacidophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 18.7) . These tumours are the\\nmost malignant of the uveal melanomas and have poorprognosis (35% 10-year survival).\\n4.Mixed cell type melanomas  have features of spindle\\ncell type as well as of epithelioid cell type. These are more\\ncommon tumours and carry an intermediate prognosis(45% 10-year survival).\\nIn general, uveal malignant melanomas are usually slow-\\ngrowing, late metastasising and have a better prognosis thanmalignant melanoma of the skin (Chapter 26). Uvealmelanomas spread via haematogenous route and liver iseventually involved in 90% of cases. Various indicators ofbad prognosis include large tumour size and epithelioid celltype.\\nRetinoblastoma\\nThis is the most common malignant ocular tumour in\\nchildren. It may be present at birth or recognised in earlychildhood before the age of 4 years. Retinoblastoma has somepeculiar features. About 60% cases of retinoblastoma aresporadic and the remaining 40% are familial. Familialtumours are often multiple and multifocal and transmittedas an autosomal dominant trait by retinoblastomasusceptibility gene (RB) located on chromosome 13. Such\\nindividuals have a higher incidence of bilateral tumours andhave increased risk of developing second primary tumour,particularly osteogenic sarcoma. Retinoblastoma may occurFigure 18.7 Uveal melanoma. The tumour cells are epithelioid in\\nappearance having prominent nucleoli and contain black finely granular\\nmelanin pigment in the cytoplasm.Figure 18.6 Choroidal melanoma appearing as a pigmented mass\\npushing the retina forward over it.\\nFigure 18.8 Retinoblastoma, showing white mass growing\\nextensively within the posterior part of the eye.\\n513CHAPTER 18 The Eye, ENT and Neckas a congenital tumour too. Clinically, the child presents with\\nleukokoria i.e. white pupillary reflex.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour\\ncharacteristically appears as a white mass within the retinawhich may be partly solid and partly necrotic. The tumourmay be endophytic  when it protrudes into the vitreous, or\\nexophytic  when it grows between the retina and the\\npigment epithelium (Fig. 18.8) .\\nMicroscopically , the tumour is composed of\\nundifferentiated retinal cells with tendency towardsformation of photo-receptor elements. In the betterdifferentiated area, the tumour cells are characteristicallyarranged in rosettes. The rosettes may be of 2 types—Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes  characterised by small\\ntumour cells arranged around a lumen with their nucleiaway from the lumen, and Homer-Wright rosettes  having\\nradial arrangement of tumour cells around the centralneurofibrillar structure (Fig. 18.9) . The tumour shows\\nwide areas of necrosis and calcification and disseminationin all directions—into the vitreous, under the retina, intothe optic nerve and even into the brain.The tumour can spread widely via haematogenous route\\nas well. Prognosis is determined by the extent of localinvasion and distant metastasis.\\nSalient features of retinoblastoma are contrasted with\\nthose of uveal melanoma in Table 18.2.\\nMeta\\nstatic Tumours\\nOcular metastatic tumours are far more common thanprimary ocular malignant tumours, choroid and iris beingthe preferential site for metastasis. Common primarytumours that metastasise in the eye are cancers of the breastin women and lung in men. Leukaemia and malignantlymphoma also commonly invade ocular tissues.\\nEAR\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe ear is divided into 3 parts—the external, middle and\\ninner ear.\\nThe external ear  comprises the auricle or pinna composed\\nof cartilage, the external cartilaginous meatus and theexternal bony meatus. The external meatus is lined byFigure 18.9 Retinoblastoma. The tumour arising from the retina (arrow) shows undifferentiated retinal cells and the typical rosettes.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 18.2: Uveal Malignant Melanoma versus  Retinoblastoma.\\nFeature Melanoma Retinoblastoma\\n1.

The tympanic membrane\\nhas middle layer of elastic fibrous tissue and the inner layer\\nof mucous membrane and is supported around the peripheryby the annulus.\\nThe middle ear  consists of 3 parts—the uppermost\\nportion is the attic,  the middle portion is mesotympanum,  and\\nthe lowermost portion is the hypotympanum.  Besides, the\\nmiddle ear has an opening, eustachian tube, the mastoidantrum and cells, and the three ossicles (the malleus, incus\\nand stapes). The middle ear is lined by a single layer of flat\\nciliated and nonciliated epithelium.\\nThe inner ear  or labyrinth consists of bony capsule\\nembedded in the petrous bone and contains the membranous\\nlabyrinth. The bony capsule consists of 3 parts—posteriorly\\nthree semicircular canals, in the middle is the vestibule, andanteriorly contains snail-like cochlea.\\nBesides the function  of hearing, the stimulation of\\nvestibular labyrinth can cause vertigo, nausea, vomiting andnystagmus.\\nINFLAMMATORY LESIONS\\nOTITIS MEDIA.  This is the term used for inflammatory\\ninvolvement of the middle ear. It may be acute or chronic.\\nThe usual source of infection is via the eustachian tube andthe common causative organisms are Streptococcus\\npneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae  and β-Streptococcus\\nhaemolyticus.  Otitis media may be suppurative, serous or\\nmucoid. Acute suppurative otitis media (SOM) clinicallypresents as tense and hyperaemic tympanic membrane alongwith pain and tenderness and sometimes mastoiditis as well.\\nChronic SOM manifests clinically as draining ear with\\nperforated tympanic membrane and partially impairedhearing. Serous or mucoid otitis media refers to non-suppurative accumulation of serous or thick viscid fluid in\\nthe middle ear. These collections of fluid are encountered\\nmore often in children causing hearing problems and occurdue to obstruction of the eustachian tube.\\nRELAPSING POLYCHONDRITIS.  This is an uncommon\\nautoimmune disease characterised by complete loss of\\nglycosaminoglycans resulting in destruction of cartilage ofthe ear, nose, eustachian tube, larynx and lower respiratorytract.\\nHistologically,  the perichondral areas show acute\\ninflammatory cell infiltrate and destruction and vasculari-sation of the cartilage. Late stage shows lymphocyticinfiltration and fibrous replacement.\\nCHONDRODERMATITIS NODULARIS CHRONICAHELICIS.  This condition involves the external ear\\nsuperficially and presents as a ‘painful nodule of the ear’.The skin in this location is in direct contact with the cartilage\\nwithout protective subcutaneous layer.\\nHistologically,  the nodule shows epithelial hyperplasia\\nwith degeneration of the underlying collagen, chronicinflammatory cell  infiltrate, vascular proliferation and\\nfibrosis.\\nMISCELLANEOUS CONDITIONS\\nCAULIFLOWER EAR.  This is an acquired deformity of the\\nexternal ear due to degeneration of cartilage as a result of\\nrepeated trauma as occurs in boxers and wrestlers.\\nHistologically,  there is destruction of cartilage forming\\nhomogeneous matrix (chondromalacia) and fibrousreplacement.\\nOTOSCLEROSIS.  This is a dystrophic disease of labyrinth\\nof the temporal bone. The footplate of stapes first undergoesfibrous replacement and is subsequently replaced by scleroticbone. The exact etiology is not known but the condition hasfamilial preponderance and autosomal dominant trait. It isseen more commonly in young males as a cause for sensori-neural type of deafness.\\nTUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nTumours and tumour-like conditions are relatively more\\ncommon in the external than the middle and inner ear. Thelesions seen in the external ear are similar to those seen inthe skin e.g. tumour-like lesions  such as epidermal cyst; benign\\ntumours  like naevi and squamous cell papilloma; and\\nmalignant tumours  such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous\\ncell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. However, tumoursand tumour-like lesions which are specific to the ear aredescribed below. These include the following:\\nIn the external ear—aural (otic) polyps and cerumen-\\ngland tumours.\\nIn the middle ear—cholesteatoma (keratoma) and jugular\\nparaganglioma (glomus jugulare tumour).\\nIn the inner ear—acoustic neuroma.\\nAURAL (OTIC) POLYPS.  Aural or otic polyps are tumour-\\nlike lesions arising from the middle ear as a complication ofthe chronic otitis media and project into the external auditorycanal.\\nHistologically,  they are composed of chronic inflamma-\\ntory granulation tissue and are often covered bymetaplastic squamous epithelium or pseudostratifiedcolumnar epithelium.\\nCERUMEN-GLAND TUMOURS.  Tumours arising from\\ncerumen-secreting apocrine sweat glands of the externalauditory canal are cerumen-gland adenomas or cerumen-gland adenocarcinomas and are counter-parts of sweat glandtumours (hideradenoma and adenocarcinoma) of the skindiscussed in Chapter 26. Both these tumours may invade thetemporal bone.\\nCHOLESTEATOMA (KERATOMA).  This is a post-\\ninflammatory ‘pseudotumour’ found in the middle ear or\\nmastoid air cells. There is invariable history of acute orchronic otitis media. A marginal perforation is generally515CHAPTER 18 The Eye, ENT and Neckpresent through which the squamous epithelium enters the\\nmiddle ear and results in exfoliation of squamous andformation of the keratin. Rarely, it may be a primary lesionarising from embryonal rests of squamous epithelium in the\\ntemporal bone.\\nHistologically,  the lesion consists of cyst containing\\nabundant keratin material admixed with cholesterol\\ncrystals and large number of histiocytes  (Fig. 18.10) .  In\\nadvanced cases, there may be pressure erosion of the bone.\\nJUGULAR PARAGANGLIOMA (GLOMUS JUGULARE\\nTUMOUR, NON-CHROMAFFIN PARAGANGLIOMA).\\nTumours originating from parasympathetic ganglia arecalled ‘paraganglioma’ and are named according to thelocation of the tissue of origin. The one arising from glomus\\njugulare bodies of the middle ear (jugulotympanic bodies)\\nis called jugular paraganglioma or chemodectoma or non-chromaffin paraganglioma and is the most common benigntumour of the middle ear. Histologically similar tumours are\\nseen in the carotid bodies and vagus (Chapter 27).\\nMicroscopically,  the tumour cells containing neuro-\\nsecretory granules are arranged in typical organoid\\npattern or nests. The tumour may extend locally to involve\\nthe skull and brain but may rarely metastasise.\\nACOUSTIC NEUROMA (ACOUSTIC SCHWANNOMA).\\nThis is a tumour of Schwann cells of 8th cranial nerve(page 893). It is usually located in the internal auditory canaland cerebellopontine angle. It is a benign tumour similar to\\nother schwannomas but by virtue of its location and large\\nsize, may produce compression of the important\\nneighbouring tissues leading to deafness, tinnitus, paralysis\\nof 5th and 7th nerves, compression of the brainstem andhydrocephalus.NOSE AND PARANASAL SINUSES\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe external nose and the septum are composed of bone and\\ncartilage. On the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, there is asystem of 3 ridges on each side known as conchae orturbinates—the inferior, middle and superior. The nasalaccessory sinuses are air spaces in the bones of the skull andcommunicate with the nasal cavity. They are the frontal airsinus, maxillary air sinus and the anterior ethmoid air cells,comprising the anterior group,  while posterior ethmoidal cells\\nand sphenoidal sinus form the posterior group.  The anterior\\ngroup drains into the middle meatus while the posteriorgroup drains into the superior meatus and the spheno-ethmoidal recess. Nasal mucous membranes as well as thelining of the nasal sinus are lined by respiratory epithelium(pseudostratified columnar ciliated cells). Mucous and serousglands underlie the mucous membrane. Besides, the upperand middle turbinate processes and the upper third of theseptum are covered with olfactory mucous membrane.\\nThe main physiologic functions  of the nose are smell,\\nfiltration, humidification and warming of the air beingbreathed.\\nINFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS\\nACUTE RHINITIS (COMMON COLD).  Acute rhinitis or\\ncommon cold is the common inflammatory disorder of the\\nnasal cavities that may extend into the nasal sinuses. It beginswith rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction and sneezing. Initially,the nasal discharge is watery, but later it becomes thick andpurulent. The etiologic agents are generally adenoviruses thatevoke catarrhal discharge. Chilling of the body is acontributory factor. Secondary bacterial invasion is common.The nasal mucosa is oedematous, red and thickened.\\nMicroscopically,  there are numerous neutrophils,\\nlymphocytes, plasma cells and some eosinophils withabundant oedema.\\nALLERGIC RHINITIS (HAY FEVER).  Allergic rhinitis\\noccurs due to sensitivity to allergens such as pollens. It is anIgE-mediated immune response consisting of an early acuteresponse due to degranulation of mast cells, and a delayedprolonged response in which there is infiltration byleucocytes such as eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils andmacrophages accompanied with oedema.\\nSINUSITIS.  Acute sinusitis is generally a complication of\\nacute or allergic rhinitis and rarely secondary to dental sepsis.\\nThe ostia are occluded due to inflammation and oedema andthe sinuses are full.  ‘Mucocele’  is filling up of the sinus with\\nmucus while ‘empyema’  of the sinus occurs due to collection\\nof pus. Acute sinusitis may become chronic due to incompleteresolution of acute inflammation and from damage to themucous membrane. Sinusitis may rarely spread to produceosteomyelitis and intracranial infections.\\nNASAL POLYPS. Nasal polyps are common and are\\npedunculated grape-like masses of tissue. They are the end-Figure 18.10 Cholesteatoma middle ear. There is chronic\\ninflammatory granulation tissue and foreign body giant cells around the\\ncholesterol clefts and some pink keratinous material.\\n516SECTION III Systemic Pathologyresult of prolonged chronic inflammation causing poly-\\npoid thickening of the mucosa. They may be allergic  or inflam-\\nmatory.  They are frequently bilateral and the middle turbinate\\nis the common site. Antrochoanal polyps  originate from the\\nmucosa of the maxillary sinus and appear in the nasal cavity.Morphologically, nasal and antro-choanal polyps areidentical.\\nGrossly,  they are gelatinous masses with smooth and\\nshining surface.Microscopically,  they are composed of loose oedematous\\nconnective tissue containing some mucous glands andvarying number of inflammatory cells like lymphocytes,plasma cells and eosinophils. Allergic polyps have plentyof eosinophils and hyperplasia of mucous glands. Bothinflammatory and allergic polyps are covered byrespiratory epithelium which may show squamousmetaplasia (Fig. 18.11) . Nasal polyps may have\\nsuperimposed fungal infection.\\nRHINOSPORIDIOSIS.  Rhinosporidiosis is caused by a\\nfungus, Rhinosporidium seeberi. Typically it occurs in a nasal\\npolyp but may be found in other locations like nasopharynx,larynx and conjunctiva. The disease is common in India andSri Lanka and sporadic in other parts of the world.\\nMicroscopically,  besides the structure of inflammatory\\nor allergic polyp, large number of organisms of the sizeof erythrocytes with chitinous wall are seen in the thick-walled sporangia.  Each sporangium may contain a few\\nthousand spores. On rupture of a sporangium, the sporesare discharged into the submucosa or on to the surface ofthe mucosa. The intervening tissue consists of inflam-matory granulation tissue (plasma cells, lymphocytes,histiocytes, neutrophils) while the overlying epitheliumshows hyperplasia, focal thinning and occasionalulceration (Fig. 18.12) .\\nRHINOSCLEROMA.  This is a chronic destructive\\ninflammatory lesion of the nose and upper respiratoryairways caused by diplobacilli, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis.  The\\ncondition is endemic in parts of Africa, America, South Asiaand Eastern Europe. The condition begins as a common coldand progresses to atrophic stage, and then into the nodularstage characterised by small tumour-like submucosal masses.\\nHistologically,  there is extensive infiltration by foamy\\nhistiocytes containing the organisms (Mikulicz cells) andother chronic inflammatory cells like lymphocytes andplasma cells.\\nGRANULOMAS.  Many granulomatous inflammations may\\ninvolve the nose. These include: tuberculosis, leprosy,syphilis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, Wegener’sgranulomatosis and lethal midline granuloma.\\nFigure 18.11 Allergic polyp nose. The overlying mucosa is covered\\npartly by respiratory and partly by squamous metaplastic epithelium.\\nThe underlying stroma is oedematous and contains inflammatory cellswith prominence of eosinophils.\\nFigure 18.12 Rhinosporidiosis in a nasal polyp. The spores are present in sporangia as well as are intermingled in the inflammatory cell\\ninfiltrate.\\n517CHAPTER 18 The Eye, ENT and Neck1. Tuberculosis or lupus  of the nose is uncommon and\\noccurs secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and usually\\nproduces ulcerative lesions on the anterior part of the septumof the nose.\\n2. Leprosy  begins as a nodule that may ulcerate and\\nperforate the septum.\\n3. Syphilis  may involve the nose in congenital form causing\\ndestruction of the septum, or in acquired tertiary syphilis in\\nthe form of gummas perforating the septum. In either case,characteristic saddle-nose deformity occurs due to collapseof bridge of the nose.\\n4. Aspergillosis  may involve the paranasal sinuses where\\nthe septate hyphae grow to form a mass called aspergilloma.\\n5. Mucormycosis  is an opportunistic infection caused by\\nMucorales  which are non-septate hyphae and involve the\\nnerves and blood vessels.6. Wegener’s granulomatosis  is a form of necrotising\\nvasculitis with granuloma formation affecting the upper\\nrespiratory tract, lungs and kidneys. In 15-50% of cases, thecondition may evolve into malignant lymphoma.\\n7. Lethal midline granuloma or polymorphic reticulosis\\nis a rare and lethal lesion of the upper respiratory tract thatcauses extensive destruction of cartilage and necrosis oftissues and does not respond to antibiotic treatment. Besidesthe necrosis, lymphoid infiltrates of pleomorphic and atypicalcells admixed with small lymphocytes, plasma cells andmacrophages are seen. Currently, the condition is consideredto be a T cell lymphoma that may respond to chemotherapyand radiotherapy (page 380).\\nTUMOURS\\nThe tumours of nose, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are\\nuncommon. However, benign and malignant tumours ofepithelial as well as mesenchymal origin can occur.\\nBenign Tumours\\n1.CAPILLARY HAEMANGIOMA.  Capillary haeman-\\ngioma of the septum of nose is a common benign lesion.\\n If\\nthe surface is ulcerated and the lesion contains inflammatory\\ncell infiltrate, it resembles inflammatory granulation tissueand is called ‘haemangioma of granulation tissue type’  or\\n‘granuloma pyogenicum’.\\n2. SINONASAL PAPILLOMAS.  Papillomas may occur in\\nthe nasal vestibule, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. They\\nare mainly of 2 types—f ungiform papilloma  with exophytic\\ngrowth, and inverted papilloma  with everted growth, also\\ncalled Schneiderian pailloma. Each of these may be lined withvarious combinations of epithelia: respiratory, squamous andmucous type.\\nMalignant Tumours\\n1. OLFACTORY NEUROBLASTOMA OR ESTHESIO-\\nNEUROBLASTOMA.  It occurs over the olfactory mucosa\\nas a polypoid mass that may invade the paranasal sinusesor skull. It is a highly malignant small cell tumour of neuralcrest origin that may, at times, be indistinguishable fromother small cell malignancies like rhabdomyosarcoma,undifferentiated carcinoma, lymphoma or Ewing’s sarcoma.Rosettes are found in about 10% of tumours.\\n2. CARCINOMAS.  Majority of carcinomas of the nasal cavity\\nand paranasal sinuses are squamous cell carcinomas,\\ncommonly called sinonasal carcinomas . They are seen more\\ncommonly in the elderly with history of heavy smoking andsevere chronic sinusitis, in nickel refinery workers and inwood workers. The tumour extends locally to involve thesurrounding bone and soft tissues and also metastasiseswidely. Other types of malignancies found uncommonly inthis location are: adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma,mucoepidermoid carcinoma, small cell carcinoma,lymphoma and malignant melanoma.\\nPHARYNX\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe pharynx has 3 parts—the nasopharynx, oropharynx\\n(pharynx proper) and the laryngopharynx. The whole ofpharynx is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Thelymphoid tissue of the pharynx is comprised by the tonsilsand adenoids.\\nINFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS\\nLUDWIG’S ANGINA.  This is a severe, acute streptococcal\\ncellulitis involving the neck, tongue and back of the throat.\\nThe condition was more common in the pre-antibiotic era asa complication of compound fracture of the mandible andperiapical infection of the molars. The condition often provesfatal due to glottic oedema, asphyxia and severe toxaemia.\\nVINCENT’S ANGINA.  Vincent’s angina is a painful\\ncondition of the throat characterised by local ulceration of\\nthe tonsils, mouth and pharynx. The causative organism isVincent’s bacillus.  The condition may occur as an acute illness\\ninvolving the tissues diffusely, or as chronic form consistingof ulceration of the tonsils.\\nDIPHTHERIA.  Diphtheria is an acute communicable disease\\ncaused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae.  It usually occurs in\\nchildren and results in the formation of a yellowish-grey\\npseudomembrane  in the mucosa of nasopharynx, oropharynx,\\ntonsils, larynx and trachea.  C. diphtheriae  elaborates an\\nexotoxin that causes necrosis of the epithelium which isassociated with abundant fibrinopurulent exudate resultingin the formation of pseudomembrane. Absorption of theexotoxin in the blood may lead to more distant injuriouseffects such as myocardial necrosis, polyneuritis,parenchymal necrosis of the liver, kidney and adrenals. Theconstitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise,obstruction of the airways and dyspnoea are quite marked.The condition has to be distinguished from the membraneof streptococcal infection.\\nTONSILLITIS.  Tonsillitis caused by staphylococci or\\nstreptococci may be acute or chronic. Acute tonsillitis  is charac-\\nterised by enlargement, redness and inflammation. Acute\\ntonsillitis may progress to acute follicular tonsillitis in which518SECTION III Systemic Pathologycrypts are filled with debris and pus giving it follicular\\nappearance. Chronic tonsillitis  is caused by repeated attacks\\nof acute tonsillitis in which case the tonsils are small andfibrosed. Acute tonsillitis may pass on to tissues adjacent totonsils to form peritonsillar abscess or quinsy.\\nPERITONSILLAR ABSCESS (QUINSY).  Peritonsillar\\nabscess or quinsy occurs as a complication of acute tonsil-litis. The causative organisms are staphylococci orstreptococci which are associated with infection of the tonsils.The patient complains of acute pain in the throat, trismus,difficulty in speech and inability to swallow. The glandsbehind the angle of the mandible are enlarged and tender.Besides the surgical management of the abscess, the patientmust be advised  tonsillectomy because quinsy is frequentlyrecurrent.\\nRETROPHARYNGEAL ABSCESS.  Formation of abscess in\\nthe soft tissue between the posterior wall of the pharynx and\\nthe vertebral column is called retropharyngeal abscess. Itoccurs due to infection of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes.It is found in debilitated children. A chronic form of theabscess in the same location is seen in tuberculosis of thecervical spine (cold abscess).\\nTUMOURS\\nThere are 4 main tumours of note in the pharynx, one\\nbenign—nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, and threemalignant— nasopharyngeal carcinoma,  embryonalrhabdomyosarcoma and malignant lymphoma.\\nNASOPHARYNGEAL ANGIOFIBROMA.  This is a\\npeculiar tumour that occurs exclusively in adolescent males\\n(10-20 years of age) suggesting the role of testosteronehormone in its production. Though a benign tumour of thenasopharynx, it may grow into paranasal sinuses, cheek andorbit but does not metastasise.\\nMicroscopically,  the tumour is composed of 2 components\\nas the name suggests—numerous small endothelium-lined vascular spaces and the stromal cells which aremyofibroblasts (Fig. 18.13) . The androgen-dependence of\\nthe tumour is confirmed by demonstration byimmunostaining for androgen receptors in 75% cases.\\nNASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA.  Nasopharyngeal\\ncarcinoma is a common cancer in South-East Asia, especiallyprevalent in people of Chinese descent under 45 years of age.Genetic susceptibility and role of Epstein-Barr virus are consi-dered important factors in its etiology (page 225). In fact,EBV-genome is found virtually in all cases of nasopharyngealcarcinoma. The primary tumour is generally small andundetected, while the metastatic deposits in the cervicallymph nodes may be large.\\nMicroscopically,  nasopharyngeal carcinoma has\\n3 histologic variants:i)Non-keratinising squamous cell carcinoma\\nii) Keratinising squamous cell carcinoma\\niii)\\nUndifferentiated (transitional cell) carcinomaNon-keratinising and keratinising squamous cell\\ncarcinomas are identical in morphology to typical tumoursin other locations. The undifferentiated carcinoma, alsocalled as transitional cell carcinoma, is characterised bymasses and cords of cells which are polygonal to spindledand have large vesicular nuclei. A variant of undiffe-rentiated carcinoma is ‘lymphoepithelioma’  in which\\nundifferentiated carcinoma is infiltrated by abundant non-neoplastic mature lymphocytes  (Fig. 18.14) .Figure 18.13 Angiofibroma nose. There is admixture of thin-walled\\nblood vessels and spindled stroma. The blood vessels are variable-sized,\\nsome having incomplete muscle coat and there is absence of elastictissue.  The stroma has stellate fibroblasts and mast cells.\\nFigure 18.14\\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma, non-keratinising. The\\ntumour is composed of undifferentiated anaplastic cells arranged in nests.\\n519CHAPTER 18 The Eye, ENT and NeckThe prognosis is usually fatal. Undifferentiated\\ncarcinoma is radiosensitive.\\nEMBRYONAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMA.  Also termed as\\nbotyroid rhabdomyosarcoma, this is one of the common\\nmalignant tumours in children but can also occur in adults.The lesion is highly cellular and mitotically active. Otherlocations include vagina, orbit, middle ear, oral cavity,retroperitoneum and bile duct. It is discussed in detail onpage 867.\\nMALIGNANT LYMPHOMA.  The lymphoid tissue of the\\nnasopharynx and tonsils may be the site for development of\\nmalignant lymphomas which resemble similar tumourselsewhere in the body.\\nLARYNX\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe larynx is composed of cartilages which are bound\\ntogether by ligaments and muscles and is covered by mucousmembrane. The cartilages of the larynx are of 2 types—unpaired and paired.\\nThe unpaired laryngeal cartilages  are epiglottis, thyroid\\ncartilage (Adam’s apple) and cricoid cartilage.\\nThe paired cartilages  are the arytenoid cartilages which\\nplay important part in the movement of vocal cords.\\nThe larynx as well as trachea are lined by respiratory\\nepithelium, except over the true vocal cords and theepiglottis, which are lined by stratified squamous epithelium.\\nINFLAMMAT O\\nRY CONDITIONS\\nACUTE LARYNGITIS.  This may occur as a part of the\\nupper or lower respiratory tract infection. Atmospheric\\npollutants like cigarette smoke, exhaust fumes, industrialand domestic smoke etc predispose the larynx to acutebacterial and viral infections. Streptococci  and H. influenzae\\ncause acute epiglottitis which may be life-threatening. Acutelaryngitis may occur in some other illnesses like typhoid,measles and influenza. Acute pseudomembranous(diphtheric) laryngitis occurs due to infection with C.\\ndiphtheriae.\\nCHRONIC LARYNGITIS.  Chronic laryngitis may occur\\nfrom repeated attacks of acute inflammation, excessive\\nsmoking, chronic alcoholism or vocal abuse. The surface isgranular due to swollen mucous glands. There may beextensive squamous metaplasia due to heavy smoking,chronic bronchitis and atmospheric pollution.\\nTUBERCULOUS LARYNGITIS.  Tuberculous laryngitis\\noccurs secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. Typical\\ncaseating tubercles are present on the surface of the larynx.\\nACUTE OEDEMA OF THE LARYNX.  This hazardous\\ncondition is an acute inflammatory condition, causing\\nswelling of the larynx that may lead to airway obstructionand death by suffocation. Acute laryngeal oedema may occurdue to trauma, inhalation of irritants, drinking hot fluids ormay be infective in origin.TUMOURS\\nBoth benign and malignant tumours occur in the larynx. The\\ncommon examples of benign tumours are papillomas andpolyps, while laryngeal carcinoma is an important exampleamongst malignant tumours.\\nLARYNGEAL PAPILLOMA AND PAPILLOMATOSIS.\\nJuvenile laryngeal papillomas are found in children oradolescents and are often multiple, while the adults haveusually a single lesion. Multiple juvenile papillomas mayundergo spontaneous regression at puberty. Humanpapilloma virus (HPV type 11 and 6) has been implicated inthe etiology of papillomas of the larynx.\\nGrossly,  the lesions appear as warty growths on the true\\nvocal cords, epiglottis and sometimes extend to the tracheaand bronchi.Microscopically,  papillomas are composed of finger-like\\npapillae, each papilla contains fibrovascular core coveredby stratified squamous epithelium (Fig. 18.15) .\\nLARYNGEAL NODULES.  Laryngeal nodules or polyps are\\nseen mainly in adults and are found more often in heavysmokers and in individuals subjected to vocal abuse.Therefore, they are known by various synonyms like singers’nodes, preachers’ node, and screamers’ nodes. The patientshave characteristic progressive hoarseness.\\nGrossly,  it is a small lesion, less than 1 cm in diameter,\\nrounded, smooth, usually sessile and polypoid swelling\\non the true vocal cords.\\nMicroscopically,  the nodules have prominent oedema\\nwith sparse fibrous tissue and numerous irregular and\\nFigure 18.15 Squamous cell papilloma. There is papillomatosis;\\npapillae are covered with well oriented and orderly layers of squamous\\ncells.\\n520SECTION III Systemic Pathologydilated vascular channels. Sometimes, the subepithelial\\nbasement membrane is thickened, resembling amyloidmaterial (Fig. 18.16) .\\nLARYNGEAL CARCINOMA.  Cancer of the larynx in 99%\\nof cases is squamous cell carcinoma. Rarely, adenocarcinomaand sarcoma are encountered. Squamous carcinoma of thelarynx occurs in males beyond 4th decade of life. Importantetiologic factor is heavy smoking of cigarettes, cigar or pipe;other factors include excessive alcohol consumption,radiation and asbestos exposure. Carcinoma of the larynx isconventionally classified into extrinsic  that arises or extends\\noutside the larynx, and intrinsic  that arises within the larynx.\\nHowever, based on the anatomic location, laryngealcarcinoma is classified as under:1.Glottic  is the most common location, found in the region\\nof true vocal cords and anterior and posterior commissures.2.Supraglottic  involving ventricles and arytenoids.\\n3.Subglottic  in the walls of subglottis.\\n4.Marginal zone  between the tip of epiglottis and ary-\\nepiglottic folds.5.Laryngo-(hypo-) pharynx  in the pyriform fossa, postcricoid\\nfossa and posterior pharyngeal wall.\\nGrossly,  the glottic carcinoma is the most common form\\nand appears as a small, pearly white, plaque-likethickening that may be ulcerated or fungated.Microscopically,  keratinising and non-keratinising\\nsquamous carcinomas of varying grades are found.Generally, carcinoma of the supraglottic and subglotticregions tends to be more poorly-differentiated than theglottic tumour. Besides the keratinising and non-keratinising squamous carcinoma, 2 special varieties ofsquamous carcinoma in the larynx are: verrucous carcinoma\\n(or Ackerman’s tumour) which is a variant of well-differentiated squamous carcinoma, and spindle cell\\ncarcinoma  which has elongated tumour cells resemblingsarcoma (pseudosarcoma) at the other extreme ofprognosis.\\nCervical lymph node metastasis of laryngeal carcinoma\\nare found in a good proportion of cases at the time ofdiagnosis. Death from laryngeal cancer occurs due to localextension of growth into vital structures like trachea andcarotid artery; other causes are bacterial infection, aspirationpneumonia, debility and disseminated metastases.\\nNECK\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe neck is the region from where important structures like\\noesophagus, trachea, carotid arteries, great veins and nervetrunks pass down. Besides, the neck has structures such ascarotid body, sympathetic ganglia, larynx, thyroid,parathyroids and lymph nodes. Only the tumours and cystsof the neck are considered here while the lesions pertainingto other anatomic structures are described elsewhere in thetextbook.\\nCYSTS OF NECK\\nThe cysts of neck may be medial (midline) or lateral\\n(Table 18.3).\\nMedial (Midline) Cervical Cyst s\\nTHYROGLOSSAL CYST.  Thyroglossal cyst arises from the\\nvestiges of thyroglossal duct that connects the foramen\\ncaecum at the base of the tongue with the normally locatedthyroid gland. The cyst is located in the midline, generallyat the level of hyoid bone, and rarely at the base of the tongue.\\nMicroscopically,  the cyst is lined by respiratory and/or\\nstratified squamous epithelium.\\nMIDLINE DERMOID CYST.  Dermoid cyst located in the\\nmidline of the neck occurs due to sequestration of dermalcells along the lines of closure of embryonic clefts. The cystcontains paste-like pultaceous material.\\nMicroscopically,  it is lined by epidermis and may contain\\nskin adnexal structures.\\nLateral Cervical Cysts\\nBRANCHIAL (LYMPHOEPITHELIAL) CYST.  Branchial or\\nlymphoepithelial cyst arises from incomplete closure of 2ndFigure 18.16 Laryngeal nodule. The lesion has intact surface\\nepithelium. The subepithelium has fibromyxoid appearance and contains\\nproliferating blood vessels some of which are hyalinised.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 18.3: Cysts of the Neck.\\nI. MEDIAL (MIDLINE) CYSTS\\n1.

Cystic hygroma\\n521CHAPTER 18 The Eye, ENT and Neckor 3rd branchial clefts. The cyst is generally located anterior\\nto the sternocleidomastoid muscle near the angle of themandible. The cyst is 1-3 cm in diameter and is filled withserous or mucoid material.\\nMicroscopically,  the cyst is lined by stratified squamous\\nor respiratory epithelium, covering subepitheliallymphoid tissue aggregates or follicles with germinalcentres.\\nPARATHYROID CYST.  Parathyroid cyst is a lateral cyst of\\nthe neck usually located deep to the sternocleidomastoidmuscle at the angle of the mandible. These may bemicroscopic cysts or larger. They are generally thin-walled,filled with clear watery fluid.\\nMicroscopically,  parathyroid cyst is lined by flattened\\ncuboidal to low columnar epithelium and the cyst wallmay contain any type of parathyroid cells.\\nCERVICAL THYMIC CYST.  Cervical thymic cyst originates\\nfrom cystic degeneration of Hassall’s corpuscles. It isgenerally located in the left lateral side of the neck.\\nMicroscopically,  the cyst is lined by stratified squamous\\nepithelium and the cyst wall may contain thymicstructures.\\nCYSTIC HYGROMA.  Cystic hygroma is a lateral swelling\\nat the root of the neck, usually located behind thesternocleidomastoid muscle. It may be present congenitallyor may manifest in the first 2 years of life. It is usuallymultilocular and may extend into the mediastinum andpectoral region.\\nMicroscopically,  cystic hygroma is a diffuse lymphan-\\ngioma containing large cavernous spaces lined byendothelium and containing lymph fluid (page 412).\\nTUMOURS\\nTumours of the neck may be primary or metastatic in cervical\\nlymph nodes.\\nPrimary Tumours\\nA few important examples of primary tumours in the neck\\nare carotid body tumour, torticollis and malignantlymphomas.\\nCAROTID BODY TUMOUR (CHEMODECTOMA,\\nCAROTID BODY PARAGANGLIOMA).  Carotid body\\ntumour arises in the carotid bodies which are situated at thebifurcation of the common carotid arteries. Carotid bodiesare normally part of the chemoreceptor system and the cellsof this system are sensitive to changes in the pH and arterialoxygen tension and are also the storage site for catechola-mines. Histologically similar tumours are found in otherparasympathetic ganglia represented by the vagus andglomus jugulare (jugulotympanic bodies, Chapter 27).Carotid body paragangliomas, as they are currently called,are rare tumours and occur between 3rd and 6th decades oflife with slight female preponderance. A few (5%) are bilateraland some show familial incidence.\\nGrossly,  they are small, firm, dark tan, encapsulated\\nnodules.\\nMicroscopically,  well-differentiated tumour cells form\\ncharacteristic organoid or alveolar pattern, as is the case\\nwith all other neuroendocrine tumours. The tumour cellscontain dark neurosecretory granules containingcatecholamines.\\nThese tumours are mostly benign but recurrences are\\nfrequent; about 10% may metastasise widely.\\nTORTICOLLIS (FIBROMATOSIS COLLI, WRY NECK).\\nThis is a deformity in which the head is bent to one side whilethe chin points to the other side. The deformity may occur ascongenital torticollis or may be an acquired form. The acquired\\nform  may occur secondary to fracture dislocation of the\\ncervical spine, Pott’s disease of the cervical spine, scoliosis,spasm of the muscles of neck, exposure to chill causingmyositis, and contracture following burns or wound healing.The congenital or primary torticollis  appears at birth or within\\nthe first few weeks of life as a firm swelling in the lowerthird of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The etiology isunknown but about half the cases are associated with breechdelivery.\\nGrossly,  the muscle is contracted, shortened and fibrous.\\nMicroscopically,  abundant dense fibrous tissue separates\\nthe muscle fibres.\\nMALIGNANT LYMPHOMAS.  Various forms of non-\\nHodgkin’s lymphomas and Hodgkin’s disease occur in thecervical lymph nodes which are described in Chapter 14.\\nSecondary Tumours\\nCervical lymph nodes are common site for metastases of a\\nlarge number of carcinomas. These include: squamous cellcarcinoma of the lips, mouth, tongue, larynx and oesophagus;transitional cell carcinoma of the pharynx and nasopharynx;thoracic and abdominal cancers such as of the stomach, lungs,ovaries, uterus and testis.\\n❑522SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nThe Oral Cavity and\\nSalivary GlandsChapter 19Chapter 19\\nORAL SOFT TISSUES\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe oral cavity is the point of entry for digestive and\\nrespiratory tracts. The mucous membrane of the mouthconsists of squamous epithelium covering vascularisedconnective tissue. The epithelium is keratinised over the hardpalate, lips and gingiva, while elsewhere it is non-keratinised.Mucous glands (minor salivary glands) are scatteredthroughout the oral mucosa. Sebaceous glands are presentin the region of the lips and the buccal mucosa only.Lymphoid tissue is present in the form of tonsils andadenoids.\\nThe oral cavity is the site of numerous congenital and\\nacquired diseases. Besides, many systemic diseases have oralmanifestations. Some of the commonly occurring conditionsare discussed here.\\nDEVELOPMENTAL ANOMALIES\\n1.FACIAL CLEFTS.  Cleft upper lip (harelip) and cleft palate,\\nalone or in combination, are the commonest developmental\\nanomalies of the face. These occur from the failure of fusionof facial processes.\\n2.\\nFORDYCE’S GRANULES.  Fordyce’s granules are\\nsymmetric, small, light yellow macular spots on the lips and\\nbuccal mucosa and represent collections of sebaceous glands.They remain undeveloped until puberty but occur quitecommonly in adults.\\n3. LEUKOEDEMA.  This is an asymptomatic condition\\noccurring in children and is characterised by symmetric, grey-\\nwhite areas on the buccal mucosa. Histologically, there is\\npronounced intracellular oedema. There is no increasedmalignant potential compared to leukoplakia discussedbelow.\\n4. DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS OF THE TONGUE.\\nThese are as under:\\ni)Macroglossia  is the enlargement of the tongue, usually\\ndue to lymphangioma or haemangioma, and sometimes due\\nto amyloid tumour.\\ni\\ni) Microglossia and aglossia  are rare congenital anomalies\\nrepresenting small-sized and absence of tongue respectively.iii)Fissured tongue (scrotal, furrowed or grooved tongue)\\nis a genetically-determined condition characterised by\\nnumerous small furrows or grooves on the dorsum of thetongue. It is often associated with mild glossitis.iv) Bifid tongue  is a rare condition occurring due to failure\\nof the two lateral halves of the tongue to fuse in the midline.\\nv) Tongue tie  occurs when the lingual fraenum is quite\\nshort, or when the fraenum is attached near the tongue tip.vi) Hairy tongue  is not a true developmental defect, but is\\nmentioned here because of its similarity  with other\\nconditions discussed here. The filiform papillae arehypertrophied and elongated. These ‘hairs’ (papillae) arestained black, brown or yellowish-white by food, tobacco,oxidising agents or by oral flora.\\nMUCOCUTANEOUS LESIONS\\nLesions of the oral mucosa occur in many diseases of the\\nskin (Chapter 26) and they are similar in morphology. Someof these are listed as under:\\nLICHEN PLANUS.  Characteristically, oral lichen planus\\nappears as interlacing network of whitening or keratosis on\\nthe buccal mucosa but other oral tissues such as gingival,tongue and palate may also be involved.\\nVESICULAR LESIONS.  A number of vesicular or bullous\\ndiseases of the skin have oral lesions.\\ni)Pemphigus vulgaris.  Vesicular oral lesions appear\\ninvariably in all cases at some time in the course of\\npemphigus vulgaris. In about half the cases oral lesions arethe initial manifestations.\\ni\\ni) Pemphigoid.  Vesicles or bullae appear on oral mucosa\\nas well as on conjunctiva in pemphigoid and are seen more\\noften in older women.\\niii)Erythema multiforme.  Subepithelial vesicles may occur\\non the skin as well as mucosae.iv) Stevens-Johnson syndrome  is a rather fatal and severe\\nform of erythema multiforme involving oral and other\\nmucous membranes occurring following ingestion of sulfadrugs.\\nv) Epidermolysis bullosa  is a hereditary condition having\\nsubepidermal bullae on the skin as well as has oral lesions.\\nINFLAMMATORY DISEASES\\nSTOMATITIS.  Inflammation of the mucous membrane of\\nthe mouth is called stomatitis. It can occur in the course of\\nseveral different diseases.\\ni)Aphthous ulcers (Canker sores)  is the commonest form\\nof oral ulceration. The etiology is unknown but may be\\nprecipitated by emotional factors, stress, allergy, hormonalimbalance, nutritional deficiencies, gastrointestinal523CHAPTER 19 The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glandsdisturbances, trauma etc. The condition is characterised by\\npainful oral ulcers, 1 cm or more in size. Recurrent aphthae\\nmay form a part of Behcet’s syndrome and inflammatorybowel disease.\\nii) Herpetic  stomatitis  is an acute disease occurring in\\ninfants and young children. It is the most common\\nmanifestation of primary infection with herpes simplex virus.The lesions are in the form of vesicles around the lips. Similarlesions may appear on the genital skin. Recurrent attacksoccur due to stress, emotional upsets and upper respiratoryinfections.\\niii)Necrotising stomatitis (Noma or Cancrum oris)  occurs\\nmore commonly in poorly-nourished children like in\\nkwashiorkor; infectious diseases such as measles, immuno-deficiencies and emotional stress. The lesions arecharacterised by necrosis of the marginal gingiva and mayextend on to oral mucosa, causing cellulitis of the tissue ofthe cheek. The condition may progress to gangrene of thecheek.\\niv) Mycotic infections  commonly involving the oral mucosa\\nare actinomycosis and candidiasis.\\nCervicofacial actinomycosis  is the commonest form of the\\ndisease developing at the angle of the mandible (Chapter 6).\\nCandidiasis (moniliasis or thrush)  is caused by Candida\\nalbicans  which is a commensal in the mouth. It appears as an\\nopportunistic infection in immunocompromised host. There\\nare erythematous lesions on the palate and angular cheilitis.\\nGLOSSITIS.  Acute glossitis  characterised by swollen\\npapillae occurs in eruptions of measles and scarlet fever. In\\nchronic glossitis,  the tongue is raw and red without swollen\\npapillae and is seen in malnutrition such as in pellagra,ariboflavinosis and niacin deficiency. In iron deficiencyanaemia, pernicious anaemia and sprue, there is chronic\\natrophic glossitis characterised by atrophied papillae and\\nsmooth raw tongue.\\nSYPHILITIC  LESIONS.  Oral lesions may occur in primary,\\nsecondary, tertiary and congenital syphilis (Chapter 6).\\ni)Extragenital chancre of primary syphilis occurs most\\ncommonly on the lips.\\nii)Secondary syphilis  shows maculopapular eruptions and\\nmucous patches in the mouth.iii)In the tertiary syphilis,  gummas or diffuse fibrosis may be\\nseen on the hard palate and tongue.\\niv)Oral lesions of the congenital syphilis  are fissures at the\\nangles of mouth and characteristic peg-shaped notched\\nHutchinson’s incisors.\\nTUBERCULOUS LESIONS.  Involvement of the mouth in\\ntuberculosis is rare. The lesions are in the form of ulcers or\\nelevated nodules.\\nHIV INFECTION.  HIV infection of low grade as well as full-\\nblown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are\\nassociated with oral manifestations such as opportunisticinfections, malignancy, hairy leukoplakia and others; theseare listed in Table 19.1.  About half the cases of Kaposi’s\\nsarcoma have intraoral lesions as part of systemicinvolvement (Chapter 6).PIGMENTARY LESIONS\\nOral and labial melanotic pigmentation may be observed in\\ncertain systemic and metabolic disorders such as Addison’sdisease, Albright syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome andhaemochromatosis. All types of pigmented naevi as well asmalignant melanoma can occur in oral cavity. Exogenouspigmentation such as due to deposition of lead sulfide canalso occur.\\nTUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nBenign and malignant tumours as also a number of tumour-like lesions and premalignant lesions are encountered in theoral soft tissues. A list of such lesions is presented inTable 19.2.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 19.1: Oral Manifestations of AIDS.\\nA.

Other malignant tumours524SECTION III Systemic PathologyA. TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nA number of proliferative lesions arising from the oral tissues\\nare tumour-like masses which clinically may resembleneoplasms. Some of these are as under:\\nFIBROUS GROWTHS.  Fibrous growths of the oral soft\\ntissues are very common. These are not true tumours (unlike\\nintraoral fibroma and papilloma), but are insteadinflammatory or irritative in origin. A few common varietiesare as under:\\ni) Fibroepithelial polyps  occur due to irritation or chronic\\ntrauma. These are composed of reparative fibrous tissue,\\ncovered by a thin layer of stratified squamous epithelium.\\ni\\ni) Fibrous epulis  is a lesion occurring on the gingiva and is\\nlocalised hyperplasia of the connective tissue following\\ntrauma or inflammation in the area (Fig. 19.1) .  Giant cell epulis\\nis a variant seen more commonly in females as reactivechange to trauma; the lesion shows numerous osteoclast-likegiant cells and vascular stroma.\\niii)Denture hyperplasia  occurs in edentulous or partly\\nedentulous patients. The lesion is an inflammatory\\nhyperplasia in response to local irritation by ill-fitting dentureor an elongated tooth.\\nPYOGENIC GRANULOMA.  This is an elevated, bright red\\nswelling of variable size occurring on the lips, tongue, buccal\\nmucosa and gingiva. It is a vasoproliferative inflammatorylesion. Pregnancy tumour  is a variant of pyogenic granuloma.\\nMUCOCELE.  Also called mucous cyst or retention cyst, it is\\na cystic dilatation of the mucous glands of the oral mucosa.The cyst often ruptures on distension and incites inflam-matory reaction due to mucous extravasation (Fig. 19.2) .\\nRANULA.  It is a large mucocele located on the floor of the\\nmouth. The cyst is lined by true epithelial lining.\\nDERMOID CYST.  This tumour-like mass in the floor of the\\nmouth represents a developmental malformation. The cystis lined by stratified squamous epithelium. The cyst wall\\ncontains sebaceous glands, sweat glands, hair follicles andother mature tissues.\\nB. BENIGN TUMOURS\\nDifferent parts of the mouth have a variety of mesodermal\\ntissues and keratinising and non-keratinising epithelium.Therefore, majority of neoplasms arising from the oral tissuesare just like their counterparts in other parts of the body.Some of the common benign tumours of the mouth are asunder:\\nSQUAMOUS PAPILLOMA.  Papilloma can occur anywhere\\nin the mouth and has the usual papillary or finger-like\\nprojections.\\nMicroscopically,  each papilla is composed of vascularised\\nconnective tissue covered by squamous epithelium.\\nHAEMANGIOMA.  Haemangioma can occur anywhere in\\nthe mouth; when it occurs on the tongue it may causemacroglossia. It is most commonly capillary type, althoughcavernous and mixed types may also occur.\\nLYMPHANGIOMA.  Lymphangioma may develop most\\ncommonly on the tongue producing macroglossia; on the lips\\nproducing macrocheilia, and on the cheek. Cystic hygroma\\nis a special variety of lymphangioma occurring in children\\non the lateral side of neck.\\nMicroscopically,  lymphangioma is characterised by large\\nlymphatic spaces lined by endothelium and containinglymph (Chapter 15).\\nFIBROMA.  Although most common benign oral mucous\\nmembrane mass is fibroma appearing as a discrete superficialpedunculated mass, it appears to be nonneoplastic in nature.It probably arises as a response physical trauma (discussedabove).\\nFigure 19.1 Fibrous epulis in gingival.\\nFigure 19.2 Mucous retention cyst (mucocele). There is inflamma-\\ntory reaction around extravasated mucus.\\n525CHAPTER 19 The Oral Cavity and Salivary GlandsMicroscopically, fibroma is composed of collagenic\\nfibrous connective tissue covered by stratified squamousepithelium.\\nFIBROMATOSIS GINGIVAE.  This is a fibrous overgrowth\\nof unknown etiology involving the entire gingiva. Sometimesthe fibrous overgrowth is so much that the teeth are coveredby fibrous tissue.\\nTUMOURS OF MINOR SALIVARY GLANDS.  Minor\\nsalivary glands present in the oral cavity may sometimes be\\nthe site of origin of salivary tumours similar to those seen inthe major salivary glands (page 533). Pleomorphic adenomais a common example.\\nGRANULAR CELL TUMOUR.  Earlier called as granular cell\\nmyoblastoma, it is benign tumour which now by electron\\nmicroscopic studies is known to be mesenchymal in originthan odontogenic. The most common location is the tonguebut may occur in any other location on the oral cavity. Itoccurs exclusively in females. A similar lesion seen in infantsis termed as congenital epulis.\\nMicroscopically,  the tumour is composed of large\\npolyhedral cells with granular, acidophilic cytoplasm. Thecovering epithelium usually shows pronouncedpseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia.\\nOTHER RARE BENIGN TUMOURS.  Some other rare\\nbenign tumours which can occur in the oral soft tissues are:neurilemmoma, neurofibroma, lipoma, giant cell granuloma,\\nrhabdomyoma, leiomyoma, solitary plasmacytoma, osteoma,\\nchondroma, naevi and vascular oral lesions seen in hereditaryhaemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome)and encephalofacial angiomatosis (Sturge-Weber syndrome).\\nC. ORAL LEUKOPLAKIA (WHITE LESIONS)\\nDEFINITION.  Leukoplakia (white plaque)  may be clinically\\ndefined as a white patch or plaque on the oral mucosa,\\nexceeding 5 mm in diameter, which cannot be rubbed offnor can be classified into any other diagnosable disease. Anumber of other lesions are characterised by the formationof white patches listed in Table 19.3.  However, from the\\npathologist’s point of view, the term ‘leukoplakia’ is reservedfor epithelial thickening which may range from completelybenign to atypical and to premalignant cellular changes.INCIDENCE.  It occurs more frequently in males than\\nfemales. Th e lesions may be of variable size and appearance.\\nThe sites of predilection, in descending order of frequency,\\nare: cheek mucosa, angles of mouth, alveolar mucosa, tongue,\\nlip, hard and soft palate, and floor of the mouth. In about 4-\\n6% cases of leukoplakia, carcinomatous change is reported.\\nHowever, it is difficult to decide which white lesions may\\nundergo malignant transformation, but speckled or nodular\\nform is more likely to progress to malignancy. Therefore, it\\nis desirable that all oral white patches be biopsied to exclude\\nmalignancy.\\nETIOLOGY.  The etiological factors are similar to those\\nsuggested for carcinoma of the oral mucosa (discussed\\nbelow). It has the strongest association with the use of tobacco in\\nvarious forms , e.g. in heavy smokers (especially in pipe and\\ncigar smokers) and improves when smoking is discontinued,\\nand in those who chew tobacco as in paan, paan masaala,\\nzarda, gutka etc. The condition is also known by other names\\nsuch as smokers keratosis  and stomatitis nicotina.  Other\\netiological factors implicated are chronic friction such as withill-fitting dentures or jagged teeth, and local irritants like\\nexcessive consumption of alcohol and very hot and spicy\\nfoods and beverages. A special variety of leukoplakia called\\n‘hairy leukoplakia’  has been described in patients of AIDS and\\nhas hairy or corrugated surface but is not related todevelopment of oral cancer.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the lesions of\\nleukoplakia may appear white, whitish-yellow, or red-\\nvelvety of more than 5 mm diameter and variable in\\nappearance. They are usually circumscribed, slightly\\nelevated, smooth or wrinkled, speckled or nodular.\\nHistologically,  leukoplakia is of 2 types:\\n1.Hyperkeratotic type.  This is characterised by an\\norderly and regular hyperplasia of squamous epithelium\\nwith hyperkeratosis on the surface (Fig. 19.3, A) .\\n2. Dysplastic type.  When the changes such as irregular\\nstratification of the epithelium, focal areas of increased\\nand abnormal mitotic figures, hyperchromatism,\\npleomorphism, loss of polarity and individual cell\\nkeratinisation are present, the lesion is considered as\\nepithelial dysplasia. The subepithelial tissues usually\\nshow an inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes\\nand plasma cells. The extent and degree of the epithelial\\nchanges indicate the degree of severity of the epithelial\\ndysplasia. Usually, mild dysplasia may revert back to\\nnormal if the offending etiologic factor is removed,\\nwhereas severe dysplasia indicates that the case may\\nprogress to carcinoma. Erythroplasia  is a form of dysplastic\\nleukoplakia in which the epithelial atypia is more markedand thus has higher risk of developing malignancy. If the\\nepithelial dysplasia is extensive so as to involve the entire\\nthickness of the epithelium, the lesion is called carcinoma\\nin situ  which may progress to invasive carcinoma\\n(Fig. 19.3, B) .\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 19.3: Causes of White Lesions in the Oral Mucosa.\\nA.

MALIGNANT\\nSquamous cell carcinoma526SECTION III Systemic PathologyD. MALIGNANT TUMOURS\\nSquamous Cell (Epidermoid) CarcinomaOral cancer is a disease with very poor prognosis because it\\nis not recognised and treated when small and early.\\nINCIDENCE.  Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma\\ncomprises 90% of all oral malignant tumours and 5% of all\\nhuman malignancies. The peak incidence in the UK and theUSA is from 55 to 75 years of age, whereas in India it is from40 to 45 years of age. Oral cancer is a very frequentmalignancy in India, Sri Lanka and some Eastern countries,probably related to habits of betel-nut chewing and reversedsmoking (Chapter 8). There is a definite male preponderance.It can occur anywhere in the mouth but certain sites are morecommonly involved. These sites, in descending order offrequency, are: the lips (more commonly lower), tongue,anterior floor of mouth, buccal mucosa in the region ofalveolar lingual sulcus, and palate (Fig. 19.4) .\\nETIOLOGY.  As with other forms of cancer, the etiology of\\nsquamous cell carcinoma is unknown. But a number ofetiological factors have been implicated:\\nStrong association:\\ni)Tobacco smoking and tobacco chewing causing\\nleukoplakia is the most important factor as discussed above.i\\ni) Chronic alcohol consumption.\\niii) Human papilloma virus infection, particularly HPV 16,\\n18 and 33 types.\\nWeak association:\\ni) Chronic irritation from ill-fitting denture or jagged teeth.ii) Submucosal fibrosis as seen in Indians consuming excess\\nof chillies.\\niii) Poor orodental hygiene.\\niv) Nutritional deficiencies.v) Exposure to sunlight (in relation to lip cancer).\\nvi) Exposure to radiation.\\nvii) Plummer-Vinson syndrome, characterised by atrophy of\\nthe upper alimentary tract.\\nThe most common molecular alterations in oncogenes\\nseen in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity are in  p16,\\np53, cyclin D, p63, PTEN , and EGFR .\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  squamous cell\\ncarcinoma of oral cavity may have the following types(Fig. 19.5) :Figure 19.3 Leukoplakia oral mucosa. A,  Hyperkeratosis type . There is keratosis and orderly arrangement of increased number of layers of\\nstratified mucosa.  B, Dysplastic type . The number of layers is increased and the individual cells in layers show features of cytologic atypia and\\nmitosis but there is no invasion across the basement membrane.\\nFigure 19.4 Frequency of occurrence of squamous cell carcinomas\\nin the oral cavity.\\n527CHAPTER 19 The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glandsi) Ulcerative type —is the most frequent type and is\\ncharacterised by indurated ulcer and firm everted or rolled\\nedges.\\nii) Papillary or verrucous type —is soft and wart-like\\ngrowth.\\niii)Nodular type —appears as a firm, slow growing\\nsubmucosal nodule.iv) Scirrhous type —is characterised by infiltration into\\ndeeper structures.\\nAll these types may appear on a background of\\nleukoplakia or erythroplasia of the oral mucosa. Enlarged\\ncervical lymph nodes may sometimes be present.\\nHistologically,  squamous cell carcinoma ranges from\\nwell-differentiated keratinising carcinoma to highly-\\nundifferentiated neoplasm (Chapter 26). Changes ofepithelial dysplasia are often present in the surroundingareas of the lesion. Carcinoma of the lip and intraoralsquamous carcinoma are usually always well-\\ndifferentiated (Fig. 19.6) .\\nCarcinoma of the lip has a more favourable prognosis\\ndue to visible and easily accessible location and less frequent\\nmetastasis to the regional lymph nodes. However, intraoralsquamous carcinomas have poor prognosis because they aredetected late and metastasis to regional lymph nodes occurearly, especially in the case of carcinoma of tongue and softpalate. Verrucous carcinoma,  on the other hand, is composedof very well-differentiated squamous epithelium withminimal atypia and hence has very good prognosis.\\nOTHER MALIGNANT TUMOURS\\nOther less common malignant neoplasms which may be\\nencountered in the oral cavity are: malignant melanoma,lymphoepithelial carcinoma, malignant lymphoma,malignant tumours of minor salivary glands, and varioussarcomas like rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, alveolar softpart sarcoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Metastatictumours can also occur in the soft tissues of the mouth.\\nTEETH AND PERIODONTAL TISSUES\\nAlthough care of the teeth belongs to the field of dentalprofession, the fully educated medical doctor should befamiliar with certain principal diseases of teeth andperiodontal tissues, especially about dental caries, periapicalabscess and periodontitis, and common cysts andodontogenic tumours of the jaw. But first, a brief account ofnormal structure of these tissues is presented.\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe teeth are normally composed of 3 calcified tissues,\\nnamely: enamel , dentin  and cementum ; and the pulp which is\\ncomposed of connective tissue. The teeth are peculiar thanother calcified tissues of the body by being surrounded by\\nFigure 19.5 Squamous cell (Epidermoid) carcinoma of oral cavity, patterns of gross appearance.\\nFigure 19.6 Oral mucosa showing epithelial dysplasia progressing to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. There is keratosis, irregular stratif ication,\\ncellular pleomorphism, increased and abnormal mitotic figures and individual cell keratinisation, while a few areas show superficial invasive islands\\nof malignant cells in the subepithelial soft tissues.\\n528SECTION III Systemic Pathologythe portion of oral mucosa called the gingiva or gum, and\\nthat they are part of a highly specialised odontogenic\\napparatus; other parts of this apparatus being the mandibleand maxilla.\\nEmbryologically, odontogenic development takes place\\nfrom primitive structure, the dental lamina  or primitive oral\\ncavity, as follows:\\nInner epithelial layer of the dental lamina is ectoderm-\\nderived columnar to cuboidal oral epithelium calledameloblasts which secrete enamel matrix, also called enamelorgan.\\nMesoderm-derived connective tissue gives rise to\\nstructures in the dental papilla  (i.e. dental pulp or core of\\nloose connective tissue, blood vessels and nerves).\\nOuter margin of the dental papilla differentiates into\\nodontoblasts , which continue with ameloblastsic epithelium;\\nodontoblasts secrete dentin.\\nThe normal structure of tooth in an adult is as follows\\n(Fig. 19.7) :\\nEnamel  is the outer covering of teeth composed almost\\nentirely of inorganic material (as in bone) which can be\\ndemonstrated in ground sections only as it is lost in\\ndecalcified section.\\nDentin  lies under the enamel and comprises most of the tooth\\nsubstance. It is composed of organic material in the form of\\ncollagen fibrils as well as inorganic material in the form of\\ncalcium phosphates as in bone. Dentin is composed ofodontoblasts or dentin cells which are counterparts of\\nosteocytes in bone but differ from the latter in having\\nodontoblast processes. Dentin in the crown of tooth is coveredwith thicker layer of enamel.Cementum  is the portion of tooth which covers the dentin at\\nthe root of tooth and is the site where periodontal ligamentis attached. Cementum is similar to bone in morphology andcomposition.\\nDental pulp  is inner to dentine and occupies the pulp cavity\\nand root canal. It consists of connective tissue, blood vessels\\nand nerves.\\nNests of odontogenic epithelium are normally present in\\nthe jaw and may develop into cysts and tumours.\\nDENTAL CARIES\\nDental caries is the most common disease of dental tissues,\\ncausing destruct ion of the calcified tissues of the teeth.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Dental caries is essentially a\\ndisease of modern society, associated with diet containing\\nhigh proportion of refined carbohydrates. It has been known\\nfor almost \\n100 years that mixture of sugar or bread with\\nsaliva in the presence of acidogenic bacteria of the mouth,\\nespecially streptococci, produces organic acids which can\\ndecalcify enamel and dentin. Enamel is largely composed\\nof inorganic material which virtually disintegrates. Dentin\\ncontains organic material also which is left after\\ndecalcification. Bacteria present in the oral cavity cause\\nproteolysis of the remaining organic material of dentin,\\ncompleting the process of destruction. Diets rich in\\ncarbohydrates do not require much chewing and thus the\\nsoft and sticky food gets clung to the teeth rather than being\\ncleared away, particularly in the areas of occlusal pits and\\nfissures. ‘Bacterial plaques’ are formed in such stagnation\\nareas. If these plaques are not removed by brushing or by\\nvigorous chewing of fibrous foods, the process of tooth\\ndecay begins. There is evidence that consumption of water\\ncontaining one part per million (ppm) fluoride is sufficient\\nto reduce the rate of tooth decay in children.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Caries occurs chiefly in the\\nareas of pits and fissures, mainly of the molars and\\npremolars, where food retention occurs, and in the cervical\\npart of the tooth.\\nGrossly,  the earliest change is the appearance of a small,\\nchalky-white spot on the enamel which subsequently\\nenlarges and often becomes yellow or brown and breaks\\ndown to form carious cavity. Eventually, the cavity\\nbecomes larger due to fractures of enamel. Once the lesionFigure 19.7 The normal structure of tooth in longitudinal section\\nembedded in the jaw.\\nFigure 19.8 Dental caries. There is complete destruction of enamel,\\ndeposition of secondary dentine and evidence of pulpitis.\\n529CHAPTER 19 The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glandsreaches enamel-dentin junction, destruction of dentine\\nalso begins.\\nMicroscopically,  inflammation (pulpitis) and necrosis of\\npulp take place. There is evidence of reaction of the tooth\\nto the carious process in the form of secondary dentin,  which\\nis a layer of odontoblasts laid down under the originaldentine (Fig. 19.8) .\\nSEQUELAE OF CARIES.  Carious destruction of dental hard\\ntissues frequently produces pulpitis and other inflammatory\\nlesions like apical granuloma and apical abscess. Less\\ncommon causes of these lesions are fracture of tooth and\\naccidental exposure of pulp by the dentist.\\n1.Pulpitis.  Pulpitis may be acute or chronic.\\nAcute pulpitis  is accompanied by severe pain which may\\nbe continuous, throbbing or dull, and is accentuated by heat\\nor cold. It is often accompanied by mild fever and\\nleucocytosis.\\nChronic pulpitis  occurs when pulp is exposed widely. It is\\noften not associated with pain. Chronically inflamed pulp\\ntissue may protrude through the cavity forming polyp of the\\npulp. It may be partly covered by implanted squamous\\nepithelium.\\n2. Apical granuloma.  Pulpitis may lead to spread of\\ninfection through the apical foramen into the tissues\\nsurrounding the root of the tooth.\\nHistologically,  there is chronic inflammatory reaction\\nwith formation of granulation tissue and inclusion of nests\\nor strands of squamous epithelium derived from remnants\\nof odontogenic epithelium normally present in the\\nperiodontal membrane. An apical granuloma may\\ndevelop into a dental (radicular) cyst as discussed below.\\n3. Apical abscess.  An apical granuloma or acute pulpitis\\nmay develop into apical abscess. Acute abscess is very\\npainful, while pus in chronic abscess may escape through\\nroot canal and cause further complications like osteomyelitis,\\ncellulitis, cerebral abscess, meningitis and cavernous sinus\\nthrombosis.\\nPERIODONTAL DISEASE\\nChronic inflammation and degeneration of the supporting\\ntissues of teeth resulting in teeth loss is a common condition.\\nBesides inflammation, other diseases associated with gingi-\\nval swelling are leukaemia, scurvy, fibrous hyperplasia and\\nepulis.\\nThe inflammatory periodontal disease affects adults more\\ncommonly. Pregnancy, puberty and use of drugs like dilantin\\nare associated with periodontal disease more often. The\\ndisease begins as chronic marginal gingivitis, secondary to\\nbacterial plaques around the teeth such as due to calculus(tartar) on the tooth surface, impacted food, uncontrolled\\ndiabetes, tooth-decay and ill-fitting dental appliances. The\\ngingival sulcus acts as convenient site for lodgement of food\\ndebris and bacterial plaque leading to formation ofperiodontal pocket from which purulent discharge can be\\nexpressed by digital pressure.\\nMicroscopically,  chronic marginal gingivitis is charac-\\nterised by heavy chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate,\\ndestruction of collagen, and epithelial hyperplasia so as\\nto line the pocket. Untreated chronic marginal gingivitis\\nslowly progresses to chronic periodontitis  or pyorrhoea in\\nwhich there is inflammatory destruction of deeper tissues.At this stage, progressive resorption of alveolar bone\\noccurs and the tooth ultimately gets detached.\\nEPITHELIAL CYSTS OF THE JAW\\nThe epithelium-lined cysts of dental tissue can have\\ninflammatory or developmental origin. A classification of\\nsuch cysts is given in Table 19.4.\\nA.INFLAMMA \\nTORY CYSTS\\nRadicular Cyst\\nRadicular cyst, also called as apical, periodontal or simply\\ndental cyst, is the most common cyst originating from thedental tissues. It arises consequent to inflammation followingdestruction of dental pulp such as in dental caries, pulpitis,and apical granuloma. The epithelial cells of Mallasez, whichare nests of odontogenic epithelium embedded in theperiodontium, proliferate within apical granuloma under theinfluence of inflammation, leading to the formation of anepithelium-lined cystic cavity. Most often, radicular cyst isobserved at the apex of an erupted tooth and sometimescontains thick pultaceous material.\\nHistologically, the radicular cyst is lined by nonkera-tinised squamous epithelium. Epithelial rete processesmay penetrate the underlying connective tissues.Radicular cyst of the maxilla may be lined by respiratoryepithelium. The cyst wall is fibrous and contains chronicinflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells withRussell bodies and macrophages) hyaline bodies anddeposits of cholesterol crystals which may be associatedwith foreign body giant cells (Fig. 19.9) .\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 19.4: Classification of Epithelial Cysts of Jaw.\\nA.

The cyst wall isdensely infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells, chiefly lymphocytes, plasma\\ncells and macrophages.\\nB. DEVELOPMENTAL CYSTS\\nOdontogenic CystsDENTIGEROUS (FOLLICULAR) CYST. Dentigerous cyst\\narises from enamel of an unerupted tooth. The mandibular\\nthird molars and the maxillary canines are most ofteninvolved. Dentigerous cysts are less common than radicularcysts and occur more commonly in children and youngindividuals. These cysts are more significant because ofreported occurrence of ameloblastoma and carcinoma inthem.\\nHistologically,  dentigerous cyst is composed of a thin\\nfibrous tissue wall lined by stratified squamousepithelium. Thus, the cyst may resemble radicular cyst,except that chronic inflammatory changes so characteristicof radicular cyst, are usually absent in dentigerous cyst(Fig. 19.10) .\\nERUPTION CYST.  This is a cyst lying over the crown of an\\nunerupted tooth and is lined by stratified squamousepithelium. It is thus a form of dentigerous cyst.\\nGINGIVAL CYST.  It arises from the epithelial rests in the\\ngingiva and is lined by keratinising squamous epithelium.PRIMORDIAL CYST (ODONTOGENIC KERATOCYST).\\nPrimordial cyst, like dentigerous cyst, also arises from tooth-forming epithelium. The common location is mandibularthird molar.\\nHistologically,  the cyst wall is thin and is lined by regular\\nlayer of keratinising stratified squamous epithelium.Inflammatory changes are normally absent. Primordialcysts have a marked tendency to recur (50%). Multipleprimordial cysts occur in association with naevoid basalcell carcinoma syndrome.Non-odontogenic and Fissural Cysts\\nNASOPALATINE DUCT (INCISIVE CANAL, MEDIAN,\\nANTERIOR MAXILLARY) CYST.  This is the most common\\nnon-odontogenic (fissural) cyst and arises from the epithelialremnants of the nasopalatine duct.\\nHistologically,  the cyst is lined by stratified squamous\\nepithelium, respiratory epithelium, or both.\\nNASOLABIAL (NASOALVEOLAR) CYST.  This cyst is\\nsituated in the soft tissues at the junction of median nasal,lateral nasal and maxillary processes, at the ala of the nose,and sometimes extending into the nostril.\\nHistologically,  the cyst is lined by squamous or\\nrespiratory epithelium, or both.531CHAPTER 19 The Oral Cavity and Salivary GlandsGLOBULOMAXILLARY CYST.  This is an intraosseous cyst\\nand is rare.\\nDERMOID CYST.  The dermoid cyst is common in the region\\nof head or neck, especially in the floor of the mouth. The cyst\\narises from remains in the midline during closure ofmandibular and branchial arches.\\nODONTOGENIC TUMOURS\\nOdontogenic tumours are a group of uncommon lesions of\\nthe jaw derived from the odontogenic apparatus. Thesetumours are usually benign but some have malignantcounterparts. An abbreviated WHO classification ispresented in Table 19.5.\\nA.BENIGN ODONT\\nOGENIC TUMOURS\\nAmeloblastoma\\nAmeloblastoma is the most common benign but locally\\ninvasive epithelial odontogenic tumour. It is most frequentin the 3rd to 5th decades of life. Preferential sites are themandible in the molar-ramus area and the maxilla. Thetumour originates from dental epithelium of the enamel itselfor its epithelial residues. Sometimes, the tumour may arisefrom the epithelial lining of a dentigerous cyst or from basallayer of oral mucosa. Radiologically, typical picture is of amultilocular destruction of the bone. Rare instances of anextraosseous example, presence of an embedded tooth, orunilocular ameloblastoma can occur. Tumour with histologicresemblance to ameloblastoma can occur occasionally in thelong bone, like adamantinoma of the tibia (Chapter 28).\\nGrossly,  the tumour is greyish-white, usually solid,\\nsometimes cystic, replacing and expanding the affectedbone.Histologically,  ameloblastoma can show different\\npatterns as follows:i)Follicular pattern  is the most common. The tumour\\nconsists of follicles of variable size and shape andseparated from each other by fibrous tissue. The structureof follicles is similar to that of enamel organ consisting ofcentral area of stellate cells resembling stellate reticulum,and peripheral layer of cuboidal or columnar cellsresembling epithelium. The central stellate areas mayshow cystic changes  (Fig. 19.11) .\\nii)Plexiform pattern  is the next common pattern after folli-\\ncular pattern. The tumour epithelium is seen to formirregular plexiform masses or network of strands. Thestroma is usually scanty. Microcyst formation can occurin the stroma.\\niii)Acanthomatous pattern is squamous metaplasia within\\nthe islands of tumour cells.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 19.5: Classification of Odontogenic Tumours.\\nA.

The tumour is commonly associated withan unerupted tooth and thus closely resembles dentigerouscyst radiologically. Unlike ameloblastoma, adenomatoidodontogenic tumour is not invasive nor does it recur afterenucleation.\\nHistologically,  the lesion has extensive cyst formations.\\nThe wall of cyst contains scanty fibrous connective tissuein which are present characteristic tubule-like structurescomposed of epithelial cells and hence the name‘adenomatoid’ (gland-like).\\nCalcifying Epithelial Odontogenic Tumour\\nThis is a rare lesion which is locally invasive and recurrent\\nlike ameloblastoma. It is seen commonly in 4th and 5thdecades and occurs more commonly in the region ofmandible.\\nHistologically,  the tumour consists of closely packed\\npolyhedral epithelial cells having features of nuclearpleomorphism, giant nuclei and rare mitotic figures. Thestroma is often scanty and appears homogeneous andhyalinised in which small calcified deposits are seen whichare a striking feature of this tumour.\\nOdontogenic Myxoma (Myxofibroma)\\nOdontogenic myxoma is a locally invasive and recurring\\ntumour.\\nMicroscopically,  it is characterised by abundant mucoid\\nstroma and loose stellate cells in which are seen a fewstrands of odontogenic epithelium.\\nAmeloblastic Fibroma\\nThis is a benign tumour consisting of epithelial and connec-\\ntive tissues derived from odontogenic apparatus. It resemblesameloblastoma but can be distinguished from it becauseameloblastic fibroma occurs in younger age group (below20 years) and the clinical behaviour is always benign.\\nHistologically,  it consists of epithelial follicles similar to\\nthose of ameloblastoma, set in a very cellular connectivetissue stroma.Odontomas\\nOdontomas are hamartomas that contain both epithelial and\\nmesodermal dental tissue components. There are 3 subtypes:\\ni)Complex odontoma  is always benign and consists of\\nenamel, dentin and cementum which are not differentiated,\\nso that the structure of actual tooth is not identifiable.\\ni\\ni) Compound odontoma  is also benign and is comprised\\nof differentiated dental tissue elements forming a number of\\ndenticles in fibrous tissue.\\niii)Ameloblastic fibro-odontoma  is a lesion that resembles\\nameloblastic fibroma with odontoma formation.\\nCementomas\\nCementomas are a variety of benign lesions which are charac-\\nterised by the presence of cementum or cementum-like tissue.Five types of cementomas are described:\\ni)Benign cementoblastoma (true cementoma)  is a solitary\\nlesion of jaw, characterised by features comparable to those\\nof osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma.\\ni\\ni) Cementifying fibroma  consists of cellular fibrous tissue\\ncontaining calcified masses of cementum-like tissue.\\niii) Periapical cemental dysplasia (Periapical fibrous\\ndysplasia)  is most common and resembles cementifying\\nfibroma except that it contains more fibrous tissue as well ascementum-like tissue.\\niv) Multiple apical cementomas are found on the apical\\nregion of teeth and detected incidentally in postmenopausalwomen.\\nv) Gigantiform cementoma  is a large lobulated mass of\\ncementum-like tissue. Sometimes, there are multiple such\\nmasses in the jaw.\\nB. MALIGNANT ODONTOGENIC TUMOURS\\nMalignant odontogenic tumours are rare.\\nOdontogenic Carcinoma\\ni)Malignant ameloblastoma  is the term used for the\\nuncommon metastasising ameloblastoma.\\nii)Ameloblastic carcinoma  is the term employed for the\\nameloblastic tumour having cytologic features of malignancy\\nin the primary tumour.\\niii)Primary intraosseous carcinoma  may develop within the jaw\\nfrom the rests of odontogenic epithelium.iv)\\nRarely, carcinomas may arise from the odontogenic\\nepithelium lining the odontogenic cysts.\\nOdontogenic Sarcomas\\nThe only example of odontogenic sarcoma is a rare\\nameloblastic fibrosarcoma. This tumour resembles amelo-blastic fibroma but the mesodermal component in it ismalignant (sa rcomatous) whereas the ameloblastic\\nepithelium remains differentiated and benign.533CHAPTER 19 The Oral Cavity and Salivary GlandsSALIVARY GLANDS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThere are two main groups of salivary glands—major and\\nminor. The major salivary glands are the three paired glands:parotid, submandibu lar and sublingual. The minor salivary\\nglands are numerous and are widely distributed in themucosa of oral cavity. The main duct of the parotid glanddrains into the oral cavity opposite the second maxillarymolar, while the ducts of submandibular and sublingualglands empty in the floor of the mouth. At times, heterotopicsalivary gland tissue may be present in lymph nodes near orwithin the parotid gland.\\nHistologically,  the salivary glands are tubuloalveolar glands\\nand may contain mucous cells, serous cells, or both. The\\nparotid gland is purely serous. The submandibular gland ismixed type but is predominantly serous, whereas thesublingual gland though also a mixed gland is predominantlymucous type. Similarly, minor salivary glands may also beserous, mucous or mixed type.\\nThe secretory acini of the major salivary glands are\\ndrained by ducts lined by:\\nlow cuboidal epithelium in the intercalated portion,\\ntall columnar epithelium in the intralobular ducts, and\\nsimpler epithelium in the secretory ducts.\\nThe product of major salivary glands is saliva which\\nperforms various functions such as lubrication for swallow-\\ning and speech, and has enzyme amylase and antibacterialproperties too.\\nSALIVARY FLOW DISTURBANCES\\nSIALORRHOEA (PTYALISM).  Increased flow of saliva is\\ntermed sialorrhoea or ptyalism. It occurs commonly due to:\\nstomatitis, teething, mentally retarded state, schizophrenia,neurological disturbances, increased gastric secretion andsialosis (i.e. uniform, symmetric, painless hypertrophy ofsalivary glands).\\nXEROSTOMIA.  Decreased salivary flow is termed xero-\\nstomia. It is associated with the following conditions:\\nSjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, mumps parotitis, Mikulicz’ssyndrome, megaloblastic anaemia, dehydration, drug intake(e.g. antihistamines, antihypertensives, antidepressants).\\nSIALADENITIS\\nInflammation of salivary glands, sialadenitis, may be acute\\nor chronic; the latter being more common.\\nETIOLOGY.  Sialadenitis can occur due to the following\\ncauses:\\n1.Viral infections.  The most common inflammatory lesion\\nof the salivary glands particularly of the parotid glands, is\\nmumps occurring in children of school-age. It is characterisedby triad of pathological involvement—e pidemic parotitis\\n(mumps), orchitis-oophoritis, and pancreatitis  (Fig. 19.12) .\\nInvolvement of the testis and pancreas may lead to theiratrophy. Less commonly, cytomegalovirus infection mayoccur in parotid glands of infants and young children.\\n2.Bacterial and mycotic infections.  Bacterial infections may\\ncause acute sialadenitis more often. Sometimes there are\\nrecurrent attacks of acute parotitis when parotitis becomes\\nchronic.\\ni)Acute sialadenitis : The causes are as follows:\\na\\n) Acute infectious fevers\\nb) Acute postoperative parotitis (ascent of microorganisms\\nup the parotid duct from the mouth)\\nc) General debilityd) Old agee) Dehydration.\\nii)Chronic sialadenitis.  This may result from the following\\ncauses:\\na) Recurrent obstructive type.  Recurrent obstruction due to\\ncalculi (sialolithiasis), stricture, surgery, injury etc. may causerepeated attacks of acute sialadenitis by ascending infection\\nand then chronicity.\\nb) Recurrent non-obstructive type.  Recurrent mild ascending\\ninfection of the parotid gland may occur due to non-obstructive causes which reduce salivary secretion like due\\nto intake of drugs causing hyposalivation (e.g. antihista-\\nmines, antihypertensives, antidepressants), effect of\\nirradiation and congenital malformations of the duct system.\\nc) Chronic inflammatory diseases.  Tuberculosis, actinomycosis\\nand other mycoses may rarely occur in the salivary glands.\\n3. Autoimmune disease.  Inflammatory changes are seen in\\nsalivary glands in 2 autoimmune diseases:i)Sjögren’s syndrome  characterised by triad of dry eyes\\n(keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dry mouth (xerostomia) and\\nrheumatoid arthritis (Chapter 4).\\nii)Mikulicz’s syndrome  is the combination of inflammatory\\nenlargement of salivary and lacrimal glands with xerostomia.\\nFigure 19.12 Lesions in mumps.534SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nFigure 19.13 Pleomorphic adenoma (mixed salivary tumour) of the\\nparotid gland.

Irrespective of the under-\\nlying etiology of sialadenitis, there is swelling of the\\naffected salivary gland, usually restricted by the fibrouscapsule. Acute stage is generally associated with localredness, pain and tenderness with purulent ductaldischarge. Late chronic cases may be replaced by firmfibrous swelling.Microscopically,  acute viral sialadenitis  in mumps shows\\nswelling and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the acinarepithelial cells and degenerative changes in the ductalepithelium. There is interstitial oedema, fibrinoid degene-ration of the collagen and dense infiltration by mono-nuclear cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells and macro-phages).  Chronic and recurrent sialadenitis  is characterised\\nby increased lymphoid tissue in the interstitium,progressive loss of secretory tissue and replacement byfibrosis.\\nTUMOURS OF SALIVARY GLANDS\\nThe major as well as minor salivary glands can give rise to a\\nvariety of benign and malignant tumours ( Table 19.6) . The\\nmajor glands, particularly the parotid glands (85%), are themost common sites. Majority of parotid gland tumour (65-85%) are benign, while in the other major and minor salivaryglands 35-50% of the tumours are malignant. Most of thesalivary gland tumours originate from the ductal liningepithelium and the underlying myoepithelial cells; a few arisefrom acini. Recurrent tumours of the parotid glands, due totheir location, are often associated with facial palsy andobvious scarring following surgical treatment.\\nA. BENIGN SALIVARY GLAND TUMOURS\\nADENOMAS\\nThe adenomas of the salivary glands are benign epithelial\\ntumours. They are broadly classified into 2 major groups—pleomorphic and monomorphic adenomas.Pleomorphic Adenoma  (Mixed Salivary Tumour)\\nThis is the most common tumour of major (60-75%) and\\nminor (50%) salivary glands. Pleomorphic adenoma is thecommonest tumour in the parotid gland and occurs less oftenin other major and minor salivary glands. The tumour iscommoner in women and is seen more frequently in 3rd to\\n5th decades of life. The tumour is solitary, smooth-surfaced\\nbut sometimes nodular, painless and slow-growing. It is oftenlocated below and in front of the ear (Fig. 19.13) .\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  pleomorphic\\nadenoma is a circumscribed, pseudoencapsulated,rounded, at times multilobulated, firm mass, 2-5 cm indiameter, with bosselated surface. The cut surface is grey-white and bluish, variegated, semitranslucent, usually535CHAPTER 19 The Oral Cavity and Salivary Glandssolid but occasionally may show small cystic spaces. The\\nconsistency is soft and mucoid.Microscopically,  the pleomorphic adenoma is charac-\\nterised by pleomorphic or ‘mixed’ appearance in whichthere are epithelial elements present in a matrix of mucoid,myxoid and chondroid tissue (Fig. 19.14) :\\nEpithelial component  may form various patterns like\\nducts, acini, tubules, sheets and strands of cells of ductalor myoepithelial origin. The ductal cells are cuboidal orcolumnar, while the underlying myoepithelial cells maybe polygonal or spindle-shaped resembling smoothmuscle cells. The material found in the lumina of duct-like structures is PAS-positive epithelial mucin. Focalareas of squamous metaplasia and keratinisation may bepresent. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells areimmunoreactive for epithelial (cytokeratin, EMA, CEA)as well as myoepithelial (actin, vimentin and S-100)antibodies.\\nMesenchymal elements  are present as loose\\nconnective tissue, and as myxoid, mucoid and chondroidmatrix, which simulates cartilage (pseudocartilage)  but is\\nactually connective tissue mucin. the matrix of the tumourhas been characterised as a product of myoepithelial cellsas seen by S-100 immunostain positivity. However, truecartilage and even bone may also be observed in a smallproportion of these tumours.\\nThe epithelial and mesenchymal elements are inter-\\nmixed and either of the two components may be dominantin any tumour.\\nPROGNOSIS.  Pleomorphic adenoma is notorious for\\nrecurrences, sometimes after many years. The main factorsresponsible for the tendency to recur are incomplete surgicalremoval due to proximity to the facial nerve, multiple foci oftumour, pseudoencapsulation, and implantation in thesurgical field. Although the tumour is entirely benign, underexceptionally rare circumstances, an ordinary pleomorphicadenoma may metastasise to distant sites which too will havebenign appearance as the original tumour. However, actualmalignant transformation can also occur in a pleomorphicadenoma (vide infra).\\nMonomorphic Adenomas\\nThese are benign epithelial tumours of salivary glands\\nwithout any evidence of mesenchyme-like tissues. Theirvarious forms are as under:\\nWARTHIN’S TUMOUR (PAPILLARY CYSTADENOMA\\nLYMPHOMATOSUM, ADENOLYMPHOMA).  It is a\\nbenign tumour of the parotid gland comprising about 8% ofall parotid neoplasms, seen more commonly in men from4th to 7th decades of life. Rarely, it may arise in the submandi-bular gland or in minor salivary glands. Histogenesis  of the\\ntumour has been much debated; most accepted theory is thatthe tumour develops from parotid ductal epithelium presentin lymph nodes adjacent to or within parotid gland.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the tumour is\\nencapsulated, round or oval with smooth surface. The cutsurface shows characteristic slit-like or cystic spaces,containing milky fluid and having papillary projections.Microscopically,  the tumour shows 2 components:\\nepithelial parenchyma and lymphoid stroma (Fig.  19.15) :\\nEpithelial parenchyma  is composed of glandular and\\ncystic structures having papillary arrangement and islined by characteristic eosinophilic epithelium. Variantsof epithelial patterns include presence of mucous gobletcells and sebaceous differentiation.\\nLymphoid stroma  is present under the epithelium in\\nthe form of prominent lymphoid tissue, often withgerminal centres.\\nOXYPHIL ADENOMA (ONCOCYTOMA).  It is a benign\\nslow-growing tumour of the major salivary glands. Thetumour consists of parallel sheets, acini or tubules of large\\nFigure 19.14 Pleomorphic adenoma. The epithelial element is comprised of ducts, acini, tubules, sheets and strands of cuboidal and myoepithe lial\\ncells. These are seen randomly admixed with mesenchymal elements composed of pseudocartilage which is the matrix of myxoid, chondroid and\\nmucoid material.536SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nFigure 19.16 Mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The tumour shows\\ncombination of mucinous, squamous and intermediate cells and having\\ninfiltrative border.cells with glandular eosinophilic cytoplasm (oncocytes). It\\nis also called as mitochondrioma because of cytoplasmicgranularity due to mitochondria.\\nOTHER TYPES OF MONOMORPHIC ADENOMAS.\\nThere are some uncommon forms of monomorphicadenomas:\\ni)Myoepithelioma  is an adenoma composed exclusively of\\nmyoepithelial cells which may be arranged in tubular,\\nalveolar or trabecular pattern.\\ni\\ni) Basal cell adenoma  is characterised by the type and\\narrangement of cells resembling basal cell carcinoma of the\\nskin.\\niii) Clear cell adenoma  has spindle-shaped or polyhedral cells\\nwith clear cytoplasm.\\nMISCELLANEOUS BENIGN TUMOURS\\nA number of mesenchymal tumours can rarely occur in\\nsalivary glands. These include: fibroma, lipoma, neurilem-momas, neurofibroma, haemangioma and lymphangioma.\\nB. MALIGNANT SALIVARY GLAND TUMOURS\\nMucoepidermoid Carcinoma\\nThe status of ‘mucoepidermoid tumour’ as an intermediate\\ngrade tumour in the previous classification has undergoneupgradation to mucoepidermoid carcinoma now having thefollowing peculiar features:\\nIt is the most common malignant  salivary gland tumour\\n(both in the major and minor glands).\\nThe parotid gland  amongst the major salivary glands and\\nthe minor salivary glands in the palate  are the most common\\nsites.\\nCommon age group affected is 30-60 years but it is also\\nthe most common malignant salivary gland tumour affectingchildren and adolescents.It is the most common example of radiation-induced  malig-\\nnant tumour, especially therapeutic radiation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the tumour is\\nusually circumscribed but not encapsulated. It varies insize from 1 to 4 cm.Microscopically,  the tumour is classified into low, inter-\\nmediate and high grade depending upon the degree ofdifferentiation and tumour invasiveness. The tumour iscomposed of combination of 4 types of cells: mucin-producing, squamous, intermediate and clear cells. Well-differentiated tumours have predominance of mucinouscells, while poorly differentiated have more solid andinfiltrative pattern  (Fig. 19.16) .\\nFigure 19.15 Warthin’s tumour, showing eosinophilic epithelium forming glandular and papillary, cystic pattern with intervening stroma of\\nlymphoid tissue.537CHAPTER 19 The Oral Cavity and Salivary GlandsMalignant Mixed Tumour\\nMalignant mixed tumour comprises three distinct\\nclinicopathologic entities:\\nCarcinoma arising in benign mixed salivary gland tumour\\n(carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma);\\nCarcinosarcoma; and\\nMetastasising mixed salivary tumour.\\nCarcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is more common\\nwhile the other two are rare tumours. Approximately 2 to\\n5% of pleomorphic adenomas reveal areas of frankmalignancy. The slow-growing adenoma may have beenpresent for a number of years when suddenly it undergoesrapid increase in its size, becomes painful and the individualmay develop facial palsy. Malignant transformation occursin later age (6th decade) than the usual age for pleomorphicadenoma (4th to 6th decades). It may occur in primarytumour but more often occurs in its recurrences.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the tumour is\\npoorly-circumscribed with irregular infiltrating margin.Cut section may show haemorrhages, necrosis and cysticdegeneration.Microscopically,  besides the typical appearance of\\npleomorphic adenoma, malignant areas show cytologicfeatures of carcinoma such as anaplasia, nuclearhyperchromatism, large nucleolisation, mitoses andevidence of invasive growth. All types of usual salivarygland carcinomas (described below) may develop inpleomorphic adenoma.\\nAdenoid Cystic Carcinoma (Cylindroma)\\nThis is a highly malignant tumour due to its typical infil-\\ntrative nature, especially along the nerve sheaths. Adenoidcystic carcinoma is histologically characterised by cribriformappearance i.e. the epithelial tumour cells of duct-lining andmyoepithelial cells are arranged in duct-like structures ormasses of cells, having typical fenestrations or cyst-likespaces and hence the name ‘adenoid cystic’. These cysticspaces contain PAS-positive basophilic material  (Fig. 19.17) .\\nAcinic Cell Carcinoma\\nThis is a rare tumour composed of acinic cells resembling\\nserous cells of normal salivary gland. These cells are arrangedin sheets or acini and have characteristic basophilic granularcytoplasm. The degree of atypia may vary from a ben ign\\ncytologic appearance to cellular features of malignancy.Adenocarcinoma\\nAdenocarcinoma of the salivary gland does not differ from\\nadenocarcinoma elsewhere in the body. It may have somevariants such as mucoid adenocarcinoma, clear-celladenocarcinoma and papillary cystadenocarcinoma.\\nEpidermoid Carcinoma\\nThis rare tumour has features of squamous cell carcinoma\\nwith keratin formation and has intercellular bridges. Thetumour commonly infiltrates the skin and involves the facialnerve early.\\nUndifferentiated Carcinoma\\nThis highly malignant tumour consists of anaplastic epithe-\\nlial cells which are too poorly differentiated to be placed inany other known category.\\nMiscellaneous Malignant T umours\\nSome rare malignant tumour of epithelial and mesenchymal\\norigin are melanoma, sebaceous carcinoma, undifferentiatedcarcinoma, lymphoma, fibrosarcoma and leiomyosarcomaand are similar in morphology to such tumours elsewherein the body. Besides, metastatic involvement of major salivaryglands or the adjacent lymph nodes is common, especiallyfrom epidermoid carcinoma and malignant melanoma.\\nq\\nFigure 19.17 Adenoid cystic carcinoma. It shows nests of tumour\\ncells having fenestrations containing basophilic material.538SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nThe Gastrointestinal Tract Chapter 20Chapter 20\\nOESOPHAGUS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe oesophagus is a muscular tube extending from the\\npharynx to the stomach. In an adult, this distance measures25 cm. However, from the clinical point of view, the distancefrom the incisor teeth to the gastro-oesophageal (GE) junctionis about 40 cm. The region of proximal oesophagus at thelevel of cricopharyngeus muscle is called the upper oesophageal\\nsphincter, while the portion adjacent to the anatomic gastro-\\noesophageal junction is referred to as lower oesophageal\\nsphincter.\\nHistologically,  the wall of the oesophagus consists of\\nmucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria and adventitia/\\nserosa.\\nThe mucosa  is composed of non-keratinising stratified\\nsquamous epithelium overlying lamina propria except at thelower end for a distance of 0.5 to 1.5 cm. The basal layer ofthe epithelium may contain some melanocytes, argyrophilcells and Langerhans’ cells. At the lower end of theoesophagus, there is sudden change from stratifiedsquamous epithelium to mucin-secreting columnarepithelium; this is called the  junctional mucosa.\\nThe submucosa  consists of loose connective tissue with\\nsprinkling of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and occasionaleosinophil and mast cell. Mucus-producing glands arescattered throughout the submucosa.\\nThe muscularis propria  is composed of 2 layers of smooth\\nmuscle—an inner circular coat and an outer longitudinal coat.The proximal portion of oesophagus contains skeletal musclefibres from cricopharyngeus muscle. The parasympatheticnerve supply by the vagus nerve is in the form of extrinsicand intrinsic plexuses.\\nThe adventitia/serosa  is the outer covering of\\noesophagus. Serosa is present in intra-abdominal part ofoesophagus only, while elsewhere the perioesophagealadventitia covers it.\\nThe major functions  of oesophagus are swallowing by\\nperistaltic activity and to prevent the reflux of gastric contentsinto the oesophagus.\\nCONGENITAL ANOMALIES\\nCongenital anomalies of the oesophagus are uncommon and\\nare detected soon after birth. These include a few rareanomalies such as agenesis  (congenital absence of\\noesophagus) which is incompatible with life, duplication of\\noesophagus   (double oesophagus) and congenital stenosis  (i.e.\\nfibrous thickening of the oesophageal wall and atrophy ofthe muscularis propria). However, oesophageal atresia andtracheooesophageal fistula are relatively more common.\\nOESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA AND TRACHEO-OESO-\\nPHAGEAL FISTULA.  In about 85% of cases, congenital\\natresia of the oesophagus is associated with tracheo-oesophageal fistula, usually at the level of tracheal bifur-cation. For survival, the condition must be recognised andcorrected surgically within 48 hours of birth of the newborn.Clinically, the condition is characterised by regurgitation ofevery feed, hypersalivation, attacks of cough and cyanosis.Death usually results from asphyxia, aspiration pneumoniaand fluid-electrolyte imbalance.\\nMorphologically, the condition is recognised by cord-like\\nnon-canalised segment of oesophagus having blind pouchat both ends.\\nMUSCULAR DYSFUNCTIONS\\nThese are disorders in which there is motor dysfunction of\\nthe oesophagus, manifested clinically by dysphagia. Theseinclude achalasia, hiatus hernia, oesophageal diverticula, andwebs and rings.\\nAchalasia (Cardiospasm)\\nAchalasia of the oesophagus is a neuromuscular dysfunction\\ndue to which the cardiac sphincter fails to relax duringswallowing and results in progressive dysphagia anddilatation of the oesophagus (mega-oesophagus).\\nETIOLOGY.  There is loss of intramural neurons in the wall\\nof the oesophagus.  Most cases are of primary idiopathicachalasia which may be congenital. Secondary achalasia mayoccur from some other causes which includes:  Chagas’ disease(an epidemic parasitosis with Trypansoma cruzi ), infiltration\\ninto oesophagus by gastric carcinoma or lymphoma, certainviral infections,  and neurodegenerative diseases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  There is dilatation above\\nthe short contracted terminal segment of the oesophagus.Muscularis propria of the wall may be of normal thickness,hypertrophied as a result of obstruction, or thinned outdue to dilatation. Secondary oesophagitis may superveneand cause oesophageal ulceration and haematemesis.\\nHiatus Hernia\\nHiatus hernia is the herniation or protrusion of part of the\\nstomach through the oesophageal hiatus of the diaphragm.Oesophageal hiatal hernia is the cause of diaphragmatic539CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tracthernia in 98% of cases. The condition is diagnosed radio-\\nlogically in about 5% of apparently normal asymptomaticindividuals. In symptomatic cases, especially the elderlywomen, the clinical features are heartburn (retrosternalburning sensation) and regurgitation of gastric juice into themouth, both of which are worsened due to heavy work, liftingweights and excessive bending.\\nETIOLOGY.  The basic defect is the failure of the muscle\\nfibres of the diaphragm that form the margin of the\\noesophageal hiatus. This occurs due to shortening of theoesophagus which may be congenital or acquired.\\nCongenitally short oesophagus  may be the cause of\\nhiatus hernia in a small proportion of cases.\\nMore commonly, it is  acquired  due to secondary factors\\nwhich cause fibrous scarring of the oesophagus as follows:\\na) Degeneration of muscle due to aging.b) Increased intra-abdominal pressure such as in pregnancy,\\nabdominal tumours etc.\\nc) Recurrent oesophageal regurgitation and spasm causing\\ninflammation and fibrosis.\\nd) Increase in fatty tissue in obese people causing decreased\\nmuscular elasticity of diaphragm.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  There are 3 patterns in\\nhiatus hernia (Fig. 20.1) :\\ni) Sliding or oesophago-gastric hernia  is the most\\ncommon, occurring in 85% of cases. The herniated part ofthe stomach appears as supradiaphragmatic bell due tosliding up on both sides of the oesophagus.\\nii)\\nRolling or para-oesophageal hernia  is seen in 10% of\\ncases. This is a true hernia in which cardiac end of the\\nstomach rolls up para-oesophageally, producing anintrathoracic sac.\\niii)Mixed or transitional hernia  constitutes the remain-\\ning 5% cases in which there is combination of sliding and\\nrolling hiatus hernia.\\nOesophageal Diverticula\\nDiverticula are the outpouchings of oesophageal wall at the\\npoint of weakness. They may be congenital or acquired.Congenital diverticula  occur either at the upper end of\\nthe oesophagus or at the bifurcation of trachea.\\nAcquired diverticula  may be of 2 types:\\na) Pulsion (Zenker’s) type —is seen in the region of hypo-\\npharynx and occurs due to oesophageal obstruction such asdue to chronic oesophagitis, carcinoma etc. The mucosa andsubmucosa herniate through the weakened area or throughdefect in the muscularis propria.b) Traction type— occurs in the lower third of oesophagus\\nfrom contraction of fibrous tissue such as from pleuraladhesions, scar tissue of healed tuberculous lesions in thehilum, silicosis etc.\\nComplications of diverticula include obstruction, infec-\\ntion, perforation, haemorrhage and carcinoma.\\nOesophageal Webs and Rings\\nRadiological shadows in the oesophagus resembling ‘webs’\\nand ‘rings’ are observed in some patients complaining ofdysphagia.\\nWEBS.  Those located in the upper oesophagus, seen more\\ncommonly in adult women, and associated with dysphagia,\\niron deficiency anaemia and chronic atrophic glossitis(Plummer-Vinson syndrome) are called ‘webs’.\\nRINGS.  Those located in the lower oesophagus, not\\nassociated with iron-deficiency anaemia, nor occurring in\\nwomen alone, are referred to as ‘Schatzki’s rings’.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The rings and webs are\\ntransverse folds of mucosa and submucosa encircling theentire circumference, or are localised annular thickeningsof the muscle (Fig. 20.2). These give characteristic\\nradiological shadows.\\nHAEMATEMESIS OF OESOPHAGEAL ORIGIN\\nMassive haematemesis (vomiting of blood) may occur due\\nto vascular lesions in the oesophagus. These lesions are asunder:\\n1. OESOPHAGEAL VARICES.  Oesophageal varices are\\ntortuous, dilated and engorged oesophageal veins, seen along\\nFigure 20.1 Patterns of hiatus hernia.Figure 20.2 Oesophageal webs and rings.\\n540SECTION III Systemic Pathologythe longitudinal axis of oesophagus. They occur as a result\\nof elevated pressure in the portal venous system, mostcommonly in cirrhosis of the liver (Chapter 22). Less commoncauses are: portal vein thrombosis, hepatic vein thrombosis(Budd-Chiari syndrome) and pylephlebitis. The lesions occuras a result of bypassing of portal venous blood from the liverto the oesophageal venous plexus. The increased venouspressure in the superficial veins of the oesophagus may resultin ulceration and massive bleeding.\\n2. MALLORY-WEISS SYNDROME.  In this condition,\\nthere is lacerations of mucosa at the gastro-oesophageal\\njunction following minor trauma such as by vomiting,retching or vigorous coughing. Patients present with uppergastro-oesophageal bleeding.\\n3. RUPTURE OF THE OESOPHAGUS.  Rupture of the\\noesophagus may occur following trauma, during\\noesophagoscopy, indirect injury (e.g. due to sudden accele-ration and deceleration of the body) and spontaneous rupture(e.g. after overeating, extensive aerophagy etc).\\n4. OTHER CAUSES.  Oesophageal haematemesis may also\\noccur in the following conditions:\\ni) Bursting of aortic aneurysm into the lumen of oesophagus\\nii\\n) Vascular erosion by malignant growth in the vicinity\\niii) Hiatus hernia\\niv) Oesophageal cancerv) Purpurasvi) Haemophilia.\\nINFLAMMATORY LESIONS\\nInflammation of the oesophagus, oesophagitis, occurs most\\ncommonly from reflux, although a number of other clinicalconditions and infections may also cause oesophagitis asunder:\\nReflux (Peptic) Oesophagitis\\nReflux of the gastric juice is the commonest cause of\\noesophagitis.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Gastro-oesophageal reflux, to an extent,\\nmay occur in normal healthy individuals after meals and in\\nearly pregnancy. However, in some clinical conditions, thegastro-oesophageal reflux is excessive, resulting ininflammation of the lower oesophagus. These conditions areas under:i)Sliding hiatus hernia\\nii)\\nChronic gastric and duodenal ulcers\\niii) Nasogastric intubationiv) Persistent vomitingv) Surgical vagotomyvi) Neuropathy in alcoholics, diabeticsvii) Oesophagogastrostomy.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Endoscopically,  the\\ndemarcation between normal squamous and columnarepithelium at the junctional mucosa is lost. The affecteddistal oesophageal mucosa is red, erythematous, friableand bleeds on touch. In advanced cases, there are featuresof chronic disease such as nodularity, strictures,ulcerations and erosions.Microscopically,  the reflux changes in the distal\\noesophagus include basal cell hyperplasia and deepelongation of the papillae touching close to the surfaceepithelium. Inflammatory changes vary according to thestage of the disease. In early stage,  mucosa and submucosa\\nare infiltrated by some polymorphs and eosinophils; in\\nchronic stage,  there is lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis\\nof all the layers of the oesophageal wall.\\nBarrett’s Oesophagus\\nThis is a condition in which, following reflux oesophagitis,\\nstratified squamous epithelium of the lower oesophagus isreplaced by columnar epithelium (columnar metaplasia). Thecondition is seen more commonly in later age and is causedby factors producing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease(described above). Barrett’s oesophagus is a premalignantcondition evolving sequentially from Barrett’s epithelium(columnar metaplasia) → dysplasia → carcinoma in situ →\\noesophageal adenocarcinoma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Endoscopically,  the\\naffected area is red and velvety. Hiatus hernia and pepticulcer at squamocolumnar junction (Barrett’s ulcer) arefrequently associated.Microscopically,  the most common finding is the replace-\\nment of squamous epithelium by metaplastic columnarcells. Barrett’s oesophagus may be composed of intestinalepithelium, fundic gastric glands, or cardiac mucousglands. Other cells present in the glands may be Panethcells (Fig. 20.3) , goblet cells, chief cells, parietal cells,\\nmucus-secreting cells and endocrine cells.\\nInflammatory changes, acute or chronic, are commonly\\naccompanied. Dysplastic changes of the columnarepithelium or glands may be present.\\nSurveillance endoscopic biopsies are advised because\\nBarrett’s intestinal metaplasaia may develop dysplasia.\\nFigure 20.3 Barrett’s oesophagus. Part of the oesophagus which\\nis normally lined by squamous epithelium undergoes metaplastic change\\nto columnar epithelium of intestinal type.\\n541CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tract\\nA, Carcinoma oesophagus—sites of predilection for\\nsquamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. B, Gross patterns of\\nsquamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus.High-grade dysplasia may progress to invasive\\nadenocarcinoma of the oesophagus in up to 20% cases.\\nInfectious Oesophagitis\\nA number of opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed\\nindividuals can cause oesophagitis. Some of these agents areas follows:\\ni)Candida (Monilial) oesophagitis\\nii) Herpes simplex (Herpetic) oesophagitis\\niii) Cytomegalovirusiv) Tuberculosis.\\nOther Causes of Oesophagitis\\ni) Eosinophilic oesophagitis caused by radiation, corrosives\\nii) Intake of certain drugs (anticholinergic drugs,\\ndoxycycline, tetracycline)\\niii) Ingestion of hot, irritating fluids\\niv) Crohn’s disease\\nv) Various vesiculobullous skin diseases.\\nTUMOURS OF OESOPHAGUS\\nBenign tumours of the oesophagus are uncommon and small\\nin size (less than 3 cm). The epithelial benign tumours projectas intraluminal masses arising from squamous epithelium(squamous cell papilloma), or from columnar epithelium(adenoma). The stromal or mesenchymal benign tumours areintramural masses such as leiomyoma and others like lipoma,fibroma, neurofibroma, rhabdomyoma, lymphangioma andhaemangioma.\\nFor all practical purposes, malignant tumours of the oeso-\\nphagus are carcinomas because sarcomas such asleiomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma occur with extreme rarity.\\nCarcinoma of Oesophagus\\nCarcinoma of the oesophagus is diagnosed late, after\\nsymptomatic oesophageal obstruction (dysphagia) hasdeveloped and the tumour has transgressed the anatomicallimits of the organ. The tumour occurs more commonly inmen over 50 years of age. Prognosis is dismal: with standardmethods of therapy (surgical resection and/or irradiation),70% of the patients die within one year of diagnosis. Five-year survival rate is 5-10%.\\nETIOLOGY.  Although exact etiology of carcinoma of the\\noesophagus is not known, a number of conditions and factors\\nhave been implicated as under:\\n1. Diet and personal habits:\\ni) Heavy smoking\\nii) Alcohol consumption\\niii) Intake of foods contaminated with fungusiv) Nutritional deficiency of vitamins and trace elements.\\n2. Oesophageal disorders:\\ni) Oesophagitis (especially Barrett’s oesophagus in\\nadenocarcinoma)ii) Achalasiaiii) Hiatus herniaiv) Diverticulav) Plummer-Vinson syndrome.\\n3. Other factors:\\ni)Race —more common in the Chinese and Japanese than\\nin Western races; more frequent in blacks than whites.\\nii)Family history —association with tylosis (keratosis\\npalmaris et plantaris).iii)Genetic factors —predisposition with coeliac disease,\\nepidermolysis bullosa, tylosis.iv) HPV infection —is the recent addition in etiologic factors.\\nAt molecular level, abnormality of p53 tumour suppressor\\ngene has been found associated with a number of above riskfactors, notably with consumption of tobacco and alcohol,and in cases having proven Barrett’s oesophagus.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Carcinoma of the oeso-\\nphagus is mainly of 2 types—squamous cell (epidermoid)and adenocarcinoma. The sites of predilection for each ofthese 2 forms is shown in Fig. 20.4,A .\\nFigure 20.4542SECTION III Systemic PathologySQUAMOUS CELL (EPIDERMOID) CARCINOMA.\\nSquamous cell or epidermoid carcinoma comprises 90%of primary oesophageal cancers. It is exceeded in incidenceby carcinoma colon, rectum and stomach amongst all the\\ngastrointestinal cancers. The disease occurs in 6th to 7th\\ndecades of life and is more common in men than women.The sites of predilection are the three areas of oesophagealconstrictions. Half of the squamous cell carcinomas ofoesophagus occur in the middle third, followed by lowerthird, and the upper third of oesophagus in that order offrequency.\\nGrossly,  3 types of patterns are recognised (Fig. 20.4,B) :\\ni)Polypoid fungating type —is the most common form. It\\nappears as a cauliflower-like friable mass protruding into\\nthe lumen.ii)Ulcerating type —is the next common form. It looks\\ngrossly like a necrotic ulcer with everted edges (Fig. 20.5,\\nA).iii)Diffuse infiltrating type—appears as an annular,\\nstenosing narrowing of the lumen due to infiltration intothe wall of oesophagus.\\nMicroscopically,  majority of the squamous cell carcinomas\\nof the oesophagus are well-differentiated or moderately-\\ndifferentiated (Fig. 20.5, B) . Prickle cells, keratin forma-\\ntion and epithelial pearls are commonly seen. However,non-keratinising and anaplastic growth patterns can alsooccur. An exophytic, slow-growing, extremely well-differentiated variant, verrucous squamous cell carcinoma,\\nhas also been reported in the oesophagus.\\nADENOCARCINOMA.  Adenocarcinoma of the\\noesophagus constitutes less than 10% of primary\\noesophageal cancer. It occurs predominantly in men intheir 4th to 5th decades. The common locations are lowerand middle third of the oesophagus. These tumours have\\na strong and definite association with Barrett’s\\noesophagus in which there are foci of gastric or intestinal\\ntype of epithelium.\\nGrossly,  oesophageal adenocarcinoma appears as\\nnodular, elevated mass in the lower oesophagus.Microscopically,  adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus can\\nhave 3 patterns:\\ni)Intestinal type —is the adenocarcinoma with a pattern\\nsimilar to that seen in adenocarcinoma of intestine orstomach.ii)Adenosquamous type —is the pattern in which there is\\nan irregular admixture of adenocarcinoma and squamous\\ncell carcinoma.\\niii)Adenoid cystic type —is an uncommon variety and is\\nakin to similar growth in salivary gland i.e. a cribriformappearance in an epithelial tumour.\\nAdenocarcinoma of the oesophagus must be\\ndistinguished from adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia.This is done by identifying normal oesophageal mucosaon distal as well as proximal margin of the tumour.\\nOTHER CARCINOMAS.  Besides the two main\\nhistological types of oesophageal cancer, a few other\\nvarieties are occasionally encountered. These are as follow:\\ni)Mucoepidermoid carcinoma  is a tumour having\\ncharacteristics of squamous cell as well as mucus-secretingcarcinomas.\\nii)Malignant melanoma  is derived from melanoblasts in\\nthe epithelium of the oesophagus.\\niii)Oat cell carcinoma  arises from argyrophil cells in the\\nbasal layer of the epithelium.\\niv)Undifferentiated carcinoma  is an anaplastic carcinoma\\nwhich cannot be classified into any recognisable type of\\ncarcinoma.Figure 20.5 Squamous cell carcinoma oesophagus. A, Gross appearance. The tubular structure has thick muscle in its wall and has longitudinal\\nmucosal folds. There is a concentric circumferential thickening in the middle (arrow) causing narrowing of the lumen (arrow). T he mucosal surface\\nis ulcerated. B, Photomicrograph shows whorls of anaplastic squamous cells invading the underlying soft tissues.\\n543CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tractv)Carcinosarcoma  consists of malignant epithelial as well\\nas sarcomatous components.\\nvi)Secondary tumours  rarely occur in the oesophagus from\\ncarcinomas of the breast, kidney and adrenals.\\nSPREAD.  The oesophageal cancer spreads locally as well as\\nto distant sites.\\ni) Local spread.  This is the most important mode of spread\\nand is of great importance for surgical treatment. The local\\nspread may occur in the transverse as well as longitudinal\\ndirection. The tumour may invade below into the stomach,\\nabove into the hypopharynx, into the trachea resulting intracheo-oesophageal fistula, and may involve larynx causinghoarseness. The tumour may invade the muscular wall of\\nthe oesophagus and involve the mediastinum, lungs, bronchi,\\npleura and aorta.\\nii\\n)  Lymphatic spread.  Submucosal lymphatic permeation\\nmay lead to multiple satellite nodules away from the main\\ntumour. Besides, the lymphatic spread may result inmetastases to the cervical, para-oesophageal, tracheo-\\nbronchial and subdiaphragmatic lymph nodes.\\niii)  Haematogenous spread.  Blood-borne metastases from\\nthe oesophageal cancer are rare, probably because the death\\noccurs early due to invasion of important structures by othermodes of spread. However, metastatic deposits byhaematogenous route can occur in the lungs, liver andadrenals.\\nSTOMACH\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe stomach is ‘gland with cavity’, extending from its\\njunction with lower end of the oesophagus (cardia) to itsjunction with the duodenum (pylorus). The lesser curvatureis inner concavity on the right, while the greater curvature is\\nthe outer convexity on the left side of the stomach.\\nThe stomach has 5 anatomical regions (Fig. 20.6) :\\n1. Cardia  is the oesophagogastric junction and lacks the\\nsphincter.\\n2.Fundus  is the portion above the horizontal line drawn\\nacross the oesophagogastric junction.3.Body  is the middle portion of the stomach between the\\nfundus and the pyloric antrum.4.\\nPyloric antrum  is the distal third of the stomach.\\n5. Pylorus  is the junction of distal end of the stomach with\\nthe duodenum. It has powerful sphincter muscle.\\nThe mucosal folds in the region of the body and the\\nfundus are loose (rugae), while the antral mucosa is\\nsomewhat flattened. Gastric canal  is the relatively fixed\\nportion of the pyloric antrum and the adjoining lesser\\ncurvature; it is the site for numerous pathological changes\\nsuch as gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma.\\nThe stomach receives its blood supply from the left gastric\\nartery and the branches of the hepatic and splenic arteries\\nwith widespread anastomoses. Numerous gastric lymphatics\\nwhich communicate freely with each other are also present.The innervation of the stomach is by the vagi and branchesof the sympathetic which are connected with ganglia in the\\nmuscular and submucous layers.\\nHistologically,  the wall of the stomach consists of 4 layers—\\nserosa, muscularis, submucosa and mucosa.\\n1. Serosa  is derived from the peritoneum which is deficient\\nin the region of lesser and greater curvatures.2. Muscularis  consists of 3 layers of smooth muscle fibres—\\nthe outer longitudinal, the middle circular and the inner\\noblique. Nerve plexuses and ganglion cells are present\\nbetween the longitudinal and circular layers of muscle. The\\npyloric sphincter is the thickened circular muscle layer at\\nthe gastroduodenal junction.\\nFigure 20.6 Anatomical subdivisions of the stomach correlated with histological appearance of gastric mucosa in different regions. D1, D2, D3\\nand D4 are the first to fourth parts of the duodenum.\\n544SECTION III Systemic Pathology3. Submucosa  is a layer of loose fibroconnective tissue\\nbinding the mucosa to the muscularis loosely and contains\\nbranches of blood vessels, lymphatics and nerve plexusesand ganglion cells.4. Mucosa  consists of 2 layers—superficial and deep.\\nBetween the two layers is the lamina propria composed ofnetwork of fibrocollagenic tissue with a few lymphocytes,plasma cells, macrophages and eosinophils. The mucosa isexternally bounded by muscularis mucosae:\\ni) Superficial layer.   It consists of a single layer of surface\\nepithelium composed of regular, mucin-secreting, tall\\ncolumnar cells with basal nuclei. There is a very rapidturnover of these cells. These dip down at places to formcrypts (or pits or foveolae).\\nCardiac mucosa  is the transition zone between the oeso-\\nphageal squamous mucosa and the oxyntic mucosa of thefundus and body with which it gradually merges.\\nOxyntic mucosa  lines both gastric fundus and body.\\nAntral mucosa  lines the pyloric antrum.\\nii) Deep layer:  It consists of glands that open into the\\nbottom of the crypts. Depending upon the structure, theseglands are of 3 types:\\na)Glands of the cardia are simple tubular or compound\\ntubulo-racemose, lined by mucin secreting cells. A few\\nendocrine cells and occasional parietal and chief cells are alsopresent.\\nb)Glands of the body-fundus  are long, tubular and tightly\\npacked which may be coiled or dilated. There are 4 types of\\ncells present in the glands of body-fundic mucosa:\\nParietal (Oxyntic) cells—are the most numerous and line\\nthe superficial (upper) part of the glands. Parietal cells\\nare triangular in shape, have dark-staining nuclei andeosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells are responsible forproduction of hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice andthe blood group substances.\\nChief (Peptic) cells—are the dominant cells in the deeper(lower) parts of the glands. Their basal nuclei are largewith prominent nucleoli and the cytoplasm is coarselygranular and basophilic. These cells secrete pepsin of thegastric juice.\\nMucin-secreting neck cells—are small and fewer. Thesecells are present in the region of the narrow neck of thegastric glands i.e. at the junction of the glands with thepits.\\nEndocrine (Kulchitsky or Enterochromaffin) cells—arewidely distributed in the mucosa of all parts of thealimentary tract and are described later (page 561).\\nc)Glands of the pylorus  are much longer than the body-fundic\\nglands. These are simple tubular glands which are oftencoiled. They are lined mainly by small, granular, mucin-secreting cells resembling neck cells and occasional parietalcells but no chief cells. Gastrin-producing G-cells are present\\npredominantly in the region of antropyloric mucosa, with a\\nsmall number of these cells in the crypts and Brunner’s glandsof the proximal duodenum.\\nThe secretory products of the gastric mucosa are the\\ngastric juice  and the intrinsic factor , required for absorption of\\nvitamin B\\n12. Gastric juice consists of hydrochloric acid,\\npepsin, mucin and electrolytes like Na+, K+, HCO’3 and Cl–.Hydrochloric acid is produced by the parietal (oxyntic) cells\\nby the interaction of Cl’ ions of the arterial blood with water\\nand carbon dioxide in the presence of the enzyme, carbonicanhydrase. The degree of gastric activity is correlated withthe ‘total parietal cell mass’. Injection of histamine can\\nstimulate the production of acid component of the gastric\\njuice, while the pepsin-secreting chief cells do not respondto histamine. Physiologically, the gastric secretions arestimulated by the food itself.\\nThe control of gastric secretions  chiefly occurs in one of the\\nfollowing 3 ways:\\n1. Cephalic phase —is stimulated by the sight, smell, taste\\nor even thought of food. A neural reflex is initiated via\\nbranches of the vagus nerve that promotes the release ofhydrochloric acid, pepsinogen and mucus.\\n2. Gastric phase —is triggered by the mechanical and\\nchemical stimuli.\\ni)Mechanical stimulation  comes from stretching of the wall\\nof the stomach and conveying neural messages to the medulla\\nfor gastric secretion.ii)Chemical stimulation  is by digested proteins, amino acids,\\nbile salts and alcohol which act on gastrin-producing G cells.Gastrin then passes into the blood stream and on return tothe stomach promotes the release of gastric juice.\\n3. Intestinal phase —is triggered by the entry of protein-\\nrich food in the small intestine. An intestinal hormone capable\\nof stimulating gastric secretion is probably released into theblood stream.\\nGASTRIC ANALYSIS\\nIn various diseases of the stomach, the laboratory tests to\\nmeasure gastric secretions (consisting of gastric acid, pepsin,mucus and intrinsic factor) and serum gastrin are ofparticular significance (Table 20.1).\\nA.TESTS FOR GASTRIC SECRETIONS\\n1\\n. Tests for Gastric Acid Secretions\\nThe conventional fractional test meal (FTM) has been totallysuperseded by newer tests. These tests are based on the\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 20.1: Gastric Analysis.\\nA. TESTS FOR GASTRIC SECRETIONS\\n1. Tests for gastric acid secretions\\ni\\n) Histamine stimulation\\nii) Histalog stimulation\\niii) Pentagastrin (peptavlon) stimulation\\niv) Insulin meal (Hollander test)\\nv) Tubeless analysis\\n2. Tests for pepsin\\nPepsin inhibitors\\n3. Tests for mucus\\nProtein content of mucus\\n4. Tests for intrinsic factor\\nB. TESTS FOR GASTRIN\\n1. Serum gastrin\\n2. Gastrin provocation tests\\ni) Secretin test\\nii) Calcium infusion test545CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tractprinciple of measuring basal acid output (BAO) and maximal\\nacid output (MAO) produced by the stomach under the\\ninfluence of a variety of stimulants, and then comparing the\\nreadings of BAO and MAO with the normal values.\\nQuantitative analysis is performed after an overnight fast.\\nThe stomach is intubated and gastric secretion collected in 4\\nconsecutive 15-minute intervals. This unstimulated, one-hour\\ncollection after titration for the acid concentration in it, iscalled BAO, expressed in mEq 1-hour. Subsequently, thestomach is stimulated to secrete maximal acid which is\\nsimilarly collected for one hour and the acid content called\\nas MAO, expressed in mEq-1-hour. Two highest 15-minuteacid outputs are added and then multiplied by 2; this givesthe peak acid output (PAO).\\nThe tests for gastric acid secretion are named after the\\nstimulants used for MAO. Some of the commonly usedsubstances are as under:\\ni) HISTAMINE.  Histamine was the first standard stimulant\\nused for gastric acid secretion test. Subcutaneous injection\\nof histamine phosphate (0.04 mg/kg body weight) is given\\nwith simultaneous administration of antihistaminic agent to\\nprevent the untoward side-effects of histamine.\\nii) HISTALOG (BETAZOLE).  Subcutaneous injection of\\nhistalog (1-15 mg/kg body weight) is preferable over\\nhistamine due to fewer undesired side-effects and no needfor administration of antihistaminic agent.\\niii)PENTAGASTRIN (PEPTAVLON).  Pentagastrin is\\ncurrently the most preferred agent administered in the dose\\nof 6 μg/kg body weight. Its activity is similar to gastrin.\\niv) INSULIN MEAL (HOLLANDER TEST).  This test is\\nbased on the fact that in a state of hypoglycaemia, direct vagal\\naction on the parietal cell mass is responsible for acid\\nsecretion. Hypoglycaemia induced by intravenous insulin(15 IU soluble insulin) can be used as a test for evaluatingthe completeness of vagotomy. No increase in acid\\nproduction should occur if the vagal resection is complete.\\nv) TUBELESS ANALYSIS.  A resin-bound dye, diagnex\\nblue, is given orally. The release of dye by the action of gastric\\nacid and its appearance in the urine indicates the presenceof gastric acid. The test can be repeated after giving stimulantof gastric secretion.\\nSIGNIFICANCE\\nNormal value for BAO is 1.5-2.0 mEq 1-hour and for MAO is12-40 mEq 1-hour. In gastric ulcer, the values of BAO andMAO are usually normal or slightly below normal.\\nHigher values  are found in:\\nduodenal ulcer;\\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma); and\\nanastomotic ulcer.\\nLow value or achlorhydria  are observed in:\\npernicious anaemia (atrophic gastritis); and\\nachlorhydria in the presence of gastric ulcer is highly\\nsuggestive of gastric malignancy.\\n2. Tests for Pepsin\\nPepsin inhibitors are used for analysis of pepsin derived from\\npepsinogen for research purposes. The levels of pepsin arelow in atrophic gastritis.3. Tests for Mucus\\nProtein content of gastric mucus is measured, normal value\\nbeing 1.8 mg/ml. The level is increased in chronichypertrophic gastritis (Ménétrier’s disease).\\n4. Test for Intrinsic Factor\\nIntrinsic factor (IF) is essential for vitamin B\\n12 absorption from\\nthe small intestine. In its absence, the absorption of vitamin\\nB12 is impaired as occurs in chronic atrophic gastritis and\\ngastric atrophy. Schilling test  is used for evaluation of patients\\nwith suspected pernicious anaemia but can also be used as adiagnostic test for pancreatic insufficiency resulting in\\nimpaired absorption of vitamin B\\n12 since gastric R-binder\\nprotein is not cleared from intrinsic factor due to reduced\\npancreatic proteolytic activity. Schilling test is discussed onpage 308.\\nB. TESTS FOR GASTRIN\\nCirculating gastrin secreted by G-cells present in the\\nantropyloric and proximal duodenal mucosa is normally\\n0-200 pg/ml. It can be tested by the following methods:\\n1. Serum Gastrin Levels\\nRadioimmunoassay (RIA) is the commonly used method of\\nmeasurement of serum gastrin levels. Normal fasting values\\nare 20-150 pg/ml. The levels are high in:\\natrophic gastritis (with low gastric acid secretion);\\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome or gastrinoma (with high\\ngastric acid secretion); and\\nfollowing surgery on the stomach.\\n2. Gastrin Provocation Tests\\nThese tests are used to differentiate between hyper-\\ngastrinaemia and gastric acid hypersecretion as follows:\\ni) SECRETIN TEST.  An intravenous injection of secretin\\n(1 unit/kg body weight) is given. If the serum gastrin levels\\nrise by more than 50% of basal value in 5-15 minutes, it isdiagnostic of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma). Thisrise does not occur in other conditions.\\nii) CALCIUM INFUSION TEST.  Intravenous infusion of\\ncalcium (5 mg/kg per hour) is given for 3 hour. Rise in serum\\ngastrin levels by more than 50% of basal value is diagnosticof Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma).\\nCONGENITAL ANOMALIES\\nPancreatic Heterotopia\\nHeterotopic pancreatic tissue may present clinically as a\\ngastric mass or may be an incidental finding. Symptomaticcases may present in newborn or later in life.\\nGrossly,  it is seen as a mass projecting into the gastric\\nlumen, generally in the region of submucosa  and less often\\nin the muscular layer. In most cases, the mass is located in\\nthe region of antrum or pylorus.Microscopically,  both normal mature pancreatic acinar and\\nductal tissue are seen. Islets are seen in about a third of\\ncases.546SECTION III Systemic PathologyPyloric Stenosis\\nHypertrophy and narrowing of the pyloric lumen occurs\\npredominantly in male children as a congenital defect\\n(infantile pyloric stenosis). The adult form  is rarely seen, either\\nas a result of late manifestation of mild congenital anomalyor may be acquired type due to inflammatory fibrosis or\\ninvasion by tumours.\\nETIOLOGY.  The exact cause of congenital (infantile)  pyloric\\nstenosis is not known but it appears to have familial\\nclustering and recessive genetic origin. The acquired (adult)\\npyloric stenosis is related to antral gastritis, and tumours in\\nthe region (gastric carcinoma, lymphoma, pancreaticcarcinoma).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly and micros-copically,  there is hypertrophy as well as hyperplasia of\\nthe circular layer of muscularis in the pyloric sphincteraccompanied by mild degree of fibrosis (Fig. 20.7) .\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The patient, usually a first born\\nmale infant 3 to 6 weeks old, presents with the followingclinical features:1. Vomiting, which may be projectile and occasionally\\ncontains bile or blood.\\n2.Visible peristalsis, usually noticed from left to right side\\nof the upper abdomen.\\n3.\\nPalpable lump, better felt after an episode of vomiting.\\n4. Constipation.\\n5. Loss of weight.\\nMISCELLANEOUS ACQUIRED CONDITIONS\\nBezoars\\nBezoars are foreign bodies in the stomach, usually in patients\\nwith mental illness who chew these substances. Some of the\\ncommon bezoars are as follows:\\nTrichobezoars  composed of a ball of hair.\\nPhytobezoars  composed of vegetable fibres, seeds or fruit\\nskin.\\nTrichophytobezoars  combining both hair and vegetable\\nmatter.Acute Dilatation\\nSudden and enormous dilatation of the stomach by gas or\\nfluids due to paralysis of the gastric musculature may occur\\nafter abdominal operations, generalised peritonitis, and, inpyloric stenosis.\\nGastric Rupture\\nThe stomach may rupture rarely and prove fatal e.g. due to\\nblunt trauma, external cardiac massage, ingestion of heavy\\nmeal or large quantity of liquid intake like beer.\\nINFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS\\nThe two important inflammatory conditions of the stomach\\nare gastritis and peptic ulcer.  Rarely, stomach may be involved\\nin tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and Crohn’s disease.\\nGASTRITIS\\nThe term ‘gastritis’ is commonly employed for any clinical\\ncondition with upper abdominal discomfort like indigestionor dyspepsia in which the specific clinical signs and\\nradiological abnormalities are absent. The condition is of\\ngreat importance due to its relationship with peptic ulcerand gastric cancer. Broadly speaking, gastritis may be of 2types—acute and chronic. Chronic gastritis can further be ofvarious types.\\nA simple classification of various types of gastritis is\\npresented in Table 20.2.\\nAcute Gastritis\\nAcute gastritis is a transient acute inflammatory involvement\\nof the stomach, mainly mucosa.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  A variety of etiologic agents have\\nbeen implicated in the causation of acute gastritis. These are\\nas follows:\\n1.Diet and personal habits:\\nHighly spiced food\\nExcessive alcohol consumption\\nMalnutrition\\nHeavy smoking.\\n2. Infections:\\nBacterial infections  e.g. Helicobacter pylori, diphtheria,\\nsalmonellosis, pneumonia, staphylococcal food poisoning.Figure 20.7 Pyloric stenosis, infantile type.

Type A (autoimmune) : Body-fundic predominant\\n2. Type B (H. pylori- related) : Antral-predominant\\ngastritis\\n3. Type AB (mixed environmental) : Antral-body gastritis\\n4. Chemical (reflux) gastritis : Antral-body predominant5. Miscellaneous forms of gastritis\\n547CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal TractViral infections  e.g. viral hepatitis, influenza, infectious\\nmononucleosis.\\n3. Drugs:\\nIntake of drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, cortisone, phenylbutazone,\\nindomethacin, preparations of iron, chemotherapeuticagents.\\n4. Chemical and physical agents:\\nIntake of corrosive chemicals such as caustic soda, phenol,\\nlysol\\nGastric irradiation\\nFreezing.\\n5. Severe stress:\\nEmotional factors like shock, anger, resentment etc.\\nExtensive burns\\nTrauma\\nSurgery.\\nThe mucosal injury and subsequent acute inflammation\\nin acute gastritis occurs by one of the following mechanisms:\\n1.Reduced blood flow,  resulting in mucosal hypoperfusion\\ndue to ischaemia.\\n2.Increased acid secretion  and its accumulation due to H.\\npylori  infection resulting in damage to epithelial barrier.\\n3.Decreased production of bicarbonate buffer.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the gastric\\nmucosa is oedematous with abundant mucus and\\nhaemorrhagic spots.Microscopically,  depending upon the stage, there is\\nvariable amount of oedema and infiltration by neutrophilsin the lamina propria. In acute haemorrhagic and erosivegastritis, the mucosa is sloughed off and there arehaemorrhages on the surface.\\nChronic Gastritis\\nChronic gastritis is the commonest histological change\\nobserved in biopsies from the stomach. The microscopicchange is usually poorly correlated to the symptomatology,as the change is observed in about 35% of endoscopically\\nnormal mucosal biopsies. The condition occurs more\\nfrequently with advancing age; average age for symptomaticchronic gastritis being 45 years which corresponds well withthe age incidence of gastric ulcer.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  In the absence of clear etiology of\\nchronic gastritis, a number of etiologic factors have been\\nimplicated. All the causative factors of acute gastritis\\ndescribed above may result in chronic gastritis too. Recurrentattacks of acute gastritis may result in chronic gastritis. Someadditional causes are as under:\\n1.Reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach, especially in\\ncases which have undergone surgical intervention in the\\nregion of pylorus.\\n2.Infection with H. pylori  is strongly implicated in the\\netiology of chronic gastritis and is \\nmore common.3.Associated disease of the stomach and duodenum, such as\\ngastric or duodenal ulcer, gastric carcinoma.\\n4.Chronic hypochromic anaemia,  especially associated with\\natrophic gastritis.\\n5.Immunological factors  such as autoantibodies to gastric\\nparietal cells in atrophic gastritis and autoantibodies against\\nintrinsic factor.\\nThe mechanism  of chronic gastric injury by any of the\\netiologic agents is by cytotoxic effect of the injurious agenton the gastric mucosal epithelium, thus breaking the barrierand then inciting the inflammatory response.\\nCLASSIFICATION.  Based on the type of mucosa affected\\n(i.e. cardiac, body, pyloric, antral or transitional), a\\nclinicopathologic classification has been proposed(Table 20.2).\\n1. Type A gastritis (Autoimmune gastritis).  Type A gas-\\ntritis involves mainly the body-fundic mucosa. It is also called\\nautoimmune gastritis due to the presence of circulatingantibodies and is sometimes associated with otherautoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis andAddison’s disease. As a result of the antibodies againstparietal cells and intrinsic factor, there is depletion of parietalcells and impaired secretion of intrinsic factor. These changesmay lead to significant gastric atrophy where intestinalmetaplasia may occur, and a small proportion of thesepatients may develop pernicious anaemia. Due to depletionof gastric acid-producing mucosal area, there is hypo- orachlorhydria, and hyperplasia of gastrin-producing G cellsin the antrum resulting in hypergastrinaemia.\\n2.Type B gastritis ( H. pylori- related).  Type B gastritis\\nmainly involves the region of antral mucosa and is more\\ncommon. It is also called hypersecretory gastritis due toexcessive secretion of acid, commonly due to infection withH. pylori.  These patients may have associated peptic ulcer.\\nUnlike type A gastritis, this form of gastritis has noautoimmune basis nor has association with otherautoimmune diseases.\\n3\\n. Type AB gastritis (Mixed gastritis, Environmental\\ngastritis, Chronic atrophic gastritis).  Type AB gastritis affects\\nthe mucosal region of A as well as B types (body-fundic and\\nantral mucosa). This is the most common type of gastritis inall age groups. It is also called environmental gastritisbecause a number of unidentified environmental factors havebeen implicated in its etiopathogenesis. Chronic atrophicgastritis is also used synonymously with type AB gastritisbecause in advanced stage, there is progression from chronicsuperficial gastritis to chronic atrophic gastritis, characterisedby mucosal atrophy and metaplasia of intestinal orpseudopyloric type.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the features of allforms of gastritis are inconclusive. The gastric mucosa maybe normal, atrophied, or oedematous.Histologically,  criteria for categorisation are based on the\\nfollowing:i) Extent of inflammatory changes in the mucosa (i.e.superficial or deep).548SECTION III Systemic Pathologyii) Activity of inflammation (i.e. quiscent or active; acute\\nor chronic).iii) Presence of and type of metaplasia (i.e. intestinal or\\npseudopyloric).Based on above, following simple morphologic classi-fication has been proposed:1. Chronic superficial gastritis2. Chronic atrophic gastritis3. Gastric atrophy4. Chronic hypertrophic gastritis (Ménétrier’s disease)5. Uncommon forms of chronic gastritis.\\nHowever, Sydney system of recording of histologic\\nchanges in gastritis is more acceptable since it takes intoaccount following multiple parameters as well:i) Etiology  (H. pylori , autoimmune, NSAIDs, infections).\\nii) Location (pangastritis, predominant antral, predominant\\nbody-fundic).iii) Morphology (depth of inflammation—superficial or\\ndeep, severity of inflammation, type of inflammation,atrophy, metaplasia).iv) Some special features (e.g. granulomas, eosinophilic\\ngastritis, erosions, necrosis, haemorrhages).\\n1. CHRONIC SUPERFICIAL GASTRITIS.  As the name\\nsuggests there is inflammatory infiltrate consisting of\\nplasma cells and lymphocytes in the superficial layer ofthe gastric mucosa, but there are no histological changes in\\nthe deep layer of mucosa containing gastric glands . Chronic\\nsuperficial gastritis may resolve completely or mayprogress to chronic gastric atrophy.\\nH. pylori,  a spiral-shaped bacteria, was first reported\\nby Warren and Marshall in Australia in 1984 as inhabitantof the acid environment of the stomach causing gastritis.After intial skepticism, numerous workers subsequentlyverified its association with gastritis and peptic ulcer(Warren and Marshall shared Nobel Prize in medicine in2005 for their discovery). It is now known that H. pylori  iscausative for almost all active cases of chronic superficialgastritis and about 65% of quiscent cases. The organismis identified on the epithelial layer on the luminal surfaceand does not invade the mucosa (Fig. 20.8) . It is not seen\\non areas with intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori  gastritis can\\nbe diagnosed by the following techniques:i) Invasive tests  (Endoscopic biopsy):\\na) histologic examination combined with special stains foridentification of microorganism: Giemsa, Steiner silver orWarthin-Starry stains;b) biopsy urease test which is quick and simple but notfully sensitive; andc) culture of the microorganism that helps in determiningspecific antibiotic sensitivity.ii) Non-invasive tests :\\na) serologic tests (Immunoblot, ELISA) which are cheapand convenient but may not be helpful in early follow-upcases; andb) 14C urea breath test.\\nAlthough most patients of chronic superficial gastritis\\ndue to H. pylori  remain asymptomatic, they may develop\\nchronic atrophic gastritis, gastric atrophy, peptic ulcerdisease. H. pylori  infection is now considered an\\nindependent risk factor for gastric cancer: 3-6 foldincreased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma and 6-50 timesrisk of MALT lymphoma (Fig. 20.9) .\\n2.CHRONIC ATROPHIC GASTRITIS.  In this stage,\\nthere is inflammatory cell infiltrate in the deeper layer of themucosa and atrophy of the epithelial elements includingdestruction of the glands . Two types of metaplasia are\\ncommonly associated with atrophic gastritis:\\ni)Intestinal metaplasia.  Intestinal metaplasia is more\\ncommon and involves antral mucosa more frequently.\\nCharacteristic histologic feature is the presence ofintestinal type mucus-goblet cells; Paneth cells andendocrine cells may also be present. Parietal cells are veryFigure 20.8 Histologic appearance of H. pylori  chronic gastritis. A, Diagrammatic representation. B, H&E stained section. C, Demonstration of\\nH. pylori in Giemsa stain.\\n549CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tractfew or absent (Fig. 20.10) . Intestinal metaplasia, focal or\\nextensive, in atrophic gastritis is significant because its\\nincidence is high in populations having high prevalencerate of gastric cancer like in Japan. However, areas ofintestinal metaplasia are not colonised by H. pylori.\\nii)Pseudopyloric metaplasia.  It involves the body glands\\nwhich are replaced by proliferated mucus neck cells,conforming in appearance to normal pyloric glands. Itssignificance is not known.\\n3. GASTRIC ATROPHY.  In this, there is thinning of the\\ngastric mucosa with loss of glands but no inflammation\\nthough lymphoid aggregates may be present.\\n4. CHRONIC HYPERTROPHIC GASTRITIS (MÉNÉ-\\nTRIER’S DISEASE).  This is an uncommon condition\\ncharacterised pathologically by enormous thickening ofgastric rugal folds resembling cerebral convolutions,affecting mainly the region of fundic-body mucosa andcharacteristically sparing antral mucosa. The patientspresent with dyspepsia, haematemesis, melaena orprotein-losing enteropathy.\\nHistologically,  the gastric pits are elongated and are\\ntortuous. The mucosa is markedly thickened and parts ofmuscularis mucosae may extend into the thickened folds.\\nEpithelium-lined cysts are commonly seen in theglandular layer. Inflammatory infiltrate is usually mildbut lymphoid follicles may be present. The condition isconsidered significant in view of the risk of developingcancer.\\n5.\\nMISCELLANEOUS FORMS OF CHRONIC GAS-\\nTRITIS.  A few other types of gastritis which do not fit\\ninto the description of the types of gastritis described\\nabove are as under:\\ni) Eosinophilic gastritis.  This condition is characterised\\nby diffuse thickening of the pyloric antrum due to oedema\\nand extensive infiltration by eosinophils in all the layersof the wall of antrum. Eosinophilic gastritis probably hasan allergic basis.\\niii) Chronic follicular gastritis.  This is a variant of chronic\\natrophic gastritis in which numerous lymphoid follicles\\nare present in the mucosa and submucosa of the stomach.\\niv) Haemorrhagic  (Erosive) gastritis.  In this condition,\\nthere are superficial erosions and mucosal haemorrhages,\\nusually following severe haematemesis. The causes forsuch erosions and haemorrhages are duodenal-gastricreflux, administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs), portal hypertension.\\nv) Granulomatous gastritis.  Rarely, granulomas may be\\npresent in the gastric mucosa such as in tuberculosis,\\nsarcoidosis, Crohn’s disease, syphilis, various mycoses,and as a reaction to endogenous substance or foreignmaterial.\\nPEPTIC ULCERS\\nPeptic ulcers are the areas of degeneration and necrosis of\\ngastrointestinal mucosa exposed to acid-peptic secretions.Though they can occur at any level of the alimentary tractthat is exposed to hydrochloric acid and pepsin, they occurmost commonly (98-99%) in either the duodenum or thestomach in the ratio of 4:1. Each of the two main types maybe acute or chronic.Figure 20.9 Consequences of long-term H. pylori  gastritis.\\nFigure 20.10 A, Chronic atrophic gastritis (right) contrasted with normal pyloric mucosa (left). There is marked gastric atrophy with disappearance\\nof gastric glands and appearance of goblet cells (intestinal metaplasia). B, Photomicrograph showing chronic atrophic gastritis  with intestinal\\nmetaplasia.\\n550SECTION III Systemic PathologyAcute Peptic (Stress) Ulcers\\nAcute peptic ulcers or stress ulcers are multiple, small\\nmucosal erosions, seen most commonly in the stomach butoccasionally involving the duodenum.\\nETIOLOGY.  These ulcers occur following severe stress. The\\ncauses are as follows:\\ni)Psychological stress\\nii)Physiological stress  as in the following:\\nShock\\nSevere trauma\\nSepticaemia\\nExtensive burns (Curling’s ulcers in the posterior aspect\\nof the first part of the duodenum).\\nIntracranial lesions (Cushing’s ulcers developing from\\nhyperacidity following excessive vagal stimulation).\\nDrug intake (e.g. aspirin, steroids, butazolidine,\\nindomethacin).\\nLocal irritants (e.g. alcohol, smoking, coffee etc).\\nPATHOGENESIS.  It is not clear how the mucosal erosions\\noccur in stress ulcers because actual hypersecretion of gastric\\nacid is demonstrable in only Cushing’s ulcers occurring fromintracranial conditions such as due to brain trauma,intracranial surgery and brain tumours. In all other etiologicfactors, gastric acid secretion is normal or below normal. Inthese conditions, the possible hypotheses for genesis of stressulcers are as under:1.Ischaemic hypoxic injury to the mucosal cells.\\n2.Depletion of the gastric mucus ‘barrier’ rendering the\\nmucosa susceptible to attack by acid-peptic secretions.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  acute stress\\nulcers are multiple (more than three ulcers in 75% of cases).They are more common anywhere in the stomach,followed in decreasing frequency by occurrence in the firstpart of duodenum. They may be oval or circular in shape,usually less than 1 cm in diameter.Microscopically,  the stress ulcers are shallow and do not\\ninvade the muscular layer. The margins and base mayshow some inflammatory reaction depending upon theduration of the ulcers. These ulcers commonly heal bycomplete re-epithelialisation without leaving any scars.Complications such as haemorrhage and perforation mayoccur.\\nChronic Peptic Ulcers (Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers)\\nIf not specified, chronic peptic ulcers would mean gastric\\nand duodenal ulcers, the two major forms of ‘peptic ulcerdisease’ of the upper GI tract in which the acid-pepsinsecretions are implicated in their pathogenesis. Peptic ulcersare common in the present-day life of the industrialised andcivilised world.\\nGastric and duodenal ulcers represent two distinct\\ndiseases as far as their etiology, pathogenesis and clinicalfeatures are concerned. However, morphological findings inboth are similar and quite diagnostic. The features of gastricand duodenal peptic ulcers are described together belowwhile their contrasting features are presented in Table 20.3.\\nINCIDENCE.  Peptic ulcers are more frequent in middle-aged\\nadults. The peak incidence for duodenal ulcer is 5th decade,while for gastric ulcer it is a decade later (6th decade).Duodenal as well as gastric ulcers are more common in malesthan in females. Duodenal ulcer is almost four times morecommon than gastric ulcer; the overall incidence ofgastroduodenal ulcers being approximately 10% of the malepopulation.\\nETIOLOGY.  The immediate cause of peptic ulcer disease is\\ndisturbance in normal protective mucosal ‘barrier’ by acid-\\npepsin, resulting in digestion of the mucosa. However, incontrast to duodenal ulcers, the patients of gastric ulcer have\\nlow-to-normal gastric acid secretions, though true achlorhydria inresponse to stimulants never occurs in benign gastric ulcer.Besides, 10-20% patients of gastric ulcer may have coexistentduodenal ulcer as well. Thus, the etiology of peptic ulcerspossibly may not be explained on the basis of a single factorbut is multifactorial. These factors are discussed below butthe first two— H. pylori  gastritis and NSAIDs-induced injury\\nare considered most important.\\n1.Helicobacter pylori gastritis.  About 15-20% cases infected\\nwith H. pylori  in the antrum develop duodenal ulcer in their\\nlife time while gastric colonisation by H. pylori  never deve-\\nlops ulceration and remain asymptomatic. H. pylori  can be\\nidentified in mucosal samples by histologic examination,\\nculture and serology as discussed  on page 548.\\n2.NSAIDs-induced mucosal injury.  Non-steroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs are most commonly used medicationsin the developed countries and are responsible for directtoxicity, endothelial damage and epithelial injury to bothgastric as well as duodenal mucosa.\\n3. Acid-pepsin secretions.  There is conclusive evidence that\\nsome level of acid-pepsin secretion is essential for the\\ndevelopment of duodenal as well as gastric ulcer. Pepticulcers never occur in association with pernicious anaemia inwhich there are no acid and pepsin-secreting parietal andchief cells respectively.\\n4.Gastritis.  Some degree of gastritis is always present in\\nthe region of gastric ulcer, though it is not clear whether it is\\nthe cause or the effect of ulcer. Besides, the populationdistribution pattern of gastric ulcer is similar to that of chronicgastritis.\\n5\\n. Other local irritants.  Pyloric antrum and lesser curvature\\nof the stomach are the sites most exposed for longer periods\\nto local irritants and thus are the common sites for occurrenceof gastric ulcers. Some of the local irritating substancesimplicated in the etiology of peptic ulcers are heavily spicedfoods, alcohol, cigarette smoking, unbuffered aspirin.\\n6. Dietary factors.  Nutritional deficiencies have been\\nregarded as etiologic factors in peptic ulcers e.g. occurrence\\nof gastric ulcer in poor socioeconomic strata, higher incidenceof duodenal ulcer in parts of South India. However,malnutrition does not appear to have any causative role inpeptic ulceration in European countries and the U.S.551CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tract\\n7. Psychological factors.  Psychological stress, anxiety,\\nfatigue and ulcer-type personality may exacerbate as well\\nas predispose to peptic ulcer disease.\\n8. Genetic factors.  People with blood group O appear to be\\nmore prone to develop peptic ulcers than those with other\\nblood groups. Genetic influences appear to have greater rolein duodenal ulcers as evidenced by their occurrence infamilies, monozygotic twins and association with HLA-B5antigen.\\n9. Hormonal factors.  Secretion of certain hormones by\\ntumours is associated with peptic ulceration e.g. elaboration\\nof gastrin by islet-cell tumour in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,endocrine secretions in hyperplasia and adenomas ofparathyroid glands, adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary.\\n10. Miscellaneous.  Duodenal ulcers have been observed to\\noccur in association with various other conditions such asalcoholic cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, hyperpara-\\nthyroidism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, andchronic pancreatitis.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Although the role of various etiologic\\nfactors just described is well known in ulcerogenesis, two\\nmost important factors in peptic ulcer are as under:\\nExposure of mucosa to gastric acid and pepsin secretion.\\nStrong etiologic association with H. pylori infection.\\nThere are distinct differences in the pathogenetic\\nmechanisms involved in duodenal and gastric ulcers asunder:\\nDuodenal ulcer.  There is conclusive evidence to support the\\nrole of high acid-pepsin secretions in the causation of\\nduodenal ulcers. Besides this, a few other noteworthyfeatures in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcers are as follows:\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 20.3: Distinguishing Features of Two Major Forms of Peptic Ulcers.\\nFeature Duodenal Ulcer Gastric Ulcer\\n1. Incidence i)\\nFour times more common than gastric ulcers Less common than duodenal ulcers\\nii) Usual age 25-50 years Usually beyond 6th decade\\niii) More common in males than in females (4:1) More common in males than in females (3.5:1)\\n2.

There is generally hypersecretion of gastric acid into the\\nfasting stomach at night which takes place under the\\ninfluence of vagal stimulation. There is high basal as well asmaximal acid output (BAO and MAO) in response to variousstimuli.\\n2. Patients of duodenal ulcer have rapid emptying  of the\\nstomach so that the food which normally buffers and\\nneutralises the gastric acid, passes down into the smallintestine, leaving the duodenal mucosa exposed to theaggressive action of gastric acid.\\n3.Helicobacter  gastritis caused by H. pylori  is seen in 95-100%\\ncases of duodenal ulcers. The underlying mechanisms are\\nas under:\\ni) Gastric mucosal defense is broken by bacterial elaboration\\nof urease, protease, catalase and phospholipase.\\nii)Host factors: H. pylori -infected mucosal epithelium releases\\nproinflammatory cytokines  such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour\\nnecrosis factor- α, all of which incite intense inflammatory\\nreaction.iii)Bacterial factors: Epithelial injury is also induced by\\ncytotoxin-associated gene protein (CagA),  while vacuolating\\ncytotoxin (VacA)  induces elaboration of cytokines.\\nGastric ulcer.  The pathogenesis of gastric ulcer is mainly\\nexplained on the basis of impaired gastric mucosal defenses\\nagainst acid-pepsin secretions. Some other features in thepathogenesis of gastric ulcer are as follows:\\n1.Hyperacidity may occur in gastric ulcer due to increased\\nserum gastrin  levels in response to ingested food in an atonic\\nstomach.\\n2 However, many patients of gastric ulcer have low-to-\\nnormal gastric acid levels. Ulcerogenesis in such patients isexplained on the basis of damaging influence o\\nf other factors\\nsuch as gastritis, bile reflux, cigarette smoke etc.\\n3. The normally protective gastric mucus ‘barrier’ against\\nacid-pepsin is deranged in gastric ulcer. There is depletion\\nin the quantity as well as quality of gastric mucus. One ofthe mechanisms for its depletion is colonisation of the gastricmucosa by H. pylori  seen in 75-80% patients of gastric ulcer.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Gross and microscopic\\nchanges in gastric and duodenal ulcers are similar andquite characteristic. Gastric ulcers  are found predominantly\\nalong the lesser curvature in the region of pyloric antrum,more commonly on the posterior than the anterior wall.Most duodenal ulcers are found in the first part of the\\nduodenum, usually immediate post-pyloric, morecommonly on the anterior than the posterior wall.Uncommon locations include ulcer in the cardia, marginalulcer and in the Meckel’s diverticulum (Fig. 20.11) .\\nGrossly,  typical peptic ulcers are commonly solitary (80%),\\nsmall (1-2.5 cm in diameter), round to oval andcharacteristically ‘punched out’. Benign ulcers usuallyhave flat margins in level with the surrounding mucosa.The mucosal folds converge towards the ulcer. The ulcersmay vary in depth from being superficial (confined tomucosa) to deep ulcers (penetrating into the muscularlayer) (Fig. 20.12) . In about 10-20% of cases, gastric andduodenal ulcers are coexistent. Vast majority of the pepticulcers are benign. Chronic duodenal ulcer never turns\\nmalignant, while chronic gastric ulcer may develop\\ncarcinoma in less than 1% of cases. Malignant gastric ulcersare larger, bowl-shaped with elevated and induratedmucosa at the margin (Fig. 20.13) .\\nMicroscopically,  chronic peptic ulcers have 4 histological\\nzones. From within outside, these are as under (Fig. 20.14) :\\n1.Necrotic zone—lies in the floor of the ulcer and is\\ncomposed of fibrinous exudate containing necrotic debrisand a few leucocytes.2.Superficial exudative zone —lies underneath the necrotic\\nzone.

It is composed of nonspecific inflammatoryinfiltrate and proliferating capillaries.4.Zone of cicatrisation —is seen merging into thick layer\\nof granulation tissue. It is composed of dense fibrocolla-genic scar tissue over which granulation tissue rests.Thrombosed or sclerotic arteries may cross the ulcer whichon erosion may result in haemorrhage.Figure 20.11 Distribution of peptic ulcers.\\nFigure 20.12 Benign chronic peptic ulcer. Partial gastrectomy\\nspecimen showing a punched out round to oval ulcer on the mucosa,\\nabout 1 cm in diameter (arrow) and penetrating into muscularis layer.\\n553CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal TractCOMPLICATIONS.  Acute and subacute peptic ulcers\\nusually heal without leaving any visible scar. However,\\nhealing of chronic, larger and deeper ulcers may result incomplications. These are as follows:\\n1. Obstruction.  Development of fibrous scar at or near the\\npylorus results in pyloric stenosis. In the case of healed\\nduodenal ulcer, it causes duodenal stenosis. Healed ulcersalong the lesser curvatures may produce ‘hourglass’deformity due to fibrosis and contraction.\\n2. Haemorrhage.  Minor bleeding by erosion of small blood\\nvessels in the base of an ulcer occurs in all the ulcers and can\\nbe detected by testing the stool for occult blood. Chronicblood loss may result in iron deficiency anaemia. Severebleeding may cause ‘coffee ground’ vomitus or melaena. Apenetrating chronic ulcer may erode a major artery (e.g. leftgastric, gastroduodenal or splenic artery) and cause a massiveand severe hematemesis and sometimes death.\\n3. Perforation.  A perforated peptic ulcer is an acute abdo-\\nminal emergency. Perforation occurs more commonly in\\nchronic duodenal ulcers than chronic gastric ulcers.Following sequelae may result:i) On perforation the contents escape into the lesser sac orinto the peritoneal cavity, causing acute peritonitis.\\nii\\n) Air escapes from the stomach and lies between the liver\\nand the diaphragm giving the characteristic radiologicalappearance of air under the diaphragm.\\niii)Subphrenic abscess  between the liver and the diaphragm\\nmay develop due to infection.\\niv) Perforation may extend to involve the adjacent organs  e.g.\\nthe liver and pancreas.\\n4. Malignant transformation.  The dictum ‘cancers ulcerate\\nbut ulcers rarely cancerate’  holds true for most peptic ulcers.\\nA chronic duodenal ulcer never turns malignant, while less\\nthan 1% of chronic gastric ulcers may transform intocarcinoma.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES . Peptic ulcers are remitting and\\nrelapsing lesions. Their chronic and recurrent behaviour is\\nsummed up the saying: ‘once a peptic ulcer patient, always a\\npeptic ulcer patient.’  The two major forms of chronic peptic\\nulcers show variations in clinical features which are asfollows:\\n1. Age.  The peak incidence of duodenal ulcer is in 5th\\ndecade while that for gastric ulcer is a decade later.\\n2. People at risk.  Duodenal ulcer occurs more commonly\\nin people faced with more stress and strain of life (e.g.\\nexecutives, leaders), while gastric ulcer is seen more often inlabouring groups.\\n3. Periodicity.  The attacks in gastric ulcers last from 2-6\\nweeks, with interval of freedom from 1-6 months. The attacks\\nof duodenal ulcer, are classically worsened by ‘work, worry\\nand weather.’\\n4.Pain.  In gastric ulcer, epigastric pain occurs immediately\\nor within 2 hours after food and never occurs at night. In\\nduodenal ulcer, pain is severe, occurs late at night (‘hungerpain’) and is usually relieved by food.Figure 20.13 Chronic gastric ulcer (A) contrasted with malignant\\ngastric ulcer (B).\\nFigure 20.14 Chronic peptic ulcer. Histologic zones of the ulcer are illustrated in the diagram. The photomicrograph on right shows necrotic\\ndebris, ulceration and inflammation on the mucosal surface.\\n554SECTION III Systemic Pathology5. Vomiting.  Vomiting which relieves the pain is a conspi-\\ncuous feature in patients of gastric ulcer. Duodenal ulcer\\npatients rarely have vomiting but instead get heart-burn(retrosternal pain) and ‘water brash’ (burning fluid into themouth).\\n6. Haematemesis and melaena.  Haematemesis and\\nmelaena occur in gastric ulcers in the ratio of 60:40, while in\\nduodenal ulcers in the ratio of 40:60. Both may occur togethermore commonly in duodenal ulcer than in gastric ulcerpatients.\\n7. Appetite.  The gastric ulcer patients, though have good\\nappetite but are afraid to eat, while duodenal ulcer patients\\nhave very good appetite.\\n8. Diet.  Patients of gastric ulcer commonly get used to a\\nbland diet consisting of milk, eggs etc and avoid taking fried\\nfoods, curries and heavily spiced foods. In contrast, duodenalulcer patients usually take all kinds of diets.\\n9. Weight.  Loss of weight is a common finding in gastric\\nulcer patients while patients of duodenal ulcer tend to gain\\nweight due to frequent ingestion of milk to avoid pain.\\n10. Deep tenderness.  Deep tenderness is demonstrable in\\nboth types of peptic ulcers. In the case of gastric ulcer it is in\\nthe midline of the epigastrium, while in the duodenal ulcerit is in the right hypochondrium.\\nHAEMATEMESIS AND MELAENA OF GASTRIC ORIGIN\\nIn continuity with the discussion on peptic ulcers which are\\nthe commonest cause of haematemesis and melaena, it isworthwhile listing various causes of haematemesis of gastricorigin (causes of haematemesis of oesophageal origin arealready given on page 539).\\ni)Chronic peptic ulcers (gastric as well as duodenal)\\nii\\n) Acute peptic ulcers (stress ulcers)\\niii) Multiple gastric and duodenal erosions\\niv) Carcinoma of the stomach\\nv) Peptic ulcer in Meckel’s diverticulum\\nvi) Mallory-Weiss syndrome\\nvii) Anaemias\\nviii) Purpuras\\nix) Haemophilia.\\nTUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nThe various types of tumour-like lesions (polyps) and benign\\nand malignant tumours of the stomach are given inTable 20.4.\\nA. TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS (POL\\nYPS)\\nHyperplastic (Inflammatory) Polyps\\nHyperplastic or inflammatory polyps are regenerative, non-\\nneoplastic lesions which are the most common type (90%).They may be single or multiple and are more often locatedin the pyloric antrum.\\nGrossly,  the lesions may be sessile or pedunculated, 1 cm\\nor larger in size, smooth and soft. The surface may beulcerated or haemorrhagic.Microscopically,  they are composed of irregular\\nhyperplastic glands, which may show cystic change. Thelining epithelium is mostly superficial gastric type butantral glands, chief cells and parietal cells may be present.These lesions do not have cellular atypia and do not havemalignant potential.\\nHamartomatous Polyps\\nHamartomatous polyps are not true neoplasms but are\\nmalformations. They are of various types such as gastricpolyps of the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (page 582), juvenilepolyp, pancreatic heterotopia, heterotopia of Brunner’sglands and inflammatory fibroid polyps (eosinophilicgranulomatous polyps).\\nB. BENIGN TUMOURS\\nAdenomas (Adenomatous or Neoplastic Polyp s)\\nAdenomas, also, referred to as adenomatous or neoplastic\\npolyps, are true benign epithelial neoplasms and are muchrare in the stomach than in the large intestine. They are alsofound more often in the region of pyloric antrum. They arecommonly associated with atrophic gastritis and perniciousanaemia. Morphologically, adenomatous polyps of thestomach resemble their counterparts in the large bowel andare described on page 583.\\nS\\ntromal Tumours\\nStomach may be the site for occurrence of various uncommon\\nbenign tumours of stromal cell origin e.g. leiomyomas (beingthe most common); others are neurofibromas, schwannomasand lipomas. They are usually firm, circumscribed nodules,less than 4 cm in size and appear as submucosal nodules.They resemble in gross and microscopic appearance withtheir counterparts in other parts of the body.\\n Currently, the term gastrointestinal stromal tumours\\n(GISTs) is used for a group of uncommon benign tumours\\ncomposed of spindle cells or stromal cells but lacking the\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 20.4: Gastric Tumours and Tumour-like Lesions.\\nA.

They are uncommon but as compared toother sites in the GIT, are most common in the stomach. Theirbehaviour is generally benign but may be recurrent,aggressive or even metastasis may occur.\\nC. MALIGNANT TUMOURS\\nGastric CarcinomaINCIDENCE.  Carcinoma of the stomach comprises more\\nthan 90% of all gastric malignancies and is the leading cause\\nof cancer-related deaths in countries where its incidence ishigh. The highest incidence is between 4th to 6th decades oflife and is twice more common in men than in women.\\nETIOLOGY.  A number of etiologic factors have been\\nimplicated in causation of gastric cancer. These are as under:\\n1.H. pylori  infection.  H. pylori  infection of the stomach is\\nan important risk factor for the development of gastric cancer.\\nEpidemiologic studies throughout world have shown that aseropositivity with H. pylori  is associated with 3 to 6 times\\nhigher risk of development of gastric cancer. It may bementioned here that similar association of H. pylori  infection\\nexists with gastric lymphomas (MALT type) as well.\\n2. Dietary factors.  Epidemiological studies suggest that die-\\ntary factors are most significant in the etiology of gastric\\ncancer. The evidences in support of this are multifold:i)Occurrence of gastric cancer in the region of gastric canal\\n(i.e. along the lesser curvature and the pyloric antrum) whereirritating foods exert their maximum effect.i\\ni) Populations consuming certain foodstuffs have high risk\\nof developing gastric cancer e.g. ingestion of smoked foods,high intake of salt, pickled raw vegetables, high intake ofcarcinogens as nitrates in foods and drinking water, nitritesas preservatives for certain meats etc. However, intake ofgreen leafy vegetables, citrus fruits and animal fats has beenreported to have protective role in gastric cancer.iii) Tobacco smoke, tobacco juice and consumption of alcoholhave all been shown to have carcinogenic effect on gastricmucosa.\\n3. Geographical factors.  There are geographic variations\\nin the incidence of gastric cancer. Japan, Chile and Italy have\\nthe highest recorded death rate from gastric cancer, whilethe incidence is considerably low in the US, UK and Canada.The higher incidence in certain geographic regions is theresult of environmental influences as observed from thefinding of incidence of gastric cancer in the next generationof Japanese immigrants to the US which is comparable tothat of native Americans.\\n4. Racial factors.  Within the country, different ethnic groups\\nmay have variations in incidence of gastric cancer e.g.\\nincidence is higher in Blacks, American Indians, Chinese inIndonesia, North Wales than other parts of Wales.\\n5. Genetic factors.  Genetic influences have some role in the\\netiology of gastric cancer. Not more than 4% of patients of\\ngastric cancer have a family history of this disease.Individuals with blood group A have higher tendency todevelop gastric cancer (Recall that the peptic ulcer is morecommon in individuals with blood group O). A germ linemutation in E-cadherin gene inherited as a autosomaldominant pattern  has been linked to higher incidence ofoccult gastric cancer in younger individuals.\\n6. Pre-malignant changes in the gastric mucosa.  There are\\nsome conditions of gastric mucosa which have increased risk\\nto development of gastric cancer:i) Hypo- or achlorhydria in atrophic gastritis of gastricmucosa with intestinal metaplasia.ii) Adenomatous (neoplastic) polyps of the stomach.iii) Chronic gastric ulcer (ulcer-cancer), and its associationwith achlorhydria.iv) Stump carcinoma in patients who have undergone partialgastrectomy.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Gastric carcinoma is most\\ncommonly located in the region of gastric canal (prepyloricregion) formed by lesser curvature, pylorus and antrum.Other less common locations are the body, cardia andfundus (Fig. 20.15) .\\nPathogenetically, a sequential evolution of all gastric\\ncarcinomas from an initial stage of in situ  carcinoma\\nconfined to mucosal layers called early gastric carcinoma(EGC) has been found. EGC eventually penetrates themuscularis or beyond, resulting in advanced gastriccarcinoma. Accordingly, gastric carcinomas are broadlyclassified into 2 main groups:I.Early gastric carcinoma (EGC).\\nII.Advanced gastric carcinoma,  which has 5 further major\\ngross subtypes:i)Ulcerative carcinoma\\nii)\\nFungating (Polypoid) carcinoma\\niii) Scirrhous carcinoma (Linitis plastica)iv) Colloid (Mucoid) carcinomav) Ulcer-cancer\\nIn addition to the above classification, gastric\\ncarcinomas have been classified, on the basis of extent of\\ninvasion,  into 2 groups:Figure 20.15 Distribution of gastric carcinoma in the anatomical\\nsubdivisions of the stomach. The serial numbers in the figure indicate\\nthe order of frequency of occurrence of gastric cancer.\\n556SECTION III Systemic PathologyI.  Expanding (formerly intestinal type) carcinomas  that\\ngrow laterally by an invasive margin. The tumour cells\\nare in the form of cohesive clusters.II.Infiltrating (formerly diffuse type) carcinomas  have\\npoorly-defined invasive border. The tumour cells are looseand invade singly or in small group.\\nThese classifications are summarised in Fig. 20.16  and\\ncomparative morphology of various types is showndiagrammatically in Fig. 20.18 .\\nI. EARLY GASTRIC CARCINOMA (EGC)  (Fig.\\n20.18,A).  EGC is the term used to describe cancer limited\\nto the mucosa and submucosa. The diagnosis of thiscondition has been made possible by extensive work onhistogenesis of gastric cancer by Japanese pathologists bythe use of fibreoptic endoscope and gastrocamera. InJapan, EGC comprises 35% of newly-diagnosed cases ofgastric cancer.\\nGrossly,  the lesion of EGC may have 3 patterns—polypoid\\n(protruded), superficial and ulcerated (Fig. 20.17) :\\nType I : Polypoid type\\nType IIa :\\nSuperficial elevated\\nType II b : Superficial flat\\nType II c : Superficial depressed\\nType III : Ulcerated type\\nHistologically , EGC is a typical glandular adeno-\\ncarcinoma, usually well-differentiated type.Prognosis of EGC after surgical resection is quite good;\\n5-year survival rate being 93-99%.\\nEarly gastric carcinoma must be distinguished from\\ncertain related terms as under:\\nEpithelial dysplasia  is cellular atypia seen in intestinal\\nmetaplasia such as in atrophic gastritis and pernicious\\nanaemia.\\nCarcinoma in situ  in the stomach is a state of severe\\ncellular atypia or dysplasia, without invasion across thebasement membrane of the glands.\\nII. ADVANCED GASTRIC CARCINOMA.  When the\\ncarcinoma crosses the basement membrane into the\\nmuscularis propria or beyond, it is referred to as advancedgastric carcinoma. Advanced gastric carcinoma hasfollowing 5 patterns:\\ni) Ulcerative carcinoma (Fig. 20.18,B) .  This is the most\\ncommon pattern. The tumour appears as a flat, infiltrating\\nand ulcerative growth with irregular necrotic base andraised margin. It is seen more commonly in the region ofgastric canal (Fig. 20.19,A) .\\nHistologically,  ulcerative carcinomas are poorly-\\ndifferentiated adenocarcinomas, which invade deeply intothe stomach wall. Tubular and acinar patterns are seenmore commonly (Fig. 20.19, B) .\\nii) Fungating (polypoid) carcinoma (Fig. 20.18,C) . The\\nsecond common pattern is a cauliflower growth projectinginto the lumen, similar to what is commonly seen in theFigure 20.16 Classifications of gastric carcinomas. A, Conventional classification, showing correlation of the macroscopic subtypes with the\\nmain histological patterns. B, Classification based on the depth of invasion by the tumour.\\nFigure 20.17 Diagrammatic representation of gross patterns of early gastric carcinoma.\\n557CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tractlarge intestine. It is seen more often in the fundus. The\\ntumour undergoes necrosis and infection commonly.Histologically,  fungating or polypoid carcinomas are\\nwell-differentiated adenocarcinomas, commonly papillarytype.\\niii)Scirrhous carcinoma (Linitis plastica) (Fig. 20.18,D) .\\nIn this pattern, the stomach wall is thickened due to\\nextensive desmoplasia giving the appearance as ‘leather-bottle stomach’ or ‘linitis plastica’. The involvement maybe localised to pyloric antrum, or diffuse affecting wholeof the stomach from the cardia to pylorus. The lumen ofthe stomach is reduced. There are no ulcers but rugae areprominent (Fig. 20.19,C) .\\nHistologically,  it may be an adenocarcinoma or signet-\\nring cell carcinoma, extensively infiltrating the stomachwall, but due to marked desmoplasia cancer cells may bedifficult to find (Fig. 20.19,D) .\\niv)\\nColloid (Mucoid) carcinoma (Fig. 20.18,E) . This\\npattern is usually seen in the fundus. The tumour growslike masses having gelatinous appearance due to secretionof large quantities of mucus.Histologically,  mucoid carcinoma contains abundant\\npools of mucin in which are seen a small number oftumour cells, sometimes having signet-ring appearance.\\nv)Ulcer-cancer (Fig. 20.18,F) . Development of cancer in\\nchronic gastric ulcer is a rare occurrence (less than 1%).\\nMajority of ulcer-cancers are malignant lesions from thebeginning. For confirmation of cancer in a pre-existing\\ngastric ulcer, the characteristic microscopic appearance of\\npeptic ulcer should be demonstrable with one portion ofthe base or the margin of the ulcer showing carcinomatouschanges.Histologically,  ulcer-cancers are adenocarcinomas\\nwithout any specific features. The differences between abenign and malignant gastric ulcer are summarised inTable 20.5  (also see Fig. 20.13).SPREAD.  Carcinoma of the stomach may spread by the\\nfollowing routes:\\n1.Direct spread.  Direct spread by local extension is the most\\ncommon feature of gastric carcinoma. The spread occurs\\nmainly from the loose submucosal layer but eventuallymuscularis and serosa are also invaded. After the peritonealcovering of the stomach has been invaded, transcoelomicdissemination may occur in any other part of the peritonealcavity but ovarian masses (one sided or both-sided) occurmore commonly, referred to as Krukenberg tumours  (Chapter\\n24). Submucosal spread occurs more often upwards into theoesophagus due to continuity of the layers of stomach withthose of oesophagus, while the spread downwards into theduodenum occurs less often due to the presence of pyloricsphincter and submucosal Brunner’s glands. The tumourmay directly involve other neighbouring structures andorgans like lesser and greater omentum, pancreas, liver,common bile duct, diaphragm, spleen and transverse colon.\\n2.\\nLymphatic spread.  Metastases to regional lymph nodes\\noccur early, especially in the scirrhous carcinoma. The groups\\nof lymph nodes involved are along the lesser and greatercurvature around the cardia and suprapancreatic lymphnodes. Involvement of left supraclavicular lymph node,Virchow or Troisier’s sign,  is sometimes the presenting feature\\nof gastric carcinoma.\\n3. Haematogenous spread.  Blood spread of gastric\\ncarcinoma may occur to the liver, lungs, brain, bones, kidneys\\nand adrenals. It occurs more commonly with the poorly-differentiated carcinoma.\\nThe American Joint Committee on Cancer has developed\\nTNM staging  system for gastric carcinoma based on tumour\\ninvasion (T), lymph node involvement (N) and distantmetastasis (M) into earliest stage T\\nis N0 M0 (intraepithelial\\ntumour) to most advanced stage Tany Nany M1.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Gastric carcinoma may have diverse\\npresentations. The usual clinical features are as under:i) Persistent abdominal pain\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 20.5: Differences between Benign and Malignant Gastric Ulcers.\\nFeature Benign Ulcer Malignant Ulcer\\n1.

Therefore, the prognosis is generallypoor; 5-year survival rate being 5-15% from the time ofdiagnosis of advanced gastric carcinoma. However, 5-yearsurvival rate for early gastric carcinoma is far higher(93-99%) and hence the need for early diagnosis of thecondition.Figure 20.18 Gastric carcinoma, gross appearance of subtypes and their corresponding dominant histological patterns.\\n559CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal TractOther Carcinomas\\nBesides the various morphologic patterns of adenocarcinoma\\njust described, other carcinomas that occur rarely in thestomach are: adenosquamous carcinoma, squamous cellcarcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma, all of which aremorphologically similar to such tumours elsewhere.\\nLeiomyosarcoma\\nLeiomyosarcoma, though rare, is the commonest soft tissue\\nsarcoma, the stomach being the more common site in thegastrointestinal tract.\\nGrossly,  the tumour may be of variable size but is usually\\nquite large, pedunculated and lobulated mass  into the\\nlumen.Microscopically,  leiomyosarcoma is characterised by high\\ncellularity and presence of mitotic figures. Tumour isusually well-differentiated.\\nLeiomyoblastoma (Epithelioid Leiomyoma)\\nThis is a rare tumour, the behaviour of which is intermediate\\nbetween clearly benign and malignant tumour.\\nGrossly,  the tumour is large, circumscribed and projects\\ninto the lumen.\\nMicroscopically , it is characterised by round to polygonal\\ncells with clear perinuclear halos. The number of mitoses\\ndetermines the biological behaviour of the tumour.Carcinoid T\\numour\\nCarcinoid tumours are rare in the stomach and are usuallynon-argentaffin type but argentaffinomas also occur. Theirbehaviour is usually malignant; they are described onpage 579.\\nLymphomas of Gut\\nPrimary gastrointestinal lymphomas  are defined as\\nlymphomas arising in the gut without any evidence of\\nsystemic involvement at the time of presentation.\\nSecondary gastrointestinal lymphomas,  on the other hand,\\nappear in the gut after dissemination from other primary\\nsite.\\nGastric lymphomas constitute over 50% of all bowel\\nlymphomas; other sites being small and large bowel indecreasing order of frequency. Prognosis of primary gastriclymphoma is better than for intestinal lymphomas. Primarylymphoma of stomach is the most common malignant gastrictumour (4%) next to carcinoma.\\nClinical manifestations of gastric lymphomas may be\\nsimilar to gastric carcinoma. Age incidence for lymphomasof the gastrointestinal tract is usually lower than that forcarcinoma (30-40 years as compared to 40-60 years in gastriccarcinoma) and may occur even in childhood. Relationshipwith long-standing chronic H. pylori  gastritis with lymphoid\\nhyperplasia has been strongly suggested.\\nGrossly,  gastric lymphomas have 2 types of appearances:\\n1.Diffusely infiltrating type,  producing thickening of the\\naffected gut wall, obliteration of mucosal folds andFigure 20.18 contd... Gastric carcinoma, gross appearance of subtypes and their corresponding dominant histological patterns.\\n560SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nulcerations. Cut section shows lesions in the mucosa and\\nsubmucosa but in late stage whole thickness of the gutwall may be affected.\\n2.Polypoid type,  which produces large protruding mass\\ninto the lumen with ulcerated surface.\\nLymph node involvement may occur in either of the\\ntwo patterns.\\nMicroscopically,  gastric lymphomas are most often non-\\nHodgkin’s lymphomas of the following types:\\nHigh-grade  large cell immunoblastic lymphoma being\\nthe most common.\\nLow-grade  small lymphocytic well-differentiated B-cell\\nlymphoma referred to as MALToma  is the next in\\nfrequency (arising from  Mucosa Associated LymphoidTissue). The term pseudolymphoma is sometimes used for\\nnon-invasive stage of MALToma.\\nSMALL INTESTINE\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nAnatomically, the small bowel having a length of 550-650\\ncm, includes the duodenum, jejunum and ileum and tendsto become narrower throughout its course.\\nHistologically,  the small bowel is identified by recognition\\nof villi. The wall of the small intestine consists of 4 layers:\\n1. The serosa  is the outer covering of the small bowel which\\nis complete except over a part of the duodenum.Figure 20.19 A, Ulcerative carcinoma stomach . The luminal surface of the stomach in the region of pyloric canal shows an elevated irregular\\ngrowth with ulcerated surface and raised margins. B, Malignant cells forming irregular glands with stratification are seen invading the layers of the\\nstomach wall. C, Linitis plastica . The wall of the stomach in the region of pyloric canal is markedly thickened and fibrotic while the mucosal folds are\\nlost. D, Microscopy shows characteristic signet ring tumour cells having abundant  mucinous cytoplasm positive for mucicarmine (inbox). The\\nstroma is desmoplastic.\\n561CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tract2. The  muscularis propria  is composed of 2 layers of smooth\\nmuscle tissue—outer thinner longitudinal and inner thicker\\ncircular layer. These muscles are functionally important for\\nperistalsis. Between the two layers of muscle lie ganglionatedplexus, myenteric plexus of Auerbach.\\n3. The  submucosa  is composed of loose fibrous tissue with\\nblood vessels and lacteals in it. It contains a gangliated\\nplexus, Meissner’s plexus, having fewer and smaller cells\\nthan the Auerbach’s plexus.\\n4. The  mucosa  consists of glandular epithelium overlying\\nthe lamina propria composed of loose connective tissue and\\ncontains phagocytic cells and abundance of lymphoid cells(Peyer’s patches in the ileum) and plasma cells. It issupported externally by thin layer of smooth muscle fibres,\\nmuscularis mucosae.  The mucous membrane is thrown into\\nfolds or plicae  which are more in the jejunum and less in the\\nileum, thus increasing the absorptive surface enormously.\\nThe absorptive surface is further increased by the intestinal\\nvilli. Villi are finger-like or leaf-like projections which contain\\n3 types of cells:\\ni)Simple columnar cells . They perform absorptive function\\ndue to the presence of brush border consisting of large\\nnumber of microvilli.\\nii)Goblet cells.   These are mucus-secreting cells and are\\ninterspersed between the columnar cells.iii)Endocrine cells.  These are scattered in the villi as well as\\nare widely distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.These cells have various synonyms as under:\\nKulchitsky cells,  after the name of its discoverer.\\nEnterochromaffin cells,  due to their resemblance to\\nchromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.\\nArgentaffin cells,  as the intracytoplasmic granules stain\\npositively with silver salts by reduction reaction (argyrophilcells, on the other hand, require the addition of exogenous\\nreducing substance for staining).\\nEndocrine cells,  as these specialised cells are considered\\nto be part of APUD cell system (having common properties\\nas Amine content, amine Precursor Uptake and Decarboxy-\\nlation). APUD cells are considered to be endodermal in origin,while previously they were thought to be neural crestderivative. Other endocrine cells belonging to the APUD cellsystem are C-cells of the thyroid, chromaffin cells of the\\nadrenal medulla, certain cells of the carotid body, bronchi,\\nhypothalamus, pituitary and sympathetic ganglia.\\nEndocrine cells are heavily populated in the proximal\\nsmall bowel as this is the most active site for absorption and\\nsecretory activities. They are sparse in the colon which is\\nless active site for such functions.\\nThe duodenum contains distinctively branched Brunner’s\\nglands  present in the submucosa and going up to muscularis\\nmucosae. The deeper layer of the mucosa of the smallintestine elsewhere contains intestinal glands or crypts of\\nLieberkuhn.  They are lined by columnar cells, goblet cells,\\nendocrine cells and Paneth cells. Paneth cells are normally\\nexclusively found in the small intestine and occasionally in\\nthe caecum. These cells are characterised by the presence ofsupranuclear granules rich in lysozyme.The blood supply of the whole of small intestine, except\\nthe first part of the duodenum, is by the superior mesenteric\\nartery which supplies blood by mesenteric arterial arcadesand the straight arteries.\\nThe main  functions  of the small intestine are digestion\\nand absorption so that ultimately nutrients passing into thebloodstream are utilised by the cells in metabolism. Themucosal layer of the small intestine has remarkable capacityfor regeneration and new lining is laid every 3-4 days.\\nCONGENITAL ANOMALIES\\nIntestinal Atresia and Stenosis\\nIntestinal atresia  is congenital absence of lumen, most\\ncommonly affecting the ileum or duodenum. The proximal\\nsegment has a blind end which is separated from distalsegment freely, or the two segments are joined by a fibrouscord. The condition must be recognised early and treatedsurgically, as otherwise it is incompatible with life.\\nIntestinal stenosis  is congenital narrowing of the lumen\\naffecting a segment of the small intestine. Intestinal segmentabove the level of obstruction is dilated and that below it iscollapsed.\\nMeckel’s Diverticulum\\nMeckel’s diverticulum is the most common congenital\\nanomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring in 2% ofpopulation. It is more common in males. The anomaly iscommonly situated on the antimesenteric border of the ileum,about 1 meter above the ileocaecal valve. Like other truediverticula, Meckel’s diverticulum is an outpouchingcontaining all the layers of the intestinal wall in their normalorientation (Fig. 20.20) . It is almost always lined by small\\nintestinal type of epithelium; rarely it may contain islands ofgastric mucosa and ectopic pancreatic tissue. Embryologicorigin of Meckel’s diverticulum is from incompleteobliteration of vitellointestinal duct. (Other anomaliesresulting from the remnants of vitellointestinal duct arevitelline sinus and vitelline cyst).\\nThe common complications  of Meckel’s diverticulum are\\nperforation, haemorrhage and diverticulitis.\\nIn addition to congenital Meckel’s diverticulum, acquired\\ndiverticula  also occur in the small intestine. These are\\ncommonly multiple (diverticulosis), frequently located on themesenteric border, and are sometimes associated withmalabsorption.\\nIntestinal Malrotation\\nMalrotation is a developmental abnormality of the midgut\\n(i.e. the portion of intestine between the duodenojejunalflexure and the middle of transverse colon). Due to failure ofnormal rotation of midgut, the following consequences canoccur:i)Exomphalos i.e. intestinal eventration at the umbilicus.\\nii\\n) Misplacement of the caecum, appendix and ascending\\ncolon.iii) Mobile caecum.562SECTION III Systemic PathologyINTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION\\nConditions which interfere with the propulsion of contents\\nin the intestine are considered under the heading of intestinalobstruction. The causes of intestinal obstruction can beclassified under the following 3 broad groups:\\n1. Mechanical obstruction.  It can occur as a result of the\\nfollowing causes:\\ni)Internal obstruction (intramural and intraluminal):\\nInflammatory strictures (e.g. Crohn’s disease)\\nCongenital stenosis, atresia, imperforate anus\\nTumours\\nMeconium in mucoviscidosis\\nRoundworms\\nGallstones, faecoliths, foreign bodies\\nUlceration induced by potassium chloride tablets\\nprescribed to counter hypokalaemia.\\nii)External compression :\\nPeritoneal adhesions and bands\\nStrangulated hernias\\nIntussusception\\nVolvulus\\nIntra-abdominal tumour.\\n2. Neurogenic obstruction. It occurs due to paralytic ileus\\ni.e. paralysis of muscularis of the intestine as a result of shock\\nafter abdominal operation or by acute peritonitis.\\n3. Vascular obstruction.  Obstruction of the superior mesen-\\nteric artery or its branches may result in infarction causing\\nparalysis. The causes are as under:\\nThrombosis\\nEmbolism\\nAccidental ligation.Out of the various causes listed above, conditions\\nproducing external compression on the bowel wall are themost common causes of intestinal obstruction (80%). Someof these are described below.Peritoneal Adhesions and Bands\\nAdhesions and bands in the peritoneum composed of fibrous\\ntissue result following healing in peritonitis. Rarely, suchfibrous adhesions and bands may be without any precedingperitoneal inflammation and are of congenital origin. In eithercase, peritoneal bands and adhesions result in partial orcomplete intestinal obstruction by outside pressure on thebowel wall.\\nHernias\\nHernia is protrusion of portion of a viscus through an\\nabnormal opening in the wall of its natural cavity.\\nExternal hernia  is the protrusion of the bowel through a\\ndefect or weakness in the peritoneum.\\nInternal hernia  is the term applied for herniation that\\ndoes not present on the external surface.\\nTwo major factors involved in the formation of a hernia\\nare as under:\\ni)Local weakness  which may be congenital e.g. at the\\numbilicus, inguinal and femoral canals, and in surgical scars\\ncalled ‘incisional hernia’.\\nii)Increased intra-abdominal pressure  that is produced by\\ncoughing, straining and exertion.\\nInguinal hernias are more common, followed in\\ndecreasing frequency, by femoral and umbilical hernias.\\nInguinal hernias may be of 2 types:\\nDirect  when hernia passes medial to the inferior\\nepigastric artery and it appears through the externalabdominal ring.\\nIndirect  when it follows the inguinal canal lateral to the\\ninferior epigastric artery.\\nWhen the contents of hernia such as loop of intestine can\\nbe returned to the abdominal cavity, it is called reducible.\\nWhen it is not possible to reduce hernia due to large contentsor due to adhesions in the hernial sac, it is referred to asirreducible.\\nFigure 20.20 Meckel’s diverticulum. A, Common location and gross appearance. B, Resected segment of the small intestine shows an\\noutpouching which on section is seen communicating with the intestinal lumen. The lumen contains necrotic debris.\\n563CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal TractWhen the blood flow in the hernial sac is obstructed, it\\nresults in strangulated hernia. Obstruction to the venous\\ndrainage and arterial supply may result in infarction or\\ngangrene of the affected loop of intestine. The gross andmicroscopic appearance of strangulated intestine is the sameas that of infarction of intestine.\\nIntussusception\\nIntussusception is the telescoping of a segment of intestine\\ninto the segment below due to peristalsis. The telescopedsegment is called the intussusceptum  and lower receiving\\nsegment is called the intussuscipiens.  The condition occurs\\nmore commonly in infants and young children, more oftenin the ileocaecal region when the portion of ileum invaginatesinto the ascending colon without affecting the position ofthe ileocaecal valve (Fig. 20.21) . Less common forms are ileo-\\nileal and colo-colic intussusception.\\nIn children, the cause is usually not known though\\nenlargement of the lymphoid tissue in the terminal ileumhas been suggested by some. In the case of adults, the usualcauses are foreign bodies and tumours.\\nThe main complications  of intussusception are intestinal\\nobstruction, infarction, gangrene, perforation and peritonitis.\\nVolvulus\\nVolvulus is the twisting of loop of intestine upon itself\\nthrough 180° or more. This leads to obstruction of theintestine as well as cutting off of the blood supply to theaffected loop. The usual causes are bands and adhesions(congenital or acquired) and long mesenteric attachment. Thecondition is more common in the sigmoid colon than thesmall bowel.\\nISCHAEMIC BOWEL DISEASE\\n(ISCHAEMIC ENTEROCOLITIS)\\nIschaemic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract may occur in\\nthe small intestine and/or colon; the latter is called ischaemic\\ncolitis or ischaemic enterocolitis  and is commonly referred toas ischaemic bowel disease. In either case, the cause ofischaemia is compromised mesenteric circulation, whileischaemic effect is less likely to occur in the stomach,duodenum and rectum due to abundant collateral bloodsupply.\\nDepending upon the extent and severity of ischaemia, 3\\npatterns of pathologic lesions can occur (Fig. 20.22) :\\n1.Transmural infarction,  characterised by full thickness\\ninvolvement i.e. transmural ischaemic necrosis and gangreneof the bowel.\\n2Mural infarction,  characterised by haemorrhagic gastro-\\nenteropathy (haemorrhage and necrosis). The ischaemic\\neffect in mural infarction is limited to mucosa, submucosaand superficial muscularis, while mucosal infarction  is\\nconfined to mucosal layers superficial to muscularismucosae.\\n3.Ischaemic colitis,  due to chronic colonic ischaemia causing\\nfibrotic narrowing of the affected bowel.\\nThese pathologic patterns are described below:\\nTransmural Infarction\\nIschaemic necrosis of the full-thickness of the bowel wall is\\nmore common in the small intestine than the large intestine.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The common causes of transmural\\ninfarction of small bowel are as under:\\ni)Mesenteric arterial thrombosis  such as due to the following:\\nAtherosclerosis (most common)\\nAortic aneurysm\\nVasospasm\\nFibromuscular hyperplasia\\nInvasion by the tumour\\nUse of oral contraceptives\\nArteritis of various types\\nii)Mesenteric arterial embolism  arising from the following\\ncauses:\\nMural thrombi in the heart\\nEndocarditis (infective and nonbacterial thrombotic)\\nAtherosclerotic plaques\\nAtrial myxoma\\niii)Mesenteric venous occlusion  is less common cause of full-\\nthickness infarction of the bowel. The causes are as under:Figure 20.21 Ileocaecal intussusception.\\nFigure 20.22 Schematic diagram to show the three types of\\nischaemic bowel disease depending upon the extent of involvement.\\n564SECTION III Systemic PathologyIntestinal sepsis e.g. appendicitis\\nPortal venous thrombosis in cirrhosis of the liver\\nTumour invasion\\nUse of oral contraceptives\\niv)Miscellaneous causes :\\nStrangulated hernia\\nTorsion\\nFibrous bands and adhesions.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  irrespective of\\nthe underlying etiology, infarction of the bowel is\\nhaemorrhagic (red) type (page 126). A varying length ofthe small bowel may be affected. In the case of colonicinfarction, the distribution area of superior and inferiormesenteric arteries (i.e. splenic flexure)  is more commonly\\ninvolved. The affected areas become dark purple andmarkedly congested and the peritoneal surface is coatedwith fibrinous exudate. The wall is thickened, oedematousand haemorrhagic. The lumen is dilated and containsblood and mucus. In arterial occlusion, there is sharp lineof demarcation between the infarcted bowel and thenormal intestine,  whereas in venous occlusion the\\ninfarcted area merges imperceptibly into the normal bowel(Fig. 20.23) .\\nMicroscopically,  there is coagulative necrosis and ulcera-\\ntion of the mucosa and there are extensive submucosalhaemorrhages. The muscularis is less severely affected byischaemia. Subsequently, inflammatory cell infiltrationand secondary infection occur, leading to gangrene of thebowel (Fig. 20.24) .\\nThe condition is clinically characterised by ‘abdominal\\nangina’ in which the patient has acute abdominal pain,nausea, vomiting, and sometimes diarrhoea. The disease israpidly fatal, with 50-70% mortality rate.Mural and Mucosal Infarction (HaemorrhagicGastroenterop athy, Membranous Colitis)\\nMural and mucosal infarctions are limited to superficiallayers of the bowel wall, sparing the deeper layer of themuscularis and the serosa. The condition is also referred toas haemorrhagic gastroenteropathy,  and in the case of colon as\\nmembranous colitis.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Haemorrhagic gastroenteropathy\\nresults from conditions causing non-occlusive hypoperfusion\\n(compared from transmural infarction which occurs fromocclusive causes). These are as under:\\nShock\\nCardiac failure\\nInfections\\nIntake of drugs causing vasoconstriction e.g. digitalis,\\nnorepinephrine.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the lesions affect\\nvariable length of the bowel. The affected segment of thebowel is red or purple but without haemorrhage andexudation on the serosal surface. The mucosa isoedematous at places, sloughed and ulcerated at otherplaces. The lumen contains haemorrhagic fluid.Microscopically,  there is patchy ischaemic necrosis of\\nmucosa, vascular congestion, haemorrhages andinflammatory cell infiltrate. The changes may extend intosuperficial muscularis but deeper layer of muscularis andserosa are spared. Secondary bacterial infection maysupervene resulting in pseudomembranous enterocolitis.\\nClinically, as in transmural infarction, the features of\\nabdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are present,but the changes are reversible and curable. With adequate\\nFigure 20.23 Haemorrhagic infarct of the small intestine. The\\ninfarcted area is swollen, dark in colour and coated with fibrinous exudate.\\nA sharp line of demarcation separates infarcted area from the normalbowel (arrow).Figure 20.24\\nInfarct small intestine, microscopic appearance. The\\nmucosa in the infarcted area shows coagulative necrosis and submucosalhaemorrhages: muscularis is also partly affected. Inflammatory cellinfiltration is marked at the line of demarcation between the infarctedand normal bowel.\\n565CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tracttherapy, normal morphology is completely restored in\\nsuperficial lesions, while deeper lesions may heal by fibrosisleading to stricture formation.\\nIschaemic Colitis\\nAlthough this condition affects primarily colon in the region\\nof splenic flexure, it is described here due to its apparentpathogenetic relationship with ischaemic injury. Ischaemiccolitis is characterised by chronic segmental colonicischaemia followed by chronic inflammation and healing byfibrosis and scarring causing obstruction (ischaemicstricture).\\nGrossly,  most frequently affected site is the splenic flexure;\\nother site is rectum. Ischaemic colitis passes through 3stages: infarct, transient ischaemia and ischaemic stricture.However, the surgical submitted specimens generally areof the ischaemic stricture. External surface of the affectedarea is fusiform or saccular. On cut section, there arepatchy, segmental and longitudinal mucosal ulcers. Thus,the gross appearance can be confused with either of thetwo types of inflammatory bowel disease.Microscopically,  the ulcerated areas of the mucosa show\\ngranulation tissue. The submucosa is characteristicallythickened due to inflammation and fibrosis. Themuscularis may also show inflammatory changes andpatchy replacement by fibrosis. The blood vessels mayshow atheromatous emboli, organising thrombi andendarteritis obliterans.\\nNECROTISING ENTEROCOLITIS\\nNecrotising enterocolitis is an acute inflammation of the\\nterminal ileum and ascending colon, occurring primarily inpremature and low-birth-weight infants within the first weekof life and less commonly in full-term infants.\\nETIOLOGY.  The condition has been considered as a variant\\nof the spectrum of ischaemic bowel disease. Important factors\\nin the etiology of this disorder, thus, are as follows:1.Ischaemia\\n2.Hypoxia/anoxia of the bowel due to bypassing of blood\\nfrom the affected area3.\\nBacterial infection and endotoxins\\n4. Establishment of feeding5. Infants fed on commercial formulae than breast-fed,implying the role of immunoprotective factors.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the affected\\nsegment of the bowel is dilated, necrotic, haemorrhagicand friable. Bowel wall may contain bubbles of air(pneumatosis intestinalis).Microscopically,  the changes are variable depending upon\\nthe stage. Initial changes are confined to mucosa and showoedema, haemorrhage and coagulative necrosis. Apseudomembrane  composed of necrotic epithelium, fibrin\\nand inflammatory cells may develop. As the ischaemicprocess extends to the subjacent layers, muscle layer isalso involved and may lead to perforation and peritonitis.In healed cases, stricture formation, malabsorption and\\nshort bowel syndrome are the usual complications.\\nINFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE\\n(CROHN’S DISEASE AND ULCERA TIVE COLITIS)\\nDEFINITION.  The term ‘inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)’\\nis commonly used to include 2 idiopathic bowel diseaseshaving many similarities but the conditions usually havedistinctive morphological appearance. These 2 conditions areCrohn’s disease (regional enteritis) and ulcerative colitis:\\n1.\\nCrohn’s disease or Regional enteritis  is an idiopathic\\nchronic ulcerative IBD, characterised by transmural, non-\\ncaseating granulomatous inflammation, affecting mostcommonly the segment of terminal ileum and/or colon,though any part of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved.\\n2.\\nUlcerative colitis  is an idiopathic form of acute and\\nchronic ulcero-inflammatory colitis affecting chiefly the\\nmucosa and submucosa of the rectum and descending colon,though sometimes it may involve the entire length of thelarge bowel.\\nBoth these disorders primarily affect the bowel but may\\nhave systemic involvement in the form of polyarthritis,uveitis, ankylosing spondylitis, skin lesions and hepaticinvolvement. Both diseases can occur at any age but are morefrequent in 2nd and 3rd decades of life. Females are affectedslightly more often.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The exact etiology of IBD remains\\nunknown. However, multiple factors are implicated which\\ncan be considered under the following 3 groups:\\n1.Genetic factors. Genetic factors are implicated in the\\netiopathogenesis of IBD is supported by the following\\nevidences:i) There is about 3 to 20 times higher incidence of occurrenceof IBD in first-degree relatives. This is due to genetic defectcausing diminished epithelial barrier function.ii) Overall, there is approximately 50% chance of develop-ment of IBD (Crohn’s disease about 60% concordance,ulcerative colitis about 6% concordance) in monozygotictwins.iii) Although no specific and consistent gene association withIBD has been seen, genome wide search has revealed thatdisease-predisposing loci are present in chromosomes 16q,12p, 6p, 14q and 5q. In particular, CARD15 (caspase-\\nassociated recruitment domain containing protein 15) on\\nchromosome 16q is expressed by several cells in the intestinalmocosa which in mutated form results in loss of its functionand renders an individual about 50-times higher risk todevelop Crohn’s disease.iv) HLA studies show that ulcerative colitis is more commonin HLA-DRB1-alleles while Crohn’s disease is more commonin HLA-DR7 and DQ4 alleles.\\n2. Immunologic factors.  Defective immunologic regulation\\nin IBD has been shown to play significant role in the\\npathogenesis of IBD:\\ni) Defective regulation of immune suppression.  In a normal\\nindividual, there is lack of immune responsiveness to dietary566SECTION III Systemic Pathologyantigens and commensal flora in the intestinal lumen. The\\nmechanism responsible for this is by activation of CD4+ T\\ncells secreting cytokines inhibitory to inflammation (IL-10,\\nTGF- β) which suppress inflammation in the gut wall. In IBD,\\nthis immune mechanism of suppression of inflammation isdefective and thus results in uncontrolled inflammation.\\nii) Transgenic mouse experimental model studies.  Gene ‘knock\\nout’ studies on colitis in mice have revealed that multiple\\nimmune abnormalities may be responsible for IBD as under:\\na) Deletion of inflammation inhibitory cytokines (e.g. IL-2,\\nIL-10, TGF- β) or their receptors.\\nb) Deletion of molecules responsible for T cell recognition(e.g. T cell antigen receptors, MHC class II).\\nc) Interference with normal epithelial barrier function in the\\nintestine (e.g. blocking N-cadherin, deletion of multi-drug\\nresistance MDR gene).\\niii) Type of inflammatory cells.  In both types of IBD, activated\\nCD4+ T cells are present in the lamina propria and in theperipheral blood. These cells either activate other\\ninflammatory cells (e.g. macrophages and B cells), or recruitmore inflammatory cells by stimulation of homing receptoron leucocytes and vascular endothelium. There are two maintypes of CD4+ T cells in IBD:\\n TH1 cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines IFN- γ and\\nTNF which induce transmural granulomatous inflammationseen in Crohn’s disease. IL-12 initiates TH1 cytokinepathway.\\n TH2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 which induce\\nsuperficial mucosal inflammation characteristically seen inulcerative colitis.\\n3. Exogenous factors.  In addition to role of genetic factors\\nand deranged T-cell mediated immunity, a role for several\\nexogenous and environmental factors has been assigned:i) Microbial factors:  At different times, role of a variety of\\nmicrobes in initiation of inflammatory response by the bodyhas been suspected. Accordingly, several microorganismspecies (bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi) have been\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 20.6: Distinguishing Features of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.\\nFeature Crohn’s Disease Ulcerative Colitis\\nA.

The morphologic features\\nof Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are sufficientlydistinctive so as to be classified separately. These featuresare presented below; the distinguishing features of thetwo conditions are summarised in Table 20.6.\\nCROHN’S DISEASE.  Crohn’s disease may involve any\\nportion of the gastrointestinal tract but affects mostcommonly 15-25 cm of the terminal ileum which may extendinto the caecum and sometimes into the ascending colon:\\nGrossly,  characteristic feature is the multiple, well-\\ndemarcated segmental bowel involvement withintervening uninvolved ‘skip areas’. The wall of theaffected bowel segment is thick and hard, resembling a‘hose pipe’ . Serosa may be studded with minute granu-\\nlomas. The lumen of the affected segment is markedlynarrowed. The mucosa shows ‘serpiginous ulcers’, whileintervening surviving mucosa is swollen giving‘cobblestone appearance’. There may be deep fissuringinto the bowel wall (Fig. 20.25) .\\nHistologically,  the characteristic features are as follows\\n(Fig. 20.26) :\\n1.Transmural inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting  of\\nchronic inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells andmacrophages) is the classical microscopic feature.2.Non-caseating, sarcoid-like granulomas  are present in all\\nthe layers of the affected bowel wall in 60% of cases andmay even be seen in the regional lymph nodes.3. There is patchy ulceration  of the mucosa which may take\\nthe form of deep fissures, accompanied by inflammatoryinfiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells.4.There is widening of the submucosa  due to oedema and\\nfoci of lymphoid aggregates.5.\\nIn more chronic cases,  fibrosis becomes increasingly\\nprominent in all the layers disrupting muscular layer.\\nULCERATIVE COLITIS.  Classically, ulcerative colitis\\nbegins in the rectum, and in continuity extends upwards intothe sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, andsometimes may involve the entire colon. The colonic contents\\nFigure 20.25 Crohn’s disease of the terminal ileum. A, The lesions\\nare characteristically segmental with intervening uninvolved ‘skip areas’.\\nThe bowel wall is thickened and the lumen narrowed, giving hose-pipeappearance. Serpiginous ulcers, some deep fissures and swollenintervening surviving mucosa giving ‘cobblestone appearance’, are present.B, The specimen of small intestine is shown in longitudinal section alongwith a segment in cross section. External surface shows increasedmesenteric fat, thickened wall and narrow lumen. Luminal surface oflongitudinal cut section shows segment of thickened wall with narrow lumenwhich is better appreciated in cross section (arrow) while intervening areas\\nof the bowel are uninvolved or skipped.\\n568SECTION III Systemic Pathologymay rarely backflow into the terminal ileum in continuity,\\ncausing ‘back-wash ileitis’  in about 10% of cases.\\nGrossly,  the characteristic feature is the continuous\\ninvolvement of the rectum and colon without any uninvol-ved skip areas compared to Crohn’s disease. Theappearance of colon may vary depending upon the stageand intensity of the disease because of remissions andexacerbations. Mucosa shows linear and superficial ulcers,usually not penetrating the muscular layer. Theintervening intact mucosa may form inflammatory‘pseudopolyps.’ The muscle layer is thickened due tocontraction, producing shortening and narrowing of theaffected colon with loss of normal haustral folds giving‘garden-hose appearance’  (Fig. 20.27) .\\nHistologically,  ulcerative colitis because of remission and\\nexacerbations, is characterised by alternating ‘activedisease process’ and ‘resolving colitis.’ The changes in the‘active disease process’ are as under (Fig. 20.28) :\\n1.Crypt distortion,  cryptitis  and focal accumulations of\\nneutrophils forming crypt abscesses.\\n2.Marked congestion, dilatation and haemorrhages  from\\nmucosal capillaries.3.Superficial mucosal ulcerations,  usually not penetrating\\ninto the muscle coat, except in severe cases, and isaccompanied by nonspecific inflammatory cell infiltrate\\nFigure 20.26 Crohn’s disease of the ileum. The histological features present are: transmural chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, deep fi ssures\\ninto the bowel wall, submucosal widening due to oedema, some prominent lymphoid follicles and a few non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas\\nin the bowel wall.\\nFigure 20.27 Ulcerative colitis.

Areas of mucosal regeneration and mucodepletion  of lin-\\ning cells.6. In long-standing cases, epithelial cytologic atypia\\nranging from mild to marked dysplasia and sometimesdeveloping into carcinoma in situ  and frank adeno-\\ncarcinoma.\\nCOMPLICATIONS. Complications  of Crohn’s disease and\\nulcerative colitis are as under:\\nCrohn’s disease:\\n1.Malabsorption  due to impaired absorption of fat, vitamin\\nB\\n12, proteins and electrolytes from the diseased small bowel.\\n2.Fistula formation  may occur in long-standing cases. These\\nmay be internal fistulae between the loops of the intestine,\\nor external fistulae such as enterocutaneous, rectal and analfistulae.\\n3.Stricture formation  may occur in chronic cases due to\\nextensive fibrosis in the affected bowel wall.4.Development of malignancy in the small intestine as a late\\ncomplication of Crohn’s disease is rarer than that in ulcerative\\ncolitis, but lymphoma may develop more often in Crohn’sdisease than adenocarcinoma (seen in some long-standingcases of ulcerative colitis).\\nUlcerative colitis:\\n1.Toxic megacolon (Fulminant colitis)  is the acute fulminating\\ncolitis in which the affected colon is thin-walled and dilated\\nand is prone to perforation and faecal peritonitis. There isdeep penetration of the inflammatory cell infiltrate intomuscle layer which is disrupted.2.Perianal fistula  formation may occur rarely.\\n3.Carcinoma  may develop in long-standing cases of\\nulcerative colitis of more than 10 years duration.\\n4.Stricture formation  almost never occurs in ulcerative colitis.\\nOTHER INFLAMMATORY LESIONS OF THE BOWEL\\nBesides IBD, a variety of other acute and chronic inflam-\\nmatory conditions affect small bowel (enteritis), large bowel(colitis), or both (enterocolitis); the last named being morecommon. Hence, all these conditions involving small boweland/or large bowel are described together here for bettercorrelation of features.\\nThe various forms of inflammations of the bowel after\\nexcluding IBD can be categorised broadly into ‘infective\\nenterocolitis’  and ‘pseudomembranous enterocolitis.’\\nINFECTIVE ENTEROCOLITIS\\nThese are a group of acute and chronic inflammatory lesions\\nof small intestine and/or colon caused by microorganisms(bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and helminths). All theseare characterised by diarrhoeal syndromes. Pathogeneticallyspeaking, these microorganisms can cause enterocolitis by 2mechanisms—by enteroinvasive bacteria  producing ulcerative\\nlesions, and by enterotoxin-producing bacteria  resulting in non-\\nulcerative lesions.\\nA list of common microorganisms producing enterocolitis\\nis presented in Table 20.7.  A few important forms are\\ndescribed below.\\nIntestinal Tuberculosis\\nIntestinal tuberculosis can occur in 3 forms—primary,\\nsecondary and hyperplastic caecal tuberculosis.\\n1. PRIMARY INTESTINAL TUBERCULOSIS.  Though an\\nuncommon disease in the developed countries of the world,Figure 20.28 Ulcerative colitis in active phase. The microscopic features seen are superficial ulcerations, with mucosal infiltration by inf lammatory\\ncells and a ‘crypt abscess’.\\n570SECTION III Systemic Pathologyprimary tuberculosis of the ileocaecal region is quite common\\nin developing countries including India. In the pre-pasteurisation era, it used to occur by ingestion of unpas-teurised cow’s milk infected with Mycobacterium bovis.  But\\nnow-a-days due to control of tuberculosis in cattle andpasteurisation of milk, virtually all cases of intestinaltuberculosis are caused by M. tuberculosis.  The predominant\\nchanges are in the mesenteric lymph nodes without anysignificant intestinal lesion.\\nGrossly,  the affected lymph nodes are enlarged, matted\\nand caseous (tabes mesenterica). Eventually, there ishealing by fibrosis and calcification (Fig. 20.29,A) .Microscopically,  in the initial stage, there is primary\\ncomplex or Ghon’s focus in the intestinal mucosa as occurselsewhere in primary tuberculous infection (page 153).Subsequently, the mesenteric lymph nodes are affectedwhich show typical tuberculous granulomatousinflammatory reaction with caseation necrosis.Tuberculous peritonitis may occur due to spread of theinfection.\\n2. SECONDARY INTESTINAL TUBERCULOSIS.  Self-\\nswallowing of sputum in patients with active pulmonarytuberculosis may cause secondary intestinal tuberculosis,most commonly in the terminal ileum and rarely in the colon.\\nGrossly,  the intestinal lesions are prominent than the\\nlesions in regional lymph nodes as in secondary\\npulmonary tuberculosis (Fig. 20.29,B) . The lesions begin\\nin the Peyer’s patches or the lymphoid follicles withformation of small ulcers that spread through thelymphatics to form large ulcers which are transverse  to the\\nlong axis of the bowel,  (c.f. typhoid ulcers of small intestine,\\ndescribed below). These ulcers may be coated with caseousmaterial. Serosa may be studded with visible tubercles.In advanced cases, transverse fibrous strictures andintestinal obstruction are seen (Fig. 20.30,A, B) .\\nHistologically,  the tuberculous lesions in the intestine are\\nsimilar to those observed elsewhere i.e. presence oftubercles. Mucosa and submucosa show ulceration andthe muscularis may be replaced by variable degree offibrosis (Fig. 20.30,C) . Tuberculous peritonitis may be\\nobserved.\\n3.\\nHYPERPLASTIC CAECAL TUBERCULOSIS.  This is a\\nvariant of occurring secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis.\\nGrossly,  the caecum and/or ascending colon are thick-\\nwalled with mucosal ulceration. Clinically, the lesion ispalpabl e and may be mistaken for carcinoma\\n(Fig. 20.29,C) .\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 20.7: Micro-organisms Causing Infective\\nEnterocolitis.\\nA. BACTERIAL ENTEROCOLITIS\\n1.

Besides, bacteriologicalevidence by culture or animal inoculation and Mantouxtest are helpful in differential diagnosis of the twoconditions.\\nEnteric Fever\\nThe term enteric fever is used to describe acute infection\\ncaused by Salmonella typhi  (typhoid fever) or Salmonella\\nparatyphi  (paratyphoid fever). Besides these 2 salmonellae,\\nSalmonella typhimurium  causes food poisoning.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The typhoid bacilli are ingested through\\ncontaminated food or water. During the initial asymptomaticincubation period of about 2 weeks, the bacilli invade thelymphoid follicles and Peyer’s patches of the small intestineand proliferate. Following this, the bacilli invade the blood-stream causing bacteraemia, and the characteristic clinicalfeatures of the disease like continuous rise in temperatureand ‘rose spots’ on the skin are observed. Immunologicalreactions (Widal’s test) begin after about 10 days and peaktitres are seen by the end of the third week. Eventually, thebacilli are localised in the intestinal lymphoid tissue(producing typhoid intestinal lesions), in the mesentericlymph nodes (leading to haemorrhagic lymphadenitis), inthe liver (causing foci of parenchymal necrosis), in the gallbladder (producing typhoid cholecystitis), and in the spleen(resulting in splenic reactive hyperplasia).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The lesions are observed\\nin the intestines as well as in other organs.\\n1.INTESTINAL LESIONS. Grossly,  terminal ileum is\\naffected most often, but lesions may be seen in the jejunumand colon. Peyer’s patches show oval typhoid ulcers with\\ntheir long axis along the length of the bowel, (c.f. tuberculous\\nulcers of small intestine, described above). The base ofthe ulcers is black due to sloughed mucosa. The marginsof the ulcers are slightly raised due to inflammatoryoedema and cellular proliferation. There is never signifi-cant fibrosis and hence fibrous stenosis seldom occurs inhealed typhoid lesions. The regional lymph nodes areinvariably enlarged (Fig. 20.31,A) .\\nMicroscopically,  there is hyperaemia, oedema and cellular\\nproliferation consisting of phagocytic histiocytes (showingcharacteristic erythrophagocytosis), lymphocytes andplasma cells. Though enteric fever is an example of acuteinflammation, neutrophils are invariably absent from thecellular infiltrate and this is reflected in the leucopeniawith neutropenia and relative lymphocytosis in theperipheral blood (Fig. 20.31,B) .\\nThe main  complications  of the intestinal lesions of\\ntyphoid are perforation of the ulcers and haemorrhage.\\n2.OTHER LESIONS.  Besides the intestinal involvement,\\nvarious other organs and tissues showing pathological\\nchanges in enteric fever are as under:\\ni)Mesenteric lymph nodes —haemorrhagic lymph-\\nadenitis.\\nii)Liver —foci of parenchymal necrosis.\\niii)Gallbladder —typhoid cholecystitis.\\niv)Spleen —splenomegaly with reactive hyperplasia.\\nv)Kidneys —nephritis.\\nvi)Abdominal muscles —Zenker’s degeneration.\\nvii) Joints —arthritis.\\nviii) Bones —osteitis.\\nix)Meninges —Meningitis.\\nx)Testis —Orchitis.\\nFigure 20.30 Intestinal tuberculosis. A, The external surface of small intestine shows stricture and a lymph node in section having caseatio n\\nnecrosis (arrows). B, The lumen shows characteristic transverse ulcers and two strictures (arrow). The wall of intestine in the  area of narrowed\\nlumen is thickened. C, Microscopy of intestine shows caseating epithelioid cell granulomas in the intestinal wall.572SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nPersistence of organism in the gallbladder or urinary tract\\nmay result in passage of organisms in the faeces or urine\\ncreating a ‘carrier state’ which is a source of infection toothers.\\nBacterial Food Poisoning\\nThis is a form of acute bacterial illness that occurs following\\ningestion of food or water contaminated with bacteria otherthan those that cause specific acute intestinal infections liketyphoid, paratyphoid, cholera or dysentery bacilli. The illnessresults from either bacterial invasion or bacterial toxigeniceffect on the bowel.\\nThe commonest causes of bacterial food poisoning\\nresulting in enteritis or enterocolitis are as under:\\n1. Staphylococcal  food poisoning.  Staphylococcus aureus\\ninfection acquired from contaminated food produces either\\nmild food poisoning by enterotoxins, or may cause more severe\\nform of the illness called pseudomembranous enterocolitisdescribed below. Staphylococcal food poisoning occurs dueto liberation of enterotoxins by the bacteria.\\n2. Clostridial food poisoning.  Infection with anaerobic\\norganisms Clostridium welchii,  following consumption of\\ncontaminated meat results in acute food poisoning (page 181).\\nThe illness occurs both by bacterial invasion as well as by\\ntoxins.\\n3. Botulism.  This is a severe form of paralysing illness\\ncaused by ingestion of organism, Clostridium botulinum,\\nwhich produces neurotoxin.4. Salmonella food poisoning (Salmonellosis).  This is an\\ninfection (and not caused by toxins) occurring due to food\\ncontaminated by S. typhimurium  or S. enteritidis.  The condition\\nmanifests with fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Death may\\nresult from depletion of water and electrolytes.\\nDysenteries\\nThe term ‘dysentery’ is used to mean diarrhoea with\\nabdominal cramps, tenesmus and passage of mucus in the\\nstools, from any cause. There are 2 main forms of dysen-teries—bacillary and amoebic.\\n1. BACILLARY DYSENTERY.  Bacillary dysentery is the\\nterm used for infection by shigella  species: S. dysenteriae, S.\\nflexneri, S. boydii and S. sonnei.  Infection occurs by foeco-oral\\nroute and is seen with poor personal hygiene, in densely\\npopulated areas, and with contaminated food and water. The\\ncommon housefly plays a role in spread of infection.\\nGrossly,  the lesions are mainly found in the colon and\\noccasionally in the ileum. Superficial transverseulcerations of mucosa of the bowel wall occur in the region\\nof lymphoid follicles but perforation is seldom seen. The\\nintervening intact mucosa is hyperaemic and oedematous.\\nFollowing recovery from the acute attack, complete\\nhealing usually takes place.Microscopically,  the mucosa overlying the lymphoid\\nfollicles is necrosed. The surrounding mucosa showscongestion, oedema and infiltration by neutrophils and\\nlymphocytes. The mucosa may be covered by greyish-\\nyellow ‘ pseudomembrane’  composed of fibrinosuppurative\\nexudate.\\nThe complications  of bacillary dysentery are haemorrhage,\\nperforation, stenosis, polyarthritis and iridocyclitis.\\n2. AMOEBIC DYSENTERY.  This is due to infection by\\nEntamoeba histolytica.  It is more prevalent in the tropical\\ncountrie s and primarily affects the large intestine. Infection\\noccurs from ingestion of cyst form of the parasite. The cyst\\nwall is dissolved in the small intestine from where theliberated amoebae pass into the large intestine. Here, theyinvade the epithelium of the mucosa, reach the submucosaand produce the characteristic flask-shaped ulcers.\\nGrossly,  early intestinal lesions appear as small areas of\\nelevation on the mucosal surface. In advanced cases,typical flask-shaped ulcers having narrow neck and broadbase are seen. They are more conspicuous in the caecum,rectum and in the flexures  (Fig. 20.32) .\\nFigure 20.31 A, Typhoid ulcers in the small intestine appear\\ncharacteristically oval with their long axis parallel to the long axis of the\\nbowel. B, Blood picture in typhoid fever showing neutropenia and relativelymphocytosis.573CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal TractMicroscopically,  the ulcerated area shows chronic\\ninflammatory reaction consisting of lymphocytes, plasma\\ncells, macrophages and eosinophils. The trophozoites ofEntamoeba  are seen in the inflammatory exudate and are\\nconcentrated at the advancing margin of the lesion.Intestinal amoebae characteristically have ingested redcells in their cytoplasm. Oedema and vascular congestionare present in the area surrounding the ulcers.\\nComplications of intestinal amoebic ulcers are: amoebic\\nliver abscess or amoebic hepatitis, perforation, haemorrhageand formation of amoeboma which is a tumour-like mass.\\nPSEUDOMEMBRANOUS ENTEROCOLITIS\\n(ANTIBIOTIC-ASSOCIA TED DIARRHOEA)\\nPseudomembranous enterocolitis is a form of acuteinflammation of colon and/or small intestine characterisedby formation of ‘ pseudomembrane’  over the site of mucosal\\ninjury.\\nETIOLOGY.  Numerous studies have established the\\novergrowth of Clostridium difficile  with production of its toxin\\nin the etiology of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea culminating\\nin pseudomembranous colitis. Oral antibiotics such asclindamycin, ampicillin and the cephalosporins are moreoften (20%) associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhoea,while development of pseudomembranous colitis may occurin 1-10% cases.\\nPseudomembrane formation may also occur in various\\nother conditions as under:\\nStaphylococcal enterocolitis\\nBacillary (Shigella)  dysentery\\nCandida  enterocolitisMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the lesions may\\nbe confined, to the large intestine or small intestine, orboth may be involved. The mucosa of the bowel is covered\\nby patchy, raised yellow-white plaques. Elsewhere, themucosa is congested and may show small mucosalulcerations.Microscopically,  the ‘ pseudomembrane ’ is composed of\\nnetwork of fibrin and mucus, in which are entangled\\ninflammatory cells and mucosal epithelial cells. There is\\nfocal necrosis of surface epithelial cells. The lamina propriacontains inflammatory cell infiltrate, mainly neutrophils.The submucosa has congested capillaries and may showmicrothrombi. The inflammation spreads laterally ratherthan deeply.\\nMALABSORPTION SYNDROME\\nDEFINITION AND CLASSIFICA TION\\nThe malabsorption syndrome (MAS) is characterised by\\nimpaired intestinal absorption of nutrients especially of fat;\\nsome other substances are proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins\\nand minerals. MAS is subdivided into 2 broad groups:\\nPrimary MAS,  which is due to primary deficiency of the\\nabsorptive mucosal surface and of the associated enzymes.\\nSecondary MAS,  in which mucosal changes result\\nsecondary to other factors such as diseases, surgery, traumaand drugs.\\nEach of the two main groups has a number of causes listed\\nin Table 20.8.\\nCLINICAL FEA TURES\\nThe clinical manifestations of MAS vary according to the\\nunderlying cause. However, some common symptoms areas follows:\\nFigure 20.32 Amoebic ulcers large intestine.  A, The luminal surface\\nshows multiple ulcers some of which are deep and are flask-shaped\\nwith narrow neck and broad base (arrow) containing necrotic tissue andundermined margins.

Specific malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies dependingupon the cause.INVESTIGATIONS\\nWhen MAS is suspected on clinical grounds, the following\\ninvestigations (laboratory tests) and endoscopic biopsy) may\\nbe carried out to confirm it:\\nI. LABORATORY TESTS:\\n1. Tests for fat malabsorption:\\ni)Faecal analysis for fat content\\nii)\\nMicroscopic analysis for faecal fat\\niii) Blood lipid levels after a fatty meal\\niv) Tests based on absorption of radioactive-labelled fat.\\n2.

INTESTINAL MUCOSAL BIOPSY:\\nMucosal biopsy of small intestine is essential for making the\\ndiagnosis of MAS and also evaluation of  a patient on follow-\\nup. The availability of endoscopes has enabled easy viewingof affected mucosa directly and taking mucosal biopsy undervision; this has largely replaced the earlier per-oral Crosby-\\nKugler capsule biopsy of small intestine. The biopsy should\\nfirst be examin ed under dissecting microscope before\\nhistologic sectioning.\\nNormal villous (Fig. 20.33,A) .

It is lined by tall colum-\\nnar absorptive epithelium and has scattered lymphocytesin the lamina propria.\\nVillous atrophy.  Variable degree of flattening of intestinal\\nmucosa in MAS is the commonest pathological change in\\nmucosal pattern and is referred to as villous atrophy. Itmay be of 2 types—partial and subtotal/total type.\\nPartial villous atrophy  is the mild form of the lesion\\nin which villi fuse with each other and thus become shortand broad, commonly called as convolutions and irregularridges (Fig. 20.33,B) . The epithelial cells show compen-\\nsatory hyperplasia suggesting a turnover of these cells(Fig. 20.34,A) . Lamina propria shows increased cellular\\ninfiltrate, predominantly of plasma cells.\\nPartial villous atrophy is commonly found in children\\nand adults with diarrhoea, parasitic infestations, Crohn’sdisease, ulcerative colitis and malabsorption due to drugsand radiation injury.\\nSubtotal/Total villous atrophy  is the severe form of the\\nlesion in which there is flattening of mucosa due to moreadvanced villous fusion (Fig. 20.33,C) . The surface\\nepithelium is cuboidal and there is increased plasma cellinfiltrate in the lamina propria (Fig. 20.34,B) .\\nSubtotal and total villous atrophy is exhibited by a\\nnumber of conditions such as nontropical sprue, tropicalsprue, intestinal lymphomas, carcinoma, protein-caloriemalnutrition etc.\\nIMPORTANT  TYPES OF MAS\\nCoeliac S prue (Non-tropical S prue, Gluten-Sensitive\\nEnterop\\nathy, Idiopathic Steatorrhoea)\\nThis is the most important cause of primary malabsorption\\noccurring in temperate climates. The condition ischaracterised by significant loss of villi in the small intestineand thence diminished absorptive surface area. The conditionoccurs in 2 forms:\\nChildhood form,  seen in infants and children and is\\ncommonly referred to as coeliac disease.\\nAdult form,  seen in adolescents and early adult life and used\\nto be called idiopathic steatorrhoea.\\nIn either case, there is genetic abnormality resulting in\\nsensitivity to gluten (a protein) and its derivative, gliadin,\\npresent in diets such as grains of wheat, barley and rye.Serum antibodies—IgA antigliadin and IgA antiendomysial,have been found but is not known whether these antibodiesare primary or appear secondary to tissue damage.\\nThe symptoms are usually relieved on elimination of\\ngluten from the diet. The role of heredity is further supportedby the observation of familial incidence and HLA associationof the disease. Exact pathogenesis of the condition is not clear.However, following hypotheses are significant in causingmucosal cell damage:\\n1.Hypersensitivity reaction  as seen by gluten-stimulated\\nantibodies.2.Toxic effect of gluten due to inherited enzyme deficiency  in\\nthe mucosal cells.Histologically,  there are no differences in the pathological\\nfindings in children and adults. There is variable degree\\nof flattening of the mucosa, particularly of the upper\\njejunum, and to some extent of the duodenum and ileum.The surface epithelial cells are cuboidal or low columnartype. There may be partial villous atrophy  which is\\nreplacement of normal villous pattern by convolutions,or subtotal villous atrophy  characterised by flat mucosal\\nsurface. Lamina propria shows increased number ofplasma cells and \\nlymphocytes (Fig. 20.34) .\\nThe major sequela of long-term coeliac sprue is increased\\nincidence of intestinal carcinoma in these cases.\\nCollagenous Sprue\\nThis entity is regarded as the end-result of coeliac sprue in\\nwhich the villi are totally absent (total villous atrophy)  and\\nthere are unique and diagnostic broad bands of collagenunder the basal lamina of surface epithelium. The condition\\nis refractory to any treatment and the course is generally fatal.\\nSome workers consider collagenous sprue as a variant ofcoeliac sprue without classifying it separately.\\nTropical Sprue\\nThis disease, as the name suggests, occurs in individuals\\nliving in or visiting tropical areas such as Caribbeancountries, South India, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong.Pathogenesis of the condition is not clear but there is evidence\\nto support enterotoxin production by some strains of E. coli\\nwhich causes the intestinal injury. Severe cases are\\ncharacterised by additional features such as macrocyticanaemia, gloss itis and emaciation due to intestinal\\nmalabsorption of vitamin B\\n12 and folate.\\nHistologically,  there is usually partial villous atrophy  and\\nsometimes subtotal atrophy.\\nFigure 20.34 A, Partial villus atrophy . There is shortening and\\nblunting of the villi with reduction in their height. There is crypt hyperplasia.\\nB, Subtotal villous atrophy . There is near total flattening of the villi and\\ncrypt hyperplasia.576SECTION III Systemic PathologyThe lesions are relieved by removal of the patient from\\nthe tropical area and by oral administration of antibiotics\\nbut gluten-free diet has no role in improvement.\\nWhipple’s Disease (Intestinal Lipodystrophy)\\nThis is an uncommon bacterial disease involving not only\\nthe intestines but also various other systems such as centralnervous system, heart, blood vessels, skin, joints, lungs, liver,spleen and kidneys. The disease is more common in malesin 4th to 5th decades of life. Patients may present withfeatures of malabsorption or may have atypical presentationin the form of migratory polyarthritis, neurologicaldisturbances and focal hyperpigmentation of the skin.\\nHistologically,  the affected tissues show presence of\\ncharacteristic macrophages containing PAS-positivegranules and rod-shaped micro-organisms (Whipple’sbacilli). These macrophages are predominantly present inthe lamina propria of the small intestine and mesentericlymph nodes.\\nPatients respond very well to oral antibiotic therapy.\\nProtein-Losing Enteropathies\\nA number of disorders of the gastrointestinal tract are\\naccompanied by excessive protein loss without concomitantincrease in protein synthesis, thus resulting in hypo-proteinaemia. These diseases are listed below:i)Whipple’s disease\\nii\\n) Crohn’s disease\\niii) Ulcerative colitisiv) Spruev) Intestinal lymphangiectasiavi) Ménétrier’s disease (Hypertrophic gastritis).\\nSMALL INTESTINAL TUMOURS\\nAlthough small intestine is about 6 meter long, but for\\nobscure reasons, benign as well as malignant tumours in itare surprisingly rare. Most common benign tumours,  in\\ndescending order of frequency, are: leiomyomas, adenomasand vascular tumours (haemangioma, lymphangioma).Amongst the malignant tumours,  the most frequently\\nencountered, in descending frequency, are: carcinoidtumours, lymphomas (Fig. 20.35) and adenocarcinoma. All\\nthese tumours are identical in morphology to those seenelsewhere in the alimentary tract. Carcinoid tumour, apeculiar neoplasm most common in the midgut, is describedbelow.\\nCarcinoid Tumour (Argentaffinoma)\\nCarcinoid tumour or argentaffinoma is a generic term applied\\nto tumours originating from endocrine cells (synonyms:\\nargentaffin cells, Kulchitsky cells, enterochromaffin cells)belonging to APUD cell system and are therefore also calledas apudomas (page 561). The endocrine cells are distributedthroughout the mucosa of GI tract. These cells have secretorygranules which stain positively with silver salts (argentaffingranules) or many stain after addition of exogenous reducingagent (non-argentaffin or argyrophil granules). Accordingly,carcinoid tumour may be argentaffin or argyrophil type.Depending upon the embryologic derivation of the tissueswhere the tumour is located, these are classified as foregut,midgut, and hindgut carcinoids.\\nMidgut carcinoids,  seen in terminal ileum and appendix\\nare the most common (60-80%) and are more often argentaffinpositive.\\nHindgut carcinoids,  occurring in rectum and colon are\\nmore commonly argyrophil type, and comprise about 10-20% of carcinoids.\\nForegut carcinoids,  located in the stomach, duodenum\\nand oesophagus are also argyrophil type and are encoun-tered as frequently as in the hindgut (10-20%).\\nOther uncommon locations are the bronchus, trachea,\\ngallbladder, and Meckel’s diverticulum.\\nAppendix and terminal ileum, the two most common\\nsites for carcinoids, depict variation in their age and sexincidence and biologic behaviour:\\nAppendiceal carcinoids,  occur more frequently in 3rd\\nand 4th decades of life without any sex predilection, are oftensolitary and behave as locally malignant tumours.\\nIleal carcinoids,  on the other hand, are seen more often\\nin later age (7th decade) with female preponderance, are morecommonly multiple and behave like metastasisingcarcinomas.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  all carcinoids are\\nsmall, button-like submucosal elevations with intact orulcerated overlying mucosa. They are usually small; thoselarger than 2 cm are more often metastasising. Ileal andgastric carcinoids are commonly multiple, whereas\\nFigure 20.35 Lymphoma small intestine. The polypoid growth is\\nseen projecting into lumen while the covering mucosa is ulcerated.577CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tractappendiceal carcinoids commonly involve the tip of the\\norgan and are solitary (Fig. 20.36) . Cut section of all the\\ncarcinoids is bright yellow.Histologically,  the tumour cells may be arranged in a\\nvariety of patterns—solid nests, sheets, cords, trabeculaeand clusters, all of which show characteristic palisadingof the peripheral cells. Acinar arrangement and rosettesare rarely seen. The tumour cells are classically small,monotonous, having uniform nuclei and poorly-definedcell boundaries (Fig. 20.37) . The argentaffin carcinoids\\nshow eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm which stainpositively by the argentaffin reaction. Mitotic figures are\\nrare. However, the cytologic features are a poor guide for\\ndistinguishing clinically benign from malignant behaviourof the tumour, but all carcinoids infiltrate the bowel wall.\\nCARCINOID SYNDROME.  Carcinoid tumours that meta-\\nstasise, especially to the liver, are sometimes associated withthe carcinoid syndrome. The syndrome consists of thefollowing features:1.Intermittent attacks of flushing of the skin of face\\n2. Episodes of watery diarrhoea3. Abdominal pain4.Attacks of dyspnoea due to bronchospasm\\n5.\\nRight-sided heart failure due to involvement of tricuspid\\nand pulmonary valves and endocardium (page 451).\\nA number of secretory products  in a functioning carcinoid\\ntumour have been demonstrated:\\ni) 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin)\\nii) 5-Hydroxytryptophan\\niii) 5-Hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA)iv) Histamine\\nv) Kallikrein\\nvi) Bradykinin\\nHowever, 5-HT and its degradation product, 5-HIAA, are\\nparticularly significant in the production of carcinoid\\nsyndrome.  5-HT, a potent vasodilator and smooth muscle\\nstimulant, is normally synthesised in the endocrine cells ofthe gut from dietary tryptophan. Tryptophan is firsthydroxylated to 5-hydroxytryptophan, then decarboxylatedto 5-HT and further oxidised to 5-HIAA by the monoamineoxidase in the liver cells. It is then excreted in the urine. Thiscapacity to synthesise 5-HT and 5-HIAA is markedly elevatedin primary and hepatic metastatic carcinoids. Midgutcarcinoids have rich decarboxylating enzymes and are thusable to produce large quantities of 5-HT and 5-HIAA,accounting for high frequency of carcinoid syndrome in them.Foregut and hindgut carcinoids, on the other hand, lackdecarboxylating enzymes and, therefore, are less oftenassociated with carcinoid syndrome.\\nAPPENDIX\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nAppendix is a vestigial organ which serves no useful purpose\\nin human beings but instead becomes the site of trouble attimes. It is like a diverticulum of the caecum, usually lyingbehind the caecum and varies in length from 4 to 20 cm(average 7 cm).Figure 20.36 Carcinoid tumour. Gross appearance at common\\nlocations in longitudinal section.\\nFigure 20.37 Microscopic appearance showing solid masses and trabeculae of uniform, monotonous, small cells with palisading of the periphera l\\ncells.\\n578SECTION III Systemic PathologyHistologically,  appendix has four layers in its wall —\\nmucosa, submucosa, muscularis  and serosa.  The mucosa has\\npatchy distribution of crypts and the submucosa has\\nabundant lymphoid tissue. Argentaffin and non-argentaffin endocrine cells are present in the base ofmucosal glands just as in the small intestine. The muscu-laris of the appendix has two layers (inner circular andouter longitudinal) as elsewhere in the alimentary tract.\\nTwo important diseases involving the appendix are\\nappendicitis and appendiceal carcinoids.\\nAPPENDICITIS\\nAcute inflammation of the appendix, acute appendicitis, is\\nthe most common acute abdominal condition confronting thesurgeon. The condition is seen more commonly in older\\nchildren and young adults, and is uncommon at the extremes\\nof age. The disease is seen more frequently in the West andin affluent societies which may be due to variation in diet—a diet with low bulk or cellulose and high protein intake more\\noften causes appendicitis.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The most common mechanism is\\nobstruction of the lumen from various etiologic factors that\\nleads to increased intraluminal pressure. This presses uponthe blood vessels to produce ischaemic injury which in turnfavours the bacterial proliferation and hence acute\\nappendicitis. The common causes of appendicitis are as\\nunder:\\nA.Obstructive:\\n1. Faecolith\\n2. Calculi\\n3.Foreign body\\n4.\\nTumour\\n5. Worms (especially Enterobius vermicularis)\\n6. Diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia, especially in children.\\nB. Non-obstructive:\\n1. Haematogenous spread of generalised infection2. Vascular occlusion3. Inappropriate diet lacking roughage.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the appearance\\ndepends upon the stage at which the acutely-inflamed\\nappendix is examined. In early acute appendicitis, the organ\\nis swollen and serosa shows hyperaemia. In well-\\ndeveloped acute inflammation called acute suppurative\\nappendicitis,  the serosa is coated with fibrinopurulent\\nexudate and engorged vessels on the surface. In furtheradvanced cases called acute gangrenous appendicitis,  there\\nis necrosis and ulcerations of mucosa which extendthrough the wall so that the appendix becomes soft and\\nfriable and the surface is coated with greenish-black\\ngangrenous necrosis (Fig. 20.38) .\\nMicroscopically,  the most important diagnostic histological\\ncriterion is the neutrophilic infiltration of the muscularis.  In\\nearly stage, the other changes besides acute inflammatorychanges, are congestion and oedema of the appendicealwall. In later stages, the mucosa is sloughed off, the wall\\nbecomes necrotic, the blood vessels may get thrombosed\\nand there may be neutrophilic abscesses in the wall. Ineither case, an impacted foreign body, faecolith, or con-\\ncretion may be seen in the lumen (Fig. 20.39) .Figure 20.38 Acute appendicitis. Gross appearance of longitudinally\\nopened appendix showing impacted faecolith in the lumen and exudate\\non the serosa.\\nFigure 20.39 Acute appendicitis. Microscopic appearance showing diagnostic neutrophilic infiltration into the muscularis. Other changes\\npresent are necrosis of mucosa and periappendicitis.\\n579CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal TractThus, there is good correlation between macroscopic\\nand microscopic findings in acute appendicitis.\\nCLINICAL COURSE.  The patient presents with features of\\nacute abdomen as under:\\n1.Colicky pain, initially around umbilicus but later localised\\nto right iliac fossa2.\\nNausea and vomiting\\n3. Pyrexia of mild grade4. Abdominal tenderness5. Increased pulse rate6. Neutrophilic leucocytosis.\\nAn attack of acute appendicitis predisposes the appendix\\nto repeated attacks (recurrent acute appendicitis)  and thus\\nsurgery has to be carried out. If appendicectomy is done at alater stage following acute attack (interval appendicectomy),\\npathological changes of healing by fibrosis of the wall andchronic inflammation are observed.\\nCOMPLICATIONS.  If the condition is not adequately\\nmanaged, the following complications may occur:\\n1. Peritonitis.  A perforated appendix as occurs in\\ngangrenous appendicitis may cause localised or generalised\\nperitonitis.\\n2.\\nAppendix abscess.  This is due to rupture of an appendix\\ngiving rise to localised abscess in the right iliac fossa. This\\nabscess may spread to other sites such as between the liverand diaphragm (subphrenic abscess), into the pelvis betweenthe urinary bladder and rectum, and in the females may\\ninvolve uterus and fallopian tubes.\\n3. Adhesions.  Late complications of acute appendicitis are\\nfibrous adhesions to the greater omentum, small intestine\\nand other abdominal structures.\\n4. Portal pylephlebitis.  Spread of infection into mesenteric\\nveins may produce septic phlebitis and liver abscess.\\n5. Mucocele.  Distension of distal appendix by mucus\\nfollowing recovery from an attack of acute appendicitis is\\nreferred to as mucocele. It occurs generally due to proximalobstruction but sometimes may be due to a benign ormalignant neoplasm in the appendix. An infected mucocelemay result in formation of empyema of the appendix.\\nTUMOURS OF APPENDIX\\nTumours of the appendix are quite rare. These include:\\ncarcinoid tumour (the most common), pseudomyxomaperitonei and adenocarcinoma.\\nCARCINOID TUMOUR.  It is already described on page 576.\\nBoth argentaffin and argyrophil types are encountered, the\\nformer being more common.\\nGrossly,  carcinoid tumour of the appendix is mostly\\nsituated near the tip of the organ and appears as acircumscribed nodule, usually less than 1 cm in diameter,involving the wall but metastases are rare.Histologically,  carcinoid tumour of the appendix\\nresembles other carcinoids of the midgut.PSEUDOMYXOMA PERITONEI. Pseudomyxoma peritonei\\nis appearance of gelatinous mucinous material around theappendix admixed with epithelial tumour cells. It is generallydue to mucinous collection from benign mucinouscystadenoma of the ovary or mucin-secreting carcinoma ofthe appendix.\\nADENOCARCINOMA.  It is an uncommon tumour in the\\nappendix and is morphologically similar to adenocarcinoma\\nelsewhere in the alimentary tract.\\nLARGE INTESTINE\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe large bowel consists of 6 parts—the caecum, ascending\\ncolon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon andrectum, and in all measures about 1.5 meters in length. Theserosal surface of the large intestine except the rectum isstudded with appendices epiploicae  which are small, rounded\\ncollections of fatty tissue covered by peritoneum.\\nHistologically,  the wall of large bowel consists of 4 layers as\\nelsewhere in the alimentary tract—serosa, muscularis,\\nsubmucosa and mucosa.\\nThe mucosa lacks villi and there is preponderance of\\ngoblet cells over columnar epithelial cells. The lymphoidtissue is less abundant than in the small bowel but lymphoidfollicles are seen in the caecum and rectum.\\nThe muscularis propria  of the large intestine is quite\\npeculiar—the inner circular muscle layer ensheaths wholelength of the intestine, while the outer longitudinal musclelayer is concentrated into 3 muscle bands called taenia coli.\\nThe length of outer muscle layer is shorter than the length ofthe intestine and therefore, it forms the sacculations or haustra\\nof the large intestine. At the rectosigmoid junction, the threemuscle bands fuse to form a complete covering.\\nThe blood supply  to the right colon is from the superior\\nmesenteric artery which also supplies blood to the smallbowel. The remaining portion of large bowel except the lowerpart of rectum receives blood supply from inferior mesentericartery. The lower rectum is supplied by haemorrhoidalbranches.\\nThe innervation  of the large bowel consists of 3 plexuses\\nof ganglion cells— Auerbach’s  or myenteric plexus lying\\nbetween the two layers of muscularis, Henle’s plexus  lying in\\nthe deep submucosa inner to circular muscle layer, andMeissner plexus that lies in the superficial mucosa just beneaththe muscularis mucosae. These are interconnected by non-myelinated nerve fibres.\\nAnal canal,  3-4 cm long tubular structure, begins at the\\nlower end of the rectum, though is not a part of large bowel,but is included here to cover simultaneously lesionspertaining to this region. It is lined by keratinised ornonkeratinised stratified squamous epithelium. Anal verge\\nis the junction between the anal canal and perineal skin, whilepectinate line  is the squamo-columnar junction between the\\nanal canal and the rectum.580SECTION III Systemic PathologyCONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS\\nHirschsprung’s Disease (Congenital Megacolon)\\nThe term ‘megacolon’ is used for any form of marked\\ndilatation of the entire colon or its segment and may occur\\nas a congenital or acquired disorder. Congenital form\\ncharacterised by congenital absence of ganglion cells in the\\nbowel wall (enteric neurons) is called Hirschsprung’s disease.As a result, the aganglionic segment remains contracted.\\nGenetically, Hirschsprung’s disease is a heterogeneous\\ndisorder as under:1. Autosomal dominant inheritance with mutation in RET\\nproto-oncogene in some cases.\\n2. Autosomal recessive form with mutation in endothelin-B\\nreceptor gene in many other cases.\\nClinically, the condition manifests shortly after birth with\\nconstipation, gaseous distension and sometimes with acuteintestinal obstruction. Its frequency is 1 in 5,000 live-births,has familial tendency in about 4% of cases and has\\npredilection for development in Down’s syndrome.\\nPathogenesis lies in the failure of neuroblasts to migrate tothe rectum which normally occurs at about 12 weeks ofgestation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Two types of biopsies may\\nbe done on infants suspected of having Hirschsprung’sdisease—full-thickness rectal biopsy, and suction biopsythat includes mucosa and submucosa.Grossly,  typical case of Hirschsprung’s disease shows 2\\nsegments—a distal narrow segment  that is aganglionic and\\na dilated proximal segment  that contains normal number of\\nganglion cells (Fig. 20.40) .\\nMicroscopically,  the distal narrow segment shows total\\nabsence of ganglion cells of all the three plexuses(Auerbach’s or myenteric plexus present between the twolayers of muscularis, deep submucosal or Henle’s plexus,and superficial mucosal or Meissner’s plexus) and\\nprominence of non-myelinated nerve fibres. Histo-\\nchemical staining for acetylcholine esterase activityprovides confirmation for identifying ganglion cells andnerve trunks.\\nDepending upon the length of the segment affected by\\naganglionosis in Hirschsprung’s disease, following patternsare recognised:\\n1.Classic form:  Anganglionosis from distal colorectal region\\nto proximal dilated colon.2. Short segment (rectal and recto-sigmoid) form:  Aganglionosis\\ninvolving a few centimeters of the rectum and rectosigmoid\\nonly.\\n3.Ultra-short form: Aganglionosis is in a very small segment\\nwhich can be missed in a biopsy.4.\\nLong segment (subtotal colonic) form: Aganglionosis\\ninvolves most of the colon from rectosigmoid to the ileo-\\ncaecal valve, and sometimes may even extend into smll\\nbowel.5.Zonal colonic aganglionosis: A short segment is nvolved in\\nagnaglionosis in which the ganglia cells are absent both above\\nand below the aganglionic segment.\\nIn addition to congenital megacolon discussed above,\\nmegacolon may occur from certain acquired causes  as under:\\ni.Obstructive  e.g. due to tumour, post-inflammatory\\nstrictures.ii.Endocrine  e.g. in myxoedema, cretinism.\\niii.CNS disorders  e.g. spina bifida, paraplegia, parkinsonism.\\niv.Psychogenic  e.g. emotional disturbances, psychiatric\\ndisorders.v.Chagas’ disease  due to infection with Trypanosoma cruzi  is\\nthe only example resulting in acquired loss of ganglion cells.In all other acquired causes listed above, the bowelinnervation is normal.\\nCOLITIS\\nColitis may occur in isolation but more commonly\\ninvolvement of small intestine is also present (enterocolitis).In view of the considerable overlapping of enteritis andcolitis, these lesions have already been described under smallintestine (page 578). Table 20.9  presents a classification of\\nthe various types of colitis/enterocolitis.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 20.9: Classification of Colitis/Enterocolitis.\\nI.

Multiple diverticula of the colon are very commonin the Western societies, probably due to ingestion of low-fibre diet but is seen much less frequently in tropical countriesand in Japan. Diverticulosis is often asymptomatic and maybe detected as an incidental finding at autopsy. However, aproportion of patients develop clinical symptoms such aslow abdominal pain, distension, constipation and sometimesintermittent bleeding.\\nBased on the etiologic role of low fibre diet, pathogenesis\\nof diverticular disease of the colon can be explained as under:\\n1.Increased intraluminal pressure  such as due to low fibre\\ncontent of the diet causing hyperactive peristalsis and thereby\\nsequestration, of mucosa and submucosa.\\n2.Muscular weakness  of the colonic wall at the junction of\\nthe muscularis with submucosa.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  diverticulosis is\\nseen most commonly in the sigmoid colon (95%) but any\\nother part of the entire colon may be involved. They mayvary in number from a few to several hundred. Theyappear as small, spherical or flask-shaped outpouchings,usually less than 1 cm in diameter, commonly extend intoappendices epiploicae and may contain inspissated faeces.They are connected to the intestinal lumen by a narrowneck.\\nHistologically , the flask-shaped structures extend from\\nthe intestinal lumen through the muscle layer. The colonic\\nwall in the affected area is thin and is composed of atrophicmucosa, compressed submucosa and thin or deficientmuscularis. However, muscularis propria in between thediverticular protrusions is hypertrophied. While diverti-cular disease may remain asymptomatic, inflammatorychanges in the diverticula (diverticulitis) produce clinicalsymptoms.\\nThe complications  of diverticulosis and diverticulitis are\\nperforation, haemorrhage, intestinal obstruction and fistulaformation.\\nMelanosis Coli\\nMelanosis coli is a peculiar condition in which mucosa of\\nthe large intestine acquires brown-black colouration. Thecondition is said to occur in individuals who are habitualusers of cathartics of anthracene type.\\nGrossly,  the mucosal surface is intact and is pigmented\\nbrown-black.Microscopically,  large number of pigment-laden\\nmacrophages are seen in the lamina propria. The natureof this pigment is found to be both melanin and lipofuscin.Haemorrhoids (Piles)\\nHaemorrhoids or piles are the varicosities of the haemorrhoi-\\ndal veins. They are called ‘internal piles’  if dilatation is of\\nsuperior haemorrhoidal plexus covered over by mucousmembrane, and ‘external piles ’ if they involve inferior\\nhaemorrhoidal plexus covered over by the skin. They arecommon lesions in elderly and pregnant women. Theycommonly result from increased venous pressure. Thepossible causes include the following:1.Portal hypertension\\n2.Chronic constipation and straining at stool\\n3.\\nCardiac failure\\n4. Venous stasis of pregnancy5. Hereditary predisposition6. Tumours of the rectum.\\nMicroscopically,  thin-walled and dilated tortuous veins\\nare seen under the rectal mucosa (internal piles)  or anal\\nskin (external piles).  Secondary changes and complications\\nthat may occur include: thrombosis, haemorrhage,inflammation, scarring and strangulation (prolapsed piles).\\nAngiodysplasia\\nAngiodysplasia is a submucosal telangiectasia affecting\\ncaecum and right colon that causes recurrent acute andchronic haemorrhage. The condition is more common in theelderly past 6th decade. The pathogenesis is obscure but ispossibly due to mechanical obstruction of the veins.\\nMISCELLANEOUS INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS\\n‘Fistula-in-ano’  is a well known and common condition\\nin which one or more fistulous tracts pass from the internal\\nopening at the pectinate line through the internal sphincteron to the skin surface. The condition probably results frominfection of the anal glands.\\nHistologically,  nonspecific inflammatory changes are seen.\\n‘Anal fissure’  is an ulcer in the anal canal below the level\\nof the pectinate line, mostly in midline and posteriorly. The\\ncommon cause is trauma due to passage of hard stools,followed by chronic infection.\\n‘Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome’  is a condition charac-\\nterised usually by solitary, at times multiple, rectal ulcerswith prolapse of rectal mucosa and development of proctitis.The histological appearance is quite characteristic. Besidesulceration and inflammation of the rectal mucosa, laminapropria is occupied by spindle-shaped fibroblasts and smoothmuscle cells. The condition is also called as ‘localised form of\\ncolitis cystica profunda’  and must be differentiated from ‘diffuse\\nform of colitis cystica profunda’  seen in cases of ulcerative colitis.\\nSubmucosal cysts lined by foreign body giant cells andcontaining gas are also seen in ‘pneumatosis cystoides\\nintestinalis’.\\nLARGE INTESTINAL POLYPS AND  TUMOURS\\nLarge bowel is the most common site for a variety of benign\\nand malignant tumours, majority of which are of epithelial582SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\norigin. Most of the benign tumours present clinically as\\npolyps. A classification of polyps, alongwith benign tumoursand malignant tumours, is presented in Table 20.10.\\nCOLORECTA L\\n POLYPS\\nA polyp is defined as any growth or mass protruding fromthe mucous membrane into the lumen. Polyps are much morecommon in the large intestine than in the small intestine andare more common in the rectosigmoid colon than theproximal colon. Polyps are broadly classified into 2 groups—non-neoplastic and neoplastic. Non-neoplastic polyps havefurther subtypes indicating their mode of origin. Neoplasticpolyps, on the other hand, include epithelial tumours, bothbenign and malignant (Table 20.10).\\nA.NON-NEOPLASTIC POL\\nYPS\\nNon-neoplastic polyps are more common and include thefollowing 4 subtypes:\\nHyperplastic (Metaplastic) Polyps\\nThe hyperplastic or metaplastic polyps are the most common\\namongst all epithelial polyps, particularly in therectosigmoid. They are called ‘hyperplastic’  because there is\\nepithelial hyperplasia at the base of the crypts, and‘metaplastic’ as there are areas of cystic metaplasia. They may\\nbe seen at any age but are more common in the elderly(6th-7th decade).\\nGrossly,  hyperplastic polyps are generally multiple,\\nsessile, smooth-surfaced and small (less than 0.5 cm).Microscopically,  they are composed of long and cystically\\ndilated glands and crypts lined by normal epithelial cells.Their lining is partly flat and partly papillary. The luminalborder of the lining epithelium is often serrated or saw-toothed.\\nHyperplastic polyps are usually symptomless and have\\nno malignant potential unless there is a coexistent adenoma.\\nHamartomatous Polyps\\nThese are tumour-like lesions composed of abnormal mixture\\nof tissues indigenous to the part. They are further of 2 types:\\nPEUTZ-JEGHERS POLYPS AND POLYPOSIS.  Peutz-\\nJeghers syndrome is autosomal dominant defect, charac-\\nterised by hamartomatous intestinal polyposis and melanoticpigmentation of lips, mouth and genitalia. The polyps maybe located in the stomach, small intestine or colon but aremost common in the jejunum and ileum. The most commonage is adolescence and early childhood.\\nGrossly,  these polyps are of variable size but are often\\nlarge, multiple and pedunculated and more commonlysituated in the small intestine.Microscopically,  the most characteristic feature is the tree-\\nlike branching of muscularis mucosae. The liningepithelium is by normal-appearing epithelial cells. Theglands may show hyperplasia and cystic change(Fig. 20.41) .\\nPeutz-Jeghers polyps do not undergo malignant\\ntransformation unless a coexistent adenoma is present.However, patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are moreprone to certain other cancers such as of pancreas, lung,breast, ovary and uterus.\\nJUVENILE (RETENTION) POLYPS.  Juvenile or retention\\npolyps, another form of hamartomatous polyps, occur more\\ncommonly in children below 5 years of age. Solitary juvenilepolyps occur more often in the rectum, while juvenilepolyposis may be present anywhere in the large bowel.\\nGrossly,  juvenile polyps are spherical, smooth-surfaced,\\nabout 2 cm in diameter and are often pedunculated.Microscopically,  the classical appearance is of cystically\\ndilated glands containing mucus and lined by normalmucus-secreting epithelium. The stroma may showinflammatory cell infiltrate if there is chronic ulcerationof the surface (Fig. 20.42) .\\nMost cases, on becoming symptomatic in the form of\\nrectal bleeding, are removed. In common with other non-neoplastic polyps, they are also not precancerous.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 20.10: Polyps and Tumours of the Large Intestine.\\nI. COLORECTAL POLYPS\\nA.

Localised form occurs more often in the rectum inelderly, while diffuse form is seen at younger age and inchildren.\\nGrossly,  they are solitary or multiple, tiny elevated lesions.\\nMicroscopically,  they are composed of prominent\\nlymphoid follicles with germinal centres located in thesubmucosa and mucosa, and are covered by epitheliumthat may be inflamed.\\nThey are benign lesions and have to be distinguished from\\nmalignant lymphoma.\\nB. NEOPLASTIC POLYPS (ADENOMAS)\\nNeoplastic polyps are colorectal adenomas which have\\npotential for malignant change while polypoid carcinoma isFigure 20.41 Hamartomatous polyps: Peutz-Jeghers polyp.\\nFigure 20.42 Juvenile polyp.\\n584SECTION III Systemic Pathologythe term used for invasive epithelial tumours. Adenomas\\nhave 3 main varieties (tubular, villous and tubulovillous),each of which represents a difference in the growth patternof the same neoplastic process and variable biologicalbehaviour.\\nTubular Adenoma (Adenomatous Polyp)\\nTubular adenomas or adenomatous polyps are the most\\ncommon neoplastic polyps (75%). They are common beyond3rd decade of life and have slight male preponderance. Theyoccur most often in the distal colon and rectum. They maybe found singly as sporadic cases, or multiple tubularadenomas as part of familial polyposis syndrome withautosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Tubular adenomasmay remain asymptomatic or may manifest by rectalbleeding.\\nGrossly,  adenomatous polyps may be single or multiple,\\nsessile or pedunculated, vary in size from less than 1 cmto large, spherical masses with an irregular surface.Usually, the larger lesions have recognisable stalks.Microscopically,  the usual appearance is of benign\\ntumour overlying muscularis mucosa and is composedof branching tubules which are embedded in the laminapropria. The lining epithelial cells are of large intestinaltype with diminished mucus secreting capacity, largenuclei and increased mitotic activity (Fig. 20.43,A) .\\nHowever, tubular adenomas may show variable degreeof cytologic atypia ranging from atypical epitheliumrestricted within the glandular basement membrane calledas ‘carcinoma in situ’  to invasion into the fibrovascular\\nstromal core termed as frank adenocarcinoma.Malignant transformation is present in about 5% of\\ntubular adenomas; the incidence being higher in larger\\nadenomas.\\nVillous Adenoma (Villous Papilloma)\\nVillous adenomas or villous papillomas of the colon are much\\nless common than tubular adenomas. The mean age at which\\nthey appear is 6th decade of life with approximatey equalsex incidence. They are seen most often in the distal colonand rectum, followed in decreasing frequency, by rest of the\\ncolon.\\nGrossly,  villous adenomas are round to oval exophytic\\nmasses, usually sessile, varying in size from 1 to 10 cm or\\nmore in diameter. Their surface may be haemorrhagic orulcerated.\\nMicroscopically,  the characteristic histologic feature is the\\npresence of many slender, finger-like villi, which appear\\nto arise directly from the area of muscularis mucosae. Eachof the papillae has fibrovascular stromal core that is\\ncovered by epithelial cells varying from apparently benign\\nto anaplastic cells. Excess mucus secretion is sometimesseen (Fig. 20.43,B) .\\nVillous adenomas are invariably symptomatic; rectal\\nbleeding, diarrhoea and mucus being the common features.The presence of severe atypia, carcinoma in situ  and invasive\\ncarcinoma are seen more frequently. Invasive carcinoma hasbeen reported in 30% of villous adenomas.\\nTubulovillous Adenoma\\n(Papillary Adenoma, Villoglandular Adenoma)\\nTubulovillo\\nus adenoma is an intermediate form of pattern\\nbetween tubular adenoma and villous adenoma. It is alsoFigure 20.43 Adenomas (neoplastic polyps)—three main varieties.\\n585CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tractknown by other names like papillary adenoma and villo-\\nglandular adenoma. The distribution of these adenomas isthe same as for tubular adenomas.\\nGrossly,  tubulovillous adenomas may be sessile or\\npedunculated and range in size from 0.5-5 cm.Microscopically,  they show intermediate or mixed\\npattern, characteristic vertical villi and deeper partshowing tubular pattern (Fig. 20.43,C) .\\nThe behaviour of tubulovillous adenoma is intermediate\\nbetween tubular and villous adenomas.\\nThe contrasting features of non-neoplastic and neoplastic\\ncolorectal polyps are given in Table 20.11.\\nC.F\\nAMILIAL POLYPOSIS SYNDROMES\\nFamilial polyposis syndromes are a group of disorders withmultiple polyposis of the colon with autosomal dominantinheritance pattern. Important conditions included in familialpolyposis are:1.Familial polyposis coli (adenomatosis)\\n2.Gardner’s syndrome\\n3.\\nTurcot’s syndrome\\n4. Juvenile polyposis syndrome\\nSome other conditions in which multiple polyposis of\\ncolon occur but do not have familial basis are Peutz-Jegherssyndrome (hamartomatous), Cronkhite-Canada syndrome(inflammatory), and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. Thefamilial polyposis syndromes are as follows.\\nFamilial Polyposis Coli (Adenomatosis)\\nThis hereditary disease is defined as the presence of more\\nthan 100 neoplastic polyps (adenomas) on the mucosalsurface of the colon; the average number is about 1000(Fig. 20.44) . Adenomatosis can be distinguished from\\nmultiple adenomas in which the number of adenomas isfewer, not exceeding 100. The condition has autosomaldominant transmission and is due to germline mutations inAPC  gene which results in occurrence of hundreds of\\nadenomas which progress to invasive cancer. The averageage at diagnosis is 2nd and 3rd decades of life with equalincidence in both the sexes.Grossly and microscopically,  the commonest pattern is\\nthat of adenomatous polyps (tubular adenomas)discussed above.\\nThe malignant potential of familial polyposis coli is very\\nhigh. Colorectal cancer develops virtually in 100% of casesby age of 50 years if not treated with colectomy. This subjectof ‘adenoma-carcinoma sequence’ has been discussed againon page 58\\n6.\\nGardner’s Syndrome\\nGardner’s syndrome is combination of familial polyposis coli\\nand certain extra-colonic lesions such as multiple osteomas(particularly of the mandible and maxilla), sebaceous cysts\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 20.11: Contrasting Features of Non-neoplastic and Neoplastic Colorectal Polyps.\\nFeature Non-neoplastic polyps Neoplastic polyps (Adenomas)\\n1.

The number of polyps in\\nGardner’s syndrome is generally fewer than in the familialpolyposis coli but their clinical behaviour is identical.\\nTurcot’s Syndrome\\nTurcot’s syndrome is combination of familial polyposis coli\\nand malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system.\\nJuvenile Polyposis Syndrome\\nJuvenile polyposis is appearance of multiple juvenile polyps\\nin the colon, stomach and small intestine but their number isnot as high as in familial polyposis coli. Family history insome cases may show autosomal dominant inheritancepattern, while it may be negative in others. They resemblethe typical juvenile polyps as regards their age (under 5years), sex distribution and morphology. They lack themalignant potential.\\nOTHER BENIGN TUMOURS\\nSome non-epithelial benign tumours that may rarely occur\\nin large intestine are leiomyomas, leiomyoblastoma, neuri-lemmoma, lipoma and vascular tumours (haemangioma,lymphangioma).\\nMALIGNANT COLORECTAL TUMOURS\\nA.Colorect\\nal Carcinoma\\nColorectal cancer comprises 98% of all malignant tumours\\nof the large intestine. It is the commonest form of visceralcancer accounting for deaths from cancer in the United States,next only to lung cancer. The incidence of carcinoma of thelarge intestine rises with age; average age of patients is about60 years. Cancer in the rectum is more common in malesthan females in the ratio of 2:1, while at other locations inthe large bowel the overall incidence is equal for both sexes.\\nETIOLOGY.  As with most other cancers, etiology of\\ncolorectal carcinoma is not clear but a few etiological factors\\nhave been implicated:\\n1.Geographic variations.  The incidence of large bowel\\ncarcinoma shows wide variation throughout the world. It is\\nmuch more common in North America, Northern Europethan in South America, Africa and Asia. Colorectal cancer isgenerally thought to be a disease of affluent societies becauseits incidence is directly correlated with the socioeconomicstatus of the countries. In Japan, however, colon cancer ismuch less common than in the US but the incidence of rectalcancer is similar.\\n2\\n. Dietary factors.  Diet plays a significant part in the\\ncausation of colorectal cancer:\\ni) A low intake of vegetable fibre-diet leading to low stoolbulk is associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer.ii) Consumption of large amounts of fatty foods bypopulations results in excessive cholesterol and theirmetabolites which may be carcinogenic.iii)Excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates that\\nremain in contact with the colonic mucosa for prolongedduration changes the bacterial flora of the bowel, thusresulting in production of carcinogenic substances.\\n3. Adenoma-carcinoma sequence.  There is strong evidence\\nto suggest that colonic adenocarcinoma evolves from pre-\\nexisting adenomas, referred to as adenoma-carcinomasequence (Fig. 20.45) . The following evidences are cited to\\nsupport this hypothesis:i)In a case with early invasive cancer, the surrounding\\ntissue often shows preceding changes  of evolution from\\nadenoma  → hyperplasia  → dysplasia  → carcinoma in situ  →\\ninvasive carcinoma.ii)Incidence  of adenomas in a population is directly propor-\\ntionate to the prevalence of colorectal cancer.iii) The risk of adenocarcinoma colon declines with endoscopic\\nremoval  of all identified adenomas.\\niv) Peak incidence of adenomas generally precedes  by some\\nyears to a few decades the peak incidence for colorectalcancer.v)\\nThe risk of malignancy increases with the following\\nadenoma-related factors:a)Number  of adenomas : familial polyposis coli syndrome\\nalmost certainly evolves into malignancy.\\nb)Size of adenomas : large size increases the risk.\\nc)Type of adenomas : greater villous component associated\\nwith higher prevalence.\\n4. Hereditary non-polyposis colonic cancer (HNPCC orLynch syndrome).   HNPCC is an autosomal dominant\\ncondition in which colorectal cancer is seen in at least twogenerations of first-degree relatives before the age of 50 years,without evidence of familial polyposis coli. There are germlinemutations in mismatch repair genes, human mutL homologabbreviated as hMLH2 located on chromosome 2 and hMLH1\\non chromosome 3 resulting in DNA instability. In HNPCC,colon cancer appears at a relatively younger age (<50 years),association with multiple primary cancers at different sites(e.g. endometrium, ovary), preferred location in proximalcolon and better prognosis than other sporadic colon cancercases.\\n5. Other factors.  Presence of certain pre-existing diseases\\nsuch as inflammatory bowel disease (especially ulcerative\\ncolitis) and diverticular disease for long duration increasethe risk of developing colorectal cancer subsequently. It maybe recalled here that low fibre diet is implicated in thepathogenesis of diverticular disease as well. Besides, thereis an etiologic role of tobacco smoking in development ofcolorectal cancer in youger patients.\\nGENETIC BASIS OF COLORECTAL CARCINOGENESIS.\\nStudies by molecular genetics have revealed that there aresequential multistep mutations in evolution of colorectalcancer from adenomas by one of the following twomechanisms:\\n1. APC mutation/  β  β β  β β-catenin mechanism.  This pathway of\\nmultiple mutations is generally associated with\\nmorphologically identifiable changes as described above inadenoma-carcinoma sequence. These changes are as under:i) Loss of tumour suppressor  APC (adenomatous polyposis coli)\\ngene located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) is present587CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal TractFigure 20.45 Adenoma-carcinoma sequence—schematic diagram of molecular and morphologic evolution.\\nin 80% cases of sporadic colon cancer. Since the function of\\nAPC  gene is linked to  β-catenin, loss of APC  gene results in\\ntranslocation of β-catenin to the nucleus where it activates\\ntranscription of other genes, mainly MYC  and cyclin D1, both\\nof which stimulate cell proliferation.ii)Point mutation in K-RAS gene  follows loss of APC  gene\\nand is seen in 10 to 50% cases of adenoma-carcinoma.iii)Deletion of DCC gene  located on long arm of chromosome\\n18 i.e. 18q (DCC for deleted in colorectal cancer) in 60-70%\\ncases of colon cancer.iv)Loss of p53  tumour suppressor gene seen in 70-80% cases of\\ncolon cancer.\\n2. Microsatellite instability mechanism. In this pathway\\nalso, there are multiple mutations but of different genes,\\nand unlike APC mutation/ β-catenin mechanism there are\\nno morphologically identifiable changes. This pathwayaccounts for 10-15% cases of colon cancer. Basic mutationis loss of DNA repair gene. This results in a situation inwhich repetitive DNA sequences (i.e. microsatellites)become unstable during replication cycle, termedmicrosatellite instability, which is the hallmark of thispathway. The significant DNA repair genes which aremutated in colon cancer are as under:i) TGF-\\nβ receptor  gene which normally inhibits cell\\nproliferation but in mutated form allows the uncontrolledproliferation of colonic epithelium in adenoma.ii) BAX gene which normally causes apoptosis but a defect in\\nit results in loss of apoptosis and dysregulated growth.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Distribution  of the primary\\ncolorectal cancer reveals that about 60% of the cases occurin the rectum, followed in descending order, by sigmoidand descending colon (25%), caecum and ileocaecal valve(10%); ascending colon, hepatic and splenic flexures (5%);and quite uncommonly in the transverse colon (Fig. 20.46) .\\nGrossly,  there are distinct differences between the growth\\non the right and left half of the colon (Fig. 20.47) .\\nFigure 20.46 Distribution of the primary colorectal cancer.\\n588SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nRight-sided colonic growths  tend to be large, cauli-\\nflower-like, soft and friable masses projecting into the\\nlumen (fungating polypoid carcinoma).\\nLeft-sided colonic growths,  on the other hand, have\\nnapkin-ring configuration i.e. they encircle the bowel wallcircumferentially with increased fibrous tissue formingannular ring, and have central ulceration on the surfacewith slightly elevated margins (carcinomatous ulcers).\\nThese differences in right and left colonic growths are\\nprobably due to the liquid nature of the contents in theascending colon leaving space for luminal growth on rightside, while the contents in left colon are more solidpermitting the spread of growth into the bowel wall.However, early lesion in left as well as right colon aresmall, button-like areas of elevation.Microscopically,  the appearance of right and left-sided\\ngrowths is similar. About 95% of colorectal carcinomasare adenocarcinomas of varying grades of differentiation,out of which approximately 10% are mucin-secretingcolloid carcinomas (Fig. 20.48) .\\n The remaining 5% tumours\\ninclude uncommon microscopic patterns like undifferen-tiated carcinoma, signet-ring cell carcinoma, and adeno-squamous carcinomas seen in more distal colon near theanus. The histologic grades indicating the degree ofdifferentiation are: well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated and poorly-differentiated.\\nSPREAD.  Carcinoma of the large intestine may spread by\\nthe following routes:\\n1.Direct spread.  The tumour spreads most commonly by\\ndirect extension in both ways— circumferentially  into theFigure 20.47 Gross appearance of colorectal carcinoma. A, Right-sided growth —fungating polypoid carcinoma showing cauliflower-like growth\\nprojecting into the lumen. B, Left-sided growth—napkin-ring configuration with spread of growth into the bowel wall.\\n589CHAPTER 20 The Gastrointestinal Tractbowel wall as well as directly  into the depth of the bowel\\nwall to the serosa, pericolic fat, and sometimes into peritoneal\\ncavity.\\n2. Lymphatic spread.  Spread via lymphatics occurs rather\\ncommonly and involves, firstly the regional lymph nodes in\\nthe vicinity of the tumour, and then into other groups of\\nlymph nodes like preaortic, internal iliac and the sacral lymph\\nnodes.\\n3. Haematogenous spread.  Blood spread of large bowel\\ncancer occurs relatively late and involves the liver, lungs,\\nbrain, bones and ovary.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinical symptoms in colorectal\\ncancer appear after considerable time. These are as follows:\\ni)Occult bleeding (melaena)\\nii)Change in bowel habits, more often in left-sided growth\\niii)\\nLoss of weight (cachexia)\\niv) Loss of appetite (anorexia)v) Anaemia, weakness, malaise.\\nThe most common complications  are obstruction and\\nhaemorrhage; less often perforation and secondary infectionmay occur. Aside from the diagnostic methods like stool testfor occult blood, PR examination, proctoscopy, radiographic\\ncontrast studies and CT scan, recently the role of tumour-\\nmarkers has been emphasised. Of particular importance isthe estimation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levelwhich is elevated in 100% cases of metastatic colorectal\\ncancers, while it is positive in 20-40% of early lesions, and\\n60-70% of advanced primary lesions. However, the test mayhave prognostic significance only and is not diagnostic ofcolorectal cancer because it is positive in other cancers too\\nsuch as of the lungs, breast, ovary, urinary bladder and\\nprostate. CEA levels are elevated in some non-neoplasticconditions also like in ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis andalcoholic cirrhosis.STAGING AND PROGNOSIS.  The prognosis  of colorectal\\ncancer depends upon a few variables:i)Extent of the bowel involvement\\nii)Presence or absence of metastases\\niii)\\nHistologic grade of the tumour\\niv) Location of the tumour\\nThe most important prognostic factor in colorectal cancer\\nis, however, the stage  of the disease at the time of diagnosis.\\nThree staging systems are in use:1.Dukes’ ABC staging  (modified Duke’s includes stage D as\\nwell).2.Astler-Coller staging  which is a further modification of\\nDuke’s staging and is most widely used.3.TNM staging  described by American Joint Committee is\\nalso used.\\nTable 20.12 and Fig. 20.49 sum up the features of staging\\nclassification and the overall 5-year survival rate in diseasestage.\\nB. Other Colorectal Malignant Tumours\\nAside from colorectal carcinoma, other malignant tumours\\nwhich are encountered sometimes in the large bowel are\\nleiomyosarcoma (page 737) and malignant lymphoma (page559). Hindgut carcinoids may occur in the rectum and colon(page 576).\\nTUMOURS OF THE ANAL CANAL\\nEpithelial tumours of the anal canal are uncommon and may\\nbe combination of several histological types. Amongst the\\nbenign tumours  of the anal canal, multiple viral warts called\\nas condyloma acuminata are the only tumours of note.Malignant tumours  of the anal canal include the following:\\n1.Squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 20.50)\\n2.

The lining rests onvascularised subserosal fibrous tissue. Other structurestopographically related to peritoneum are retroperitoneum,omentum, mesentery and umbilicus. These structures areinvolved in a variety of pathologic states but a few importantconditions included below are inflammation (peritonitis),tumour-like lesions (idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis andmesenteric cysts) and tumours (primary and metastatic).\\nPERITONITIS\\nInflammatory involvement of the peritoneum may result\\nfrom chemical agents or bacteria.\\n1.Chemical peritonitis  can be caused by the following:\\nBile extravasated due to trauma or diseases of the\\ngallbladder.\\nPancreatic secretions  released from pancreas in acute\\nhaemorrhagic pancreatitis.\\nGastric juice  leaked from perforation of stomach.\\nBarium sulfate  from perforation of bowel during\\nradiographic studies.\\nChemical peritonitis is localised or generalised sterile\\ninflammation of the peritoneum.\\n2.

The fluidmay eventually resolve or may heal by organisation with\\nformation of fibrous adhesions.\\nIDIOPATHIC RETROPERITONEAL FIBROSIS\\nAlso known as Ormond’s disease or sclerosing retro-\\nperitonitis, this rare entity of unknown etiology is characteri-sed by diffuse fibrous overgrowth and chronic inflammation.The condition is, therefore, more like inflammatory rather\\nthan neoplastic in origin.

On the basis of theirpossible origin, they are of various types:\\nChylous cyst  is a thin-walled cyst arising from lymph\\nvessels and lined by endothelium.\\nPseudocysts  are those which are formed following walled-\\noff infection or pancreatitis.\\nNeoplastic cysts  occur due to cystic change in tumours.\\nTUMOURS\\nPeritoneum may be involved in malignant tumours—\\nprimary and metastatic.\\nMesothelioma  is an example of primary peritoneal\\ntumour (benign and malignant) and is similar in morphologyas in pleural cavity (page 505).\\nIntra-abdominal desmoplastic small cell tumour  is a\\nrecently described highly malignant tumour belonging to thegroup of other round cell or blue cell tumours such as smallcell carcinoma lung, Ewing’s sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,neuroblastoma and others.\\nMetastatic peritoneal tumours  are quite common and\\nmay occur from dissemination from any intra-abdominalmalignancy.\\n❑592SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nThe Liver, Biliary Tract and\\nExocrine PancreasChapter 21Chapter 21\\nLIVER\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nANATOMY.  The liver is the largest organ in the body\\nweighing 1400-1600 gm in the males and 1200-1400 gm in\\nthe females. There are 2 main anatomical lobes—right andleft, the right being about six times the size of the left lobe.The right lobe has quadrate lobe on its inferior surface and acaudate lobe on the posterior surface. The right and left lobesare separated anteriorly by a fold of peritoneum called thefalciform ligament,  inferiorly by the fissure for the ligamentum\\nteres,  and posteriorly by the fissure for the ligamentum\\nvenosum  (Fig. 21.1) .\\nThe porta hepatis  is the region on the inferior surface of\\nthe right lobe where blood vessels, lymphatics and commonhepatic duct form the hilum of the liver. A firm smooth layerof connective tissue called Glisson’s capsule encloses the liver\\nand is continuous with the connective tissue of the portahepatis forming a sheath around the structures in the portahepatis. The liver has a double blood supply—the portal veinbrings the venous blood from the intestines and spleen, andthe hepatic artery coming from the coeliac axis suppliesarterial blood to the liver. This dual blood supply providessufficient protection against infarction in the liver. The portalvein and hepatic artery divide into branches to the right andleft lob es in the porta. The right and left hepatic ducts alsojoin in the porta to form the common hepatic duct. The\\nvenous drainage from the liver is into the right and left\\nhepatic veins which enter the inferior vena cava. Lymphatics\\nand the nerve fibres accompany the hepatic artery into theirbranchings and terminate around the porta hepatis.\\nHISTOLOGY. The hepatic parenchyma is composed of\\nnumerous hexagonal or pyramidal classical lobules,  each with\\na diameter of 0.5 to 2 mm. Each classical lobule has a central\\ntributary from the hepatic vein and at the periphery are 4 to5 portal tracts or triads containing branches of bile duct,\\nportal vein and hepatic artery. Cords of hepatocytes and\\nblood-containing sinusoids radiate from the central vein tothe peripheral portal triads. The functioning lobule  or liver\\nacinus  as described by Rappaport has a portal triad in the\\ncentre and is surrounded at the periphery by portions ofseveral classical lobules. However, in most descriptions on\\npathology of the liver, the term lobule  is used in its classical\\nform.\\nThe blood supply to the liver parenchyma flows from\\nthe portal triads to the central veins. Accordingly, the hepatic\\nparenchyma of liver lobule is divided into 3 zones (Fig. 21.2) :\\nZone 1  or the periportal (peripheral) area  is closest to the\\narterial and portal blood supply and hence bears the bruntof all forms of toxic injury.\\nZone  3 or the centrilobular area  surrounds the central vein\\nand is most remote from the blood supply and thus suffers\\nfrom the effects of hypoxic injury.\\nZone 2  is the intermediate midzonal area.Figure 21.1 Anatomy of the liver and its relationship to the\\ngallbladder, pancreas and duodenum.Figure 21.2 Histology of hepatic lobule. The hexagonal or pyramidal\\nstructure with central vein and peripheral 4 to 5 portal triads is termed\\nthe classical lobule. The functional divisions of the lobule into 3 zonesare shown by circles.\\n593CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine PancreasThe hepatocytes  are polygonal cells with a round single\\nnucleus and a prominent nucleolus. The liver cells have a\\nremarkable capability to undergo mitosis and regeneration.Thus it is not uncommon to find liver cells containing morethan one nuclei and having polyploidy up to octoploidy. Ahepatocyte has 3 surfaces: one facing the sinusoid and the\\nspace of Disse, the second  facing the canaliculus, and the third\\nfacing neighbouring hepatocytes.\\nThe blood-containing sinusoids  between cords of hepato-\\ncytes are lined by discontinuous endothelial cells and scatte-red flat Kupffer cells belonging to the reticuloendothelialsystem.\\nThe space of Disse  is the space between hepatocytes and\\nsinusoidal lining endothelial cells. A few scattered fat storingIto cells  lie within the space of Disse.\\nThe portal triad or tract  besides containing portal vein\\nradicle, the hepatic arteriole and bile duct, has a fewmononuclear cells and a scanty connective tissue consideredto be extension of Glisson’s capsule. The portal triads aresurrounded by a limiting plate of hepatocytes.\\nThe intrahepatic biliary system  begins with the bile\\ncanaliculi interposed between the adjacent hepatocytes. Thebile canaliculi are simply grooves between the contactsurfaces of the liver cells and are covered by microvilli. Thesecanaliculi join at the periphery of the lobule to draineventually into terminal bile ducts or ductules (canal ofHering) which are lined by cuboidal epithelium.\\nFUNCTIONS. The liver performs multifold functions. These\\nare briefly listed below:\\n1.Manufacture and excretion of bile.\\n2.Manufacture of several major plasma proteins such as\\nalbumin, fibrinogen and prothrombin.3.\\nMetabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids.\\n4. Storage of vitamins (A, D and B12) and iron.\\n5. Detoxification of toxic substances such as alcohol anddrugs.\\nLIVER FUNCTION  TESTS\\nIn view of multiplicity and complexity of the liver functions,\\nit is obvious that no single test can establish the disturbancein liver function. Thus a battery of liver function tests areemployed for accurate diagnosis, to assess the severity ofdamage, to judge prognosis and to evaluate therapy. Thesetests are described below in relation to major liver functions.A summary of various liver function tests is given inTable 21.1.\\nI.TESTS FOR  MANUF\\nACTURE AND\\nEXCRETION OF BILE\\nBile is produced by the liver, stored in the gallbladder and\\nsecreted via biliary ducts into the duodenum. Bile consistsof biliary phospholipids and primary and secondary bileacids. To understand the mechanisms underlying biliarypathology, it is important to understand normal bilirubinmetabolism (page 596). In brief, jaundice will develop ifbilirubin is excessively produced, or there is impaired hepaticuptake and conjugation of bilirubin, or it is insufficientlyexcreted into the duodenum. Tests employed to assess thesynthesis and elimination of bilirubin pigment, urobilino-gen and bile acids are as follows:\\n1. BILIRUBIN.  Bilirubin pigment can be detected in serum,\\nfaeces and urine.\\ni)Serum bilirubin estimation  is based on van den Bergh\\ndiazo reaction  by spectrophotometric method. Diazo reagent\\nconsists of diazotised sulfanilic acid. Water-soluble conjugated\\nbilirubin gives direct  van den Bergh reaction with diazo\\nreagent within one minute, whereas alcohol-soluble\\nunconjugated  bilirubin is determined by indirect  van den\\nBergh reaction. Addition of alcohol to the reaction mixture\\ngives positive test for both conjugated and unconjugatedbilirubin pigment. The unconjugated bilirubin level is thenestimated by subtracting direct bilirubin value from this totalvalue. The serum of normal adults contains less than 1 mg/dl of total bilirubin, out of which less than 0.25 mg/dl isconjugated bilirubin. Bilirubin level rises in diseases ofhepatocytes, obstruction to biliary excretion into theduodenum, in haemolysis, and defects of hepatic uptake andconjugation of bilirubin  pigment such as in Gilbert’s disease.\\nii)\\nIn faeces,  excretion of bilirubin is assessed by inspection\\nof stools. Clay-coloured stool due to absence of faecal\\nexcretion of the pigment indicates obstructive jaundice.\\niii) In  urine,  conjugated bilirubin can be detected by\\ncommercially available ‘dipsticks’, Fouchet’s test, foam test\\nor ictotest tablet method. Bilirubinuria does not occur innormal subjects nor is unconjugated bilirubin excreted in theurine. Bilirubinuria occurs only when there is raised level ofconjugated bilirubin (filterable). Its excretion depends uponthe level of conjugated bilirubin in plasma that is not protein-bound and is therefore available for glomerular filtration.Bilirubinuria appears in patients of hepatitis before thepatient becomes jaundiced.\\n2. UROBILINOGEN.  Urobilinogen is normally excreted in\\nthe urine. Its semiquantitative estimation in the urine can be\\ndone by preparing dilutions with Ehrlich’s aldehyde reagentor by ‘dipstick’ method. An increase in urobilinogen in theurine is found in hepatocellular dysfunctions such as inalcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis and malignancy of the liver.It is also raised in haemolytic disease and in pyrexia. Incholestatic jaundice due to complete biliary obstruction,urobilinogen disappears from the urine.\\n3. BROMSULPHALEIN EXCRETION.  Bromsulphalein\\n(BSP) is a dye which is removed from circulation by the same\\nmechanisms of binding, conjugation and excretion asbilirubin. BSP is injected intravenously and a sample ofvenous blood 45 minutes later is tested for percentage ofinjected dye remaining in the blood. The test is rarelyperformed nowadays because of the availability of enzymeestimations which are better indicators of hepaticdysfunction. Presently, the only value of BSP excretion testis in the diagnosis of Dubin-Johnson’s syndrome (page 601).\\n4. BILE ACIDS (BILE SALTS).  The primary bile acids\\n(cholic acid and cheno-deoxycholic acid) are formed from\\ncholesterol in the hepatocytes. These bile acids on secretioninto the gut come in contact with colonic bacteria andundergo deconjugation with the production of secondary bile594SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.1: Liver Function Tests.\\nTests Significance\\nI.

Ultrasound examination Cholestasis of various etiologies; SOLs, US-guided-FNAC/liver biopsy\\n2. FNAC and/ or percutaneous liver biopsy Unknown cause of hepatocellular disease, hepatomegaly and\\nsplenomegaly; long-standing hepatitis; PUO and SOLs of the liver\\nacids (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid). Most of these\\nbile acids are reabsorbed through enterohepatic circulationand reach the liver. Only about 10% of the total bile acidsare excreted in the faeces normally as unabsorbable toxiclithocholic acid.Hepatobiliary diseases with cholestasis are associated\\nwith raised levels of serum bile acids which are responsiblefor producing itching (pruritus). These acids are excreted inthe urine by active transport and passive diffusion and canbe detected by simple methods as Hay’s test and ‘dipsticks’.595CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine PancreasII. SERUM ENZYME ASSAYS\\nDetermination of certain serum enzymes is considered useful\\nin various types of liver injury, whether hepatocellular orcholestatic, as well as in quantifying liver damage. Acombination of serum transaminases and alkalinephosphatase estimation is adequate to diagnose liver injury.\\n1. ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE.  Serum alkaline phos-\\nphatase is produced by many tissues, especially bone, liver,\\nintestine and placenta and is excreted in the bile. Most of thenormal serum alkaline phosphatase (range 33-96 U/L) isderived from bone. Elevation in activity of the enzyme canthus be found in diseases of bone, liver and in pregnancy. Inthe absence of bone disease and pregnancy, an elevatedserum alkaline phosphatase levels generally reflecthepatobiliary disease. The greatest elevation (3 to 10 timesnormal) occurs in biliary tract obstruction. Slight to moderateincrease is seen in parenchymal liver diseases such as inhepatitis and cirrhosis and in metastatic liver disease. It ispossible to distinguish serum hepatic alkaline phosphatasefrom bony alkaline phosphatase by fractionation intoisoenzymes but this is not routinely done.\\n2.γ γγ γγ-GLUTAMYL TRANSPEPTIDASE ( γγγ\\n γγ-GT).  The\\nprimary source of the enzyme, γ-GT, in serum is the liver.\\nIts serum level parallels serum alkaline phosphatase and is\\nused to confirm that the elevated serum alkaline phosphataseis of hepatobiliary origin. Besides its elevation in cholestasisand hepatocellular disease, the levels are high in patientswith alcohol abuse even without liver disease.\\n3. TRANSAMINASES (AMINOTRANSFERASES).\\nAssessment of liver cell necrosis is most frequently done byestimation of the following 2 serum enzymes:\\ni)Serum aspartate transaminase or AST (formerly\\nglutamic oxaloacetic transaminase or SGOT):  AST or SGOT\\nis a mitochondrial enzyme released from heart, liver, skeletal\\nmuscle and kidney. Its normal serum level is 0.20-0.65\\nμkat/L (12-38 U/L).\\ni\\ni) Serum alanine transaminase or ALT (formerly glutamic\\npyruvic transaminase or SGPT):  ALT or SGPT is a cytosolic\\nenzyme  primarily present in the liver. Its normal serum level\\nis 0.12-0.70 μkat/L (7-41 U/L).\\nSerum levels of SGOT and SGPT are increased on damage\\nto the tissues producing them. Thus serum estimation ofSGPT (ALT) which is fairly specific for liver tissue is ofgreater value in liver cell injury, whereas SGOT (AST) levelmay rise in acute necrosis or ischaemia of other organs suchas the myocardium, besides liver cell injury.\\nTransaminase estimations are useful in the early\\ndiagnosis of viral hepatitis. Very high levels are seen inextensive acute hepatic necrosis such as in severe viralhepatitis and acute cholestasis. Alcoholic liver disease andcirrhosis are associated with mild to moderate elevation oftransaminases.\\n4. OTHER SERUM ENZYMES.  The determination of a few\\nother serum enzymes is done sometimes but without any\\nextra diagnostic advantage over the above mentionedenzyme assays. These are as under:i)5'-Nucleotidase  is another phosphatase derived from the\\nliver. Its determination is useful to distinguish alkalinephosphatase of hepatic origin from that of bony tissue.\\nii)Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)  is found to be elevated  in\\nserum of patients with metastatic liver involvement.\\niii)Choline esterase  synthesised by the liver is diminished in\\nhepatocellular disease and malnutrition due to impaired\\nsynthesis.\\nIII. TESTS FOR METABOLIC FUNCTIONS\\nThe liver is the principal site of metabolism and synthesis of\\nplasma proteins and amino acids, lipids and lipoproteins,carbohydrates and vitamins, besides detoxification of drugsand alcohol.\\n1. AMINO ACID AND PLASMA PROTEIN META-\\nBOLISM.  Amino acids derived from the diet and from\\ntissue breakdown are metabolised in the liver to ammoniaand urea. A number of plasma proteins and immuno -\\nglobulins are synthesised on polyribosomes bound to therough endoplasmic reticulum within the hepatocytes anddischarged into plasma. Based on these metabolic functionsof the liver, serum estimation of proteins, immunoglobulinsand ammonia and aminoaciduria are employed to assessthe liver cell damage.\\ni)\\nSerum proteins.  Liver cells synthesise albumin,\\nfibrinogen, prothrombin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin,\\nceruloplasmin, transferrin, alpha fetoproteins and acutephase reactant proteins. The blood levels of these plasmaproteins are decreased in extensive liver damage. Routinelyestimated are total concentration of serum proteins (normal6.7 to 8.6 gm/dl), serum albumin (normal 3.5 to 5.5 gm/dl),serum globulin (normal 2 to 3.5 gm/dl) and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio (normal 1.5-3:1). Electrophoresis is usedto determine the proportions of α\\n1, α2, β and γ globulins.\\nDue to the availability of protein electrophoresis, thymolturbidity and flocculation tests based on altered plasmaprotein components have been discontinued.\\nHypoalbuminaemia may occur in liver diseases having\\nsignificant destruction of hepatocytes. Hyperglobulinaemiamay be present in chronic inflammatory disorders such asin cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis.\\nii) Immunoglobulins.  The levels of serum immuno-\\nglobulins produced by lymphocytes and plasma cells (IgG,\\nIgM and IgA) show nonspecific abnormalities in liverdiseases and represent inflammatory or immune responserather than liver cell dysfunction. IgA is the predominantimmunoglobulin in bile and its level is raised in cirrhosis,IgG is markedly raised in chronic active hepatitis and IgMis markedly increased in primary biliary cirrhosis.\\niii)Clotting factors.  Hepatic synthetic function of several\\nclotting factors can be assessed by a few simple coagulation\\ntests. Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time,both of which reflect the activities of various clotting factors,are prolonged in patients with hepatocellular disease.Prothrombin time is dependent upon both hepatic synthesisof clotting factors and intestinal uptake of vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin. Thus, obstruction of the bile duct and intra-596SECTION III Systemic Pathologyhepatic cholestasis which result in vitamin K deficiency due\\nto impaired lipid absorption, are associated with prolongedprothrombin time. However, parenteral injection of vitaminK will normalise prothrombin time if the prolongation wasdue to obstruction, but there will be no improvement inprothrombin time if there is extensive hepatocellular disease.\\niv) Serum ammonia.  High blood levels of ammonia are\\nfound in acute fulminant hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatic\\nencephalopathy. The rise in serum ammonia is due toinability of severely damaged liver to convert ammonia tourea. Thus, urea synthesis is reduced in chronic liver disease.\\n2. LIPID AND LIPOPROTEIN METABOLISM.  Lipids\\nsynthesised in the liver include cholesterol and cholesterol\\nesters, phospholipids and triglycerides. These lipids areinsoluble in water and are carried in circulation with threemajor types of lipoproteins which contain apoproteins. Theseare: high density lipoproteins (HDL), low densitylipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins(VLDL).\\nBlood lipids.  Estimations of total serum cholesterol,\\ntriglycerides and lipoprotein fractions are frequently done\\nin patients with liver disease.\\nThere is rise in total serum cholesterol in cholestasis,\\nprobably due to retention of cholesterol which is normallyexcreted in the bile (normal < 200 mg/dl). Serum triglycerideis also elevated in cholestasis.\\nValues are lowered in acute and chronic diffuse liver\\ndiseases and in malnutrition.\\n3. CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM.  The liver plays a\\ncentral role in carbohydrate metabolism. Blood glucose level\\nis lowered in fulminant acute hepatic necrosis. In chronicliver disease, there is impaired glucose tolerance and relativeinsulin resistance.\\nIV. IMMUNOLOGIC  TESTS\\nLiver diseases are associated with various immunologic\\nabnormalities which may be nonspecific immunologic reac-tions or may be antibodies against specific etiologic agents.\\n1. NONSPECIFIC IMMUNOLOGIC REACTIONS.  These\\ninclude the following:\\ni)Smooth muscle antibody  to actin component of muscle is\\nformed in certain hepatic disorders with hepatic necrosis. It\\nappears that hepatocytes have a protein which isimmunologically similar to actin.\\nii)Mitochondrial antibody  develops in patients with primary\\nbiliary cirrhosis.iii)Antinuclear antibody  is present in some patients of chro-\\nnic hepatitis. The LE cell test may be positive in these cases.\\n2. ANTIBODIES TO SPECIFIC ETIOLOGIC AGENTS.\\nThese vary according to the etiologic agent causing the livercell injury.\\ni)Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)  can be demonstrated\\nin cases of serum hepatitis. A confirmed positive test for\\nHBsAg is definite proof of hepatitis B infection.\\nii)Hepatitis B core  antibody (HBc) can be detected in all\\npatients with hepatitis B.iii)Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg)  can be found in chronic\\nvarieties of hepatitis B.\\niv)Amoeba antibodies  to Entamoeba histolytica develop in\\npatients with amoebic liver abscess.\\nV. ANCILLARY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS\\nIn addition to laboratory tests described above, two ancillary\\ntests which are invariably done by the physician  areultrasonography and percutaneous liver biopsy and/orFNAC.\\n1. ULTRASONOGRAPHY.  Ultrasound (US) examination\\nof the liver is indicated in the following situations:\\ni) Cholestasis of various etiologies to see the dilated intra-\\nand extrahepatic canalicular tree.\\nii) Space-occupying lesions (SOLs) within the liver to\\ndetermine whether they are neoplasms or non-neoplasticcysts.\\niii) To provide US-guidance for FNAC or liver biopsy.\\n2. FNAC AND/OR PERCUTANEOUS LIVER BIOPSY.\\nLastly, FNAC and percutaneous liver biopsy are employedto examine the microscopic changes of hepatic morphologyin various diseases. Both these tests are done after evaluationof signs of obstruction since these tests are contraindicatedin cholestasis. FNAC and liver biopsy are otherwise easilyperformed bedside tests of value. Their main indications areas follows:\\ni)hepatocellular disease of unknown cause;\\nii\\n) suspected cases of chronic hepatitis;\\niii) hepatomegaly of various etiologies;\\niv) splenomegaly of unknown cause;\\nv) fever of unknown cause; andvi) SOLs visualised in radiologic examination\\nJAUNDICE—GENERAL\\nJaundice or icterus refers to the yellow pigmentation of the\\nskin or sclerae by bilirubin (page 42). Bilirubin pigment hashigh affinity for elastic tissue and hence jaundice isparticularly noticeable in tissues rich in elastin content.Jaundice is the result of elevated levels of bilirubin in theblood termed hyperbilirubinaemia. Normal serum bilirubinconcentration ranges from 0.3-1.3 mg/dl, about 80% of whichis unconjugated. Jaundice becomes clinically evident whenthe total serum bilirubin exceeds 2 mg/dl. A rise of serumbilirubin between the normal and 2 mg/dl is generally notaccompanied by visible jaundice and is called latent jaundice.\\nBefore considering the features and types of jaundice, it\\nis essential to review the normal bilirubin metabolism.\\nNORMAL BILIRUBIN METABOLISM\\nNormal metabolism of bilirubin can be conveniently\\ndescribed under 4 main headings—source, transport, hepaticphase and intestinal phase as illustrated schematically earlierin Chapter 12 ( see Fig. 12.9, page 291).\\n1. SOURCE OF BILIRUBIN.  About 80-85% of the bilirubin\\nis derived from the catabolism of haemoglobin present insenescent red blood cells. The destruction of effete597CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreaserythrocytes at the end of their normal lifespan of 120 days\\ntakes place in the reticuloendothelial system in the bonemarrow, spleen and liver. The remaining 15-20% of thebilirubin comes partly from non-haemoglobin haem-containing pigments such as myoglobin, catalase andcytochromes, and partly from ineffective erythropoiesis. Ineither case, haem moiety is formed which is converted tobiliverdin by microsomal haem oxygenase for which oxygenand NADPH are essential requirements. Bilirubin is formedfrom biliverdin by biliverdin reductase.\\n2. TRANSPORT OF BILIRUBIN.  Bilirubin on release from\\nmacrophages circulates as unconjugated bilirubin in plasma\\ntightly bound to albumin. Certain drugs such assulfonamides and salicylates compete with bilirubin foralbumin binding and displace bilirubin from albumin, thusfacilitating bilirubin to enter into the brain in neonates andincrease the risk of kernicterus.  Bilirubin is found in body\\nfluids in proportion to their albumin content such as in CSF,joint effusions, cysts etc.\\n3. HEPATIC PHASE.  On coming in contact with the\\nhepatocyte surface, unconjugated bilirubin is preferentially\\nmetabolised which involves 3 steps: hepatic uptake,conjugation and secretion in bile.\\ni) Hepatic uptake:  Albumin-bound unconjugated bilirubin\\nupon entry into the hepatocyte, is dissociated into bilirubin\\nand albumin. The bilirubin gets bound to cytoplasmic proteinglutathione-S-transferase (GST) (earlier called ligandin) .\\nii) Conjugation:  Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble\\nbut is alcohol-soluble and is converted into water-solublecompound by conjugation. Conjugation occurs inendoplasmic reticulum and involves conversion to bilirubinmono- and diglucuronide by the action of microsomalenzyme, bilirubin- UDP -glucuronosyl transferase (Fig. 21.3) .\\nThe process of conjugation can be induced by drugs likephenobarbital.\\nConjugated bilirubin is bound to albumin in two forms:\\nreversible and irreversible. Reversible binding is similar tothat of unconjugated bilirubin. However, when present inserum for a long time (e.g. in cholestasis, long-standingbiliary obstruction, chronic active hepatitis), conjugatedbilirubin is bound to albumin irreversibly and is termed delta\\nbilirubin  or \\nbiliprotein.  This irreversible conjugated delta\\nbilirubin is not excreted by the kidney, and remainsdetectable in serum for sufficient time after recovery fromthe diseases listed above.\\niii)Secretion into bile:  Conjugated (water-soluble) bilirubin\\nis rapidly transported directly into bile canaliculi by energy-\\ndependent process and then excreted into the bile.\\n4. INTESTINAL PHASE.  Appearance of conjugated\\nbilirubin in the intestinal lumen is followed by either direct\\nexcretion in the stool as stercobilinogen which imparts thenormal yellow colour to stool, or may be metabolised tourobilinogen by the action of intestinal bacteria. Conjugatedbilirubin is normally not reabsorbable whereas its metabolicproduct, urobilinogen, is reabsorbed from the small intestineand reaches enterohepatic circulation. Some of the absorbedurobilinogen in resecreted by the liver into the bile whilethe rest is excreted in the urine as urobilinogen.The major differences between unconjugated and\\nconjugated bilirubin are summarised in Table 21.2.\\nCLASSIFICA TION AND FEA TURES OF JAUNDICE\\nBased on pathophysiology, jaundice may result from one ormore of the following mechanisms:1.\\nIncreased bilirubin production\\n2. Decreased hepatic uptake3. Decreased hepatic conjugation\\n4.\\nDecreased excretion of bilirubin into bile\\nAccordingly, a simple age-old classification of jaundice\\nwas to divide it into 3 predominant types: pre-hepatic\\n(haemolytic), hepatic,  and post-hepatic  cholestatic.  However,\\nhyperbilirubinaemia due to first three mechanisms is mainly\\nunconjugated  while the last variety yields mainly conjugated\\nhyperbilirubinaemia. Hence, currently pathophysiologicclassification of jaundice is based on predominance of thetype of hyperbilirubinaemia. A simple test to determinewhether hyperbilirubinaemia is of unconjugated orconjugated variety is to determine whether bilirubin ispresent in urine or not; its absence in urine suggestsunconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia since unconjugatedFigure 21.3 Schematic representation of hepatic phase of bilirubin\\ntransport.\\n598SECTION III Systemic Pathologybilirubin is not filtered by the glomerulus. The presence of\\nbilirubin in the urine is evidence of conjugated hyper-bilirubinaemia.\\nBased on these mechanisms, the pathogenesis and main\\nfeatures of the two predominant forms of hyperbiliru-binaemia are discussed below (Table 21.3).\\nI.Predominantly Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinaemia\\nThis form of jaundice can result from the following three setsof conditions:1.\\nINCREASED BILIRUBIN PRODUCTION (HAEMO-\\nLYTIC, ACHOLURIC OR PREHEPATIC JAUNDICE).  This\\nresults from excessive red cell destruction as occurs in intra-and extravascular haemolysis or due to ineffectiveerythropoiesis. There is increased release of haemoglobinfrom excessive breakdown of red cells that leads tooverproduction of bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinaemia developswhen the capacity of the liver to conjugate large amount ofbilirubin is exceeded. In premature infants, the liver is defi-cient in enzyme necessary for conjugation while the rate ofred cell destruction is high. This results in icterus neonatorum\\nwhich is particularly severe in haemolytic disease of thenewborn due to maternal isoantibodies (Chapter 13). Sincethere is predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemiain such cases, there is danger of permanent brain damage inthese infants from kernicterus when the serum level ofunconjugated bilirubin exceeds 20 mg/dl.\\nLaboratory data in haemolytic jaundice, in addition to\\npredominant unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, revealnormal serum levels of transaminases, alkaline phosphataseand proteins. Bile pigment being unconjugated type is absentfrom urine (acholuric jaundice). However, there is darkbrown colour of stools due to excessive faecal excretion ofbile pigment and increased urinary excretion of urobilinogen.\\n2. DECREASED HEPATIC UPTAKE.  The uptake of\\nbilirubin by the hepatocyte that involves dissociation of the\\npigment from albumin and its binding to cytoplasmicprotein, GST or ligandin, may be deranged in certainconditions e.g. due to drugs, prolonged starvation and sepsis.\\n3. DECREASED BILIRUBIN CONJUGATION.  This\\nmechanism involves deranged hepatic conjugation due to\\ndefect or deficiency of the enzyme, glucuronosyl transferase.This can occur in certain inherited disorders of the enzyme(e.g. Gilbert’s syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome), oracquired defects in its activity (e.g. due to drugs, hepatitis,cirrhosis). However, hepatocellular damage causes derangedexcretory capacity of the liver more than its conjugatingcapacity (see below).  The physiologic neonatal jaundice is also\\npartly due to relative deficiency of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase in the neonatal liver and is partly as a result ofincreased rate of red cell destruction in neonates.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.2: Major Differences between Unconjugated and Conjugated Bilirubin.\\nFeature Unconjugated Bilirubin Conjugated  Bilirubin\\n1.

Extrahepatic cholestasis (Extrahepatic biliary obstruction)\\n• Mechanical obstruction (e.g. gallstones, inflammatory strictures,\\ncarcinoma head of pancreas, tumours of bile ducts, sclerosing\\ncholangitis, congenital atresia of extrahepatic ducts)599CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine PancreasII. Predominantly Conjugated Hyperbilirubinaemia\\n(Cholestasis)\\nThis form of hyperbilirubinaemia is defined as failure of\\nnormal amounts of bile to reach the duodenum. Morpho-logically, cholestasis means accumulation of bile in liver cellsand biliary passages. The defect in excretion may be withinthe biliary canaliculi of the hepatocyte and in the microscopicbile ducts (intrahepatic cholestasis or medical jaundice),  or there\\nmay be mechanical obstruction to the extrahepatic biliaryexcretory apparatus (extrahepatic cholestasis or obstructive\\njaundice).  It is important to distinguish these two forms of\\ncholestasis since extrahepatic cholestasis or obstructivejaundice is often treatable with surgery, whereas theintrahepatic cholestasis or medical jaundice cannot bebenefitted by surgery but may in fact worsen by theoperation. Prolonged cholestasis of either of the two typesmay progress to biliary cirrhosis (page 625).\\n1. INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS.  Intrahepatic\\ncholestasis is due to impaired hepatic excretion of bile and\\nmay occur from hereditary or acquired disorders.\\ni) Hereditary disorders  producing intrahepatic obstruction\\nto biliary excretion are characterised by ‘pure cholestasis’  e.g.\\nin Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, fibrocystic\\ndisease of pancreas, benign familial recurrent cholestasis,intrahepatic atresia and cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy.\\nii\\n) Acquired disorders  with intrahepatic excretory defect of\\nbilirubin are largely due to hepatocellular diseases and hence\\nare termed ‘hepatocellular cholestasis’  e.g. in viral hepatitis,\\nalcoholic hepatitis, and drug-induced cholestasis such asfrom administration of chlorpromazine and oralcontraceptives.\\nThe  features  of intrahepatic cholestasis include:\\npredominant conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia due toregurgitation of conjugated bilirubin into blood, biliru-binuria, elevated levels of serum bile acids and consequentpruritus, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase,hyperlipidaemia and hypoprothrombinaemia. ‘Pure choles-tasis’ can be distinguished from ‘hepatocellular cholestasis’by elevated serum levels of transaminases in the latter dueto liver cell injury.Liver biopsy  in cases with intrahepatic cholestasis reveals\\nmilder degree of cholestasis than the extrahepatic disorders(Fig. 21.4,A) . The biliary canaliculi of the hepatocytes are\\ndilated and contain characteristic elongated green-brown bile\\nplugs. The cytoplasm of the affected hepatocytes showsfeathery degeneration. Canalicular bile stasis eventuallycauses proliferation of intralobular ductules followed byperiportal fibrosis and produces a picture resembling biliarycirrhosis (page 625).\\n2. EXTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS.  Extrahepatic choles-\\ntasis results from mechanical obstruction to large bile ducts\\noutside the liver or within the porta hepatis. The commoncauses are gallstones, inflammatory strictures, carcinomahead of pancreas, tumours of bile duct, sclerosing cholangitisand congenital atresia of extrahepatic ducts. The obstructionmay be complete and sudden with eventual progressiveobstructive jaundice, or the obstruction may be partial andincomplete resulting in intermittent jaundice.\\nThe features  of extrahepatic cholestasis (obstructive jaun-\\ndice), like in intrahepatic cholestasis, are: predominantconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, bilirubinuria, elevatedserum bile acids causing intense pruritus, high serumalkaline phosphatase and hyperlipidaemia. However, thereare certain features which help to distinguish extrahepaticfrom intrahepatic cholestasis. In obstructive jaundice, thereis malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E and K) andsteatorrhoea resulting in vitamin K deficiency. Prolongedprothrombin time in such cases shows improvementfollowing parenteral administration of vitamin K, whereashypoprothrombinaemia due to hepatocellular disease showsno such improvement in prothrombin time with vitamin Kadministration. The stools of such patients are clay-coloureddue to absence of bilirubin metabolite, stercobilin, in faecesand there is virtual disappearance of urobilinogen from theurine. These patients may have fever due to high incidenceof ascending bacterial infections (ascending cholangitis).\\nLiver biopsy  in cases with extrahepatic cholestasis shows\\nmore marked changes of cholestasis (Fig. 21.4,B) . Since the\\nobstruction is in the extrahepatic bile ducts, there isprogressive retrograde extension of bile stasis intointrahepatic duct system. This results in dilatation of bileFigure 21.4 Salient features in morphology of liver in intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis. A, Intrahepatic cholestasis is characterised by\\nelongated bile plugs in the canaliculi of hepatocytes at the periphery of the lobule. B, Extrahepatic cholestasis shows characteristic bile lakes due\\nto rupture of canaliculi in the hepatocytes in the centrilobular area.\\n600SECTION III Systemic Pathologyducts and rupture of canaliculi with extravasation of bile\\nproducing bile lakes. Since bile is toxic, the regions of bile\\nlakes are surrounded by focal necrosis of hepatocytes. Stasisof bile predisposes to ascending bacterial infections withaccumulation of polymorphs around the dilated ducts(ascending cholangitis). Eventually, there is proliferation ofbile ducts and the appearance may mimic biliary cirrhosis(page 625).\\nNEONATAL JAUNDICE\\nJaundice appears in neonates when the total serum bilirubin\\nis more than 3 mg/dl. It may be the result of unconjugatedor conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia; the former being morecommon. Important causes of neonatal jaundice are listedin Table 21.4.  Some of these conditions are considered below,\\nwhile others are discussed elsewhere in the relevant sections.HEREDITARY NON-HAEMOLYTICHYPERBILIRUBINAEMIAS\\nHereditary non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemias are a small\\ngroup of uncommon familial disorders of bilirubinmetabolism when haemolytic causes have been excluded.The commonest is Gilbert’s syndrome; others are Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor’ssyndrome and benign familial recurrent cholestasis. Thefeatures common to all these conditions are presence oficterus but almost normal liver function tests and no well-defined morphologic changes except in Dubin-Johnsonsyndrome. Gilbert’s syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndromeare examples of hereditary non-haemolytic unconjugated\\nhyperbilirubinaemia, whereas Dubin-Johnson syndrome,\\nRotor’s syndrome and benign familial recurrent cholestasisare conditions with hereditary conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.\\nThese conditions are briefly described below. Theirdistinguishing features are summarised in Table 21.5.\\nGilbert’ s Syndrome\\nThis is the commonest of the familial, genetically-determineddiseases of the liver affecting 2-5% of the population. Gilbert’ssyndrome is characterised by mild, benign, unconjugatedhyperbilirubinaemia (serum bilirubin 1-5 mg/dl) which isnot due to haemolysis. The condition is inherited as anautosomal dominant character. The defect in bilirubinmetabolism is complex and appears to be reduced activityof UDP-glucuronosyl transferase with decreasedconjugation, or an impaired hepatic uptake of bilirubin. Thejaundice is usually mild and intermittent.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  There are no morphologic\\nabnormalities in the liver except some increased lipofuscinpigment in centrilobular hepatocytes. The prognosis ofpatients with Gilbert’s syndrome is excellent, thoughchronic jaundice persists throughout life.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.4: Causes of Neonatal Jaundice.\\nA.

Prognosis Excellent Poor (due to Good Excellent Excellent\\nkernicterus)601CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine PancreasCrigler-Najjar Syndrome\\nCrigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare form of familial non-\\nhaemolytic jaundice with very high unconjugated hyper-\\nbilirubinaemia.  There are 2 forms of this condition: type I and\\ntype II.\\nType I Crigler-Najjar syndrome.  This is inherited as an\\nautosomal recessive disorder. There is complete absence of\\nconjugating enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase in thehepatocytes and hence no conjugated bilirubin is formed.There is extreme elevation of unconjugated bilirubin (usuallymore than 20 mg/dl) with high risk of developing permanentCNS damage from kernicterus. The prognosis is generallyfatal, with death coming from kernicterus usually in the firstyear of life.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  There are no significant\\nmorphologic changes except some canalicular stasis.\\nType II Crigler-Najjar syndrome.  This is inherited as an\\nautosomal dominant disease. There is deficiency of enzymeUDP-glucuronosyl transferase but not complete absence.Thus, unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is generally mildto moderate (usually less than 20 mg/dl). Occurrence ofkernicterus is exceptional and patients respond well tophenobarbital therapy.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  There are no morphologic\\nchanges in the liver.\\nDubin-Johnson Syndrome\\nDubin-Johnson syndrome is autosomal recessive disorder\\ncharacterised by predominant conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia\\n(usually less than 5 mg/dl) with genetic defect in canalicularexcretion of conjugated bilirubin. A prolonged BSP dyeexcretion test is diagnostic of Dubin-Johnson syndrome(page 593).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the condition\\ndiffers from other forms of hereditary hyperbili-rubinaemias in producing greenish-black pigmented liver.Microscopically,  The hepatocytes show dark-brown,\\nmelanin-like pigment in the cytoplasm, the exact natureof which is obscure but it is neither iron nor bile. Unrelatedviral hepatitis mobilises the hepatic pigment of Dubin-Johnson syndrome leading to its excretion in urine butthe pigment reappears after recovery from viral hepatitis.\\nThe disease runs a benign course and does not interfere\\nwith life.\\nRotor’s Syndrome\\nThis is another form of familial conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia\\nwith mild chronic jaundice but differs from Dubin-Johnson\\nsyndrome in having no brown pigment in the liver cells. Thedisease is inherited as an autosomal recessive character. Thedefect probably lies in intrahepatic storage of bilirubin butthe exact protein abnormality is not known.\\nRotor’s syndrome has an excellent prognosis.NEONATAL HEPATITIS\\nNeonatal hepatitis, also termed giant cell hepatitis or\\nneonatal hepatocellular cholestasis, is a general term usedfor the constant morphologic change seen in conjugatedhyperbilirubinaemia as a result of known infectious andmetabolic causes listed in Table 21.4, or may have anidiopathic etiology. ‘Idiopathic’ neonatal hepatitis is morecommon and accounts for 75% of cases. Though all the caseswith either known etiologies or idiopathic type are groupedtogether under neonatal hepatitis, all of them are notnecessarily inflammatory conditions, thus belying theirnomenclature as ‘hepatitis’. The condition usually presentsin the first week of birth with jaundice, bilirubinuria, palestools and high serum alkaline phosphatase.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Irrespective of the etio-\\nlogy, there is morphologic similarity in all these cases. Thehistologic features are as under:1.Loss of normal lobular architecture of the liver.\\n2.\\nPresence of prominent multinucleate giant cells\\nderived from hepatocytes.3. Mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate in the portaltracts with some periportal fibrosis.4. Haemosiderosis.5. Cholestasis in small proliferated ductules in the portaltract and between necrotic liver cells.\\nBILIARY ATRESIAS\\nBiliary atresias, also called as infantile cholangiopathies,  are a\\ngroup of intrauterine developmental abnormalities of the\\nbiliary system. Though they are often classified as congenital,the abnormality of development in most instances isextraneous infection during the intrauterine development orshortly after birth that brings about inflammatory destructionof the bile ducts. The condition may, therefore, have variousgrades of destruction ranging from complete absence of bileducts termed atresia,  to reduction in their number called\\npaucity of bile ducts.\\nDepending upon the portion of biliary system involved,\\nbiliary atresias may be extrahepatic or intrahepatic.\\nExtrahepatic Biliary Atresia\\nThe extrahepatic bile ducts fail to develop normally so that\\nin some cases the bile ducts are absent  at birth, while in others\\nthe ducts may have been formed but start undergoingsclerosis in the perinatal period. It is common to havemultiple defects and other congenital lesions. Extrahepaticbiliary atresia is found in 1 per 10,000 livebirths. Cholestaticjaundice appears by the first week after birth. The baby hassevere pruritus, pale stools, dark urine and elevated serumtransaminases. In some cases, the condition is correctableby surgery, while in vast majority the atresia is not correc-table and in such cases hepatic portoenterostomy (Kasaiprocedure) or hepatic transplantation must be considered.Death is usually due to intercurrent infection, liver failure,and bleeding due to vitamin K deficiency or oesophagealvarices. Cirrhosis and ascites are late complicationsappearing within 2 years of age.602SECTION III Systemic PathologyMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver is\\nenlarged and dark green. The atretic segments of biliary\\nsystem are reduced to cord-like structures.Histologically, the condition must be distinguished from\\nidiopathic neonatal hepatitis as surgical treatment ispossible in extrahepatic biliary atresia but not in the latter.Besides, α-1-antitrypsin deficiency also produces similar\\nappearance in liver biopsy. The main histologic featuresare as under:1. Inflammation and fibrous obliteration of theextrahepatic ducts with absence of bile in them.2. Ductular proliferation and periductular inflammation.3. Cholestasis and bile thrombi in the portal area.4. Periportal fibrosis and later secondary biliary cirrhosis(page 625).5. Transformation of hepatic parenchyma to neonatal(giant cell) hepatitis in 15% of cases.\\nIntrahepatic Biliary Atresia\\nIntrahepatic biliary atresia is characterised by biliary\\nhypoplasia so that there is paucity of bile ducts  rather than\\ntheir complete absence. The condition probably has its originin viral infection acquired during intrauterine period or inthe neonatal period. Cholestatic jaundice usually appearswithin the first few days of birth and is characterised by highserum bile acids with associated pruritus, andhypercholesterolaemia with appearance of xanthomas byfirst year of life. Hepatic as well as urinary copper\\nconcentrations are elevated. In some cases, intrahepatic\\nbiliary atresia is related to α-1-antitrypsin deficiency.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The microscopic features\\nare as follows:1.Paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts.\\n2. Cholestasis.\\n3.\\nIncreased hepatic copper.\\n4. Inflammation and fibrosis in the portal area,eventually leading to cirrhosis.\\nREYE’S SYNDROME\\nReye’s syndrome is defined as an acute postviral syndrome\\nof encephalopathy and fatty change in the viscera. Thesyndrome may follow almost any known viral disease butis most common after influenza A or B and varicella. Viralinfection may act singly, but more often its effect is modifiedby certain exogenous factors such as by administration ofsalicylates, aflatoxins and insecticides. These effects causemitochondrial injury and decreased activity of mitochondrialenzymes in the liver. This eventually leads to rise in bloodammonia and accumulation of triglycerides withinhepatocytes.\\nThe patients are generally children between 6 months and\\n15 years of age. Within a week after a viral illness, the childdevelops intractable vomiting and progressive neurologicaldeterioration due to encephalopathy, eventually leading tostupor, coma and death. Characteristic laboratory findingsare elevated blood ammonia, serum transaminases, bilirubinand prolonged prothrombin time.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly , the liver is enlar-\\nged and yellowish-orange.Microscopically, hepatocytes show small droplets ofneutral fat in their cytoplasm (microvesicular fat). Similarfatty change is seen in the renal tubular epithelium andin the cells of skeletal muscles and heart. The brain showsoedema and sometimes focal necrosis of neurons.\\nHEPATIC FAILURE\\nThough the liver has a marked regenerative capacity and a\\nlarge functional reserve, hepatic failure may develop fromsevere acute and fulminant liver injury with massive necrosisof liver cells (acute hepatic failure),  or from advanced chronic\\nliver disease (chronic hepatic failure). Acute hepatic failure\\ndevelops suddenly with severe impairment of liver functionswhereas chronic liver failure comes insidiously. Theprognosis is much worse in acute hepatic failure than thatin chronic liver failure.\\nETIOLOGY.  Acute and chronic hepatic failure result from\\ndifferent causes:\\nAcute (fulminant) hepatic failure  occurs most frequently\\nin acute viral hepatitis . Other causes are hepatotoxic drug\\nreactions (e.g. anaesthetic agents, nonsteroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs, anti-depressants), carbon tetrachloridepoisoning, acute alcoholic hepatitis, mushroom poisoningand pregnancy complicated with eclampsia.\\nChronic hepatic failure  is most often due to cirrhosis .\\nOther causes include chronic active hepatitis, chroniccholestasis (cholestatic jaundice) and Wilson’s disease.\\nMANIFESTATIONS.  In view of the diverse functions\\nperformed by the liver, the syndrome of acute or chronic\\nhepatic failure produces complex manifestations. The majormanifestations are briefly discussed below anddiagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 21.5 .\\n1. Jaundice.  Jaundice usually reflects the severity of liver\\ncell damage since it occurs due to failure of liver cells tometabolise bilirubin. In acute failure such as in viral hepatitis,jaundice nearly parallels the extent of liver cell damage, whilein chronic failure such as in cirrhosis jaundice appears lateand is usually of mild degree.\\n2.\\nHepatic encephalopathy (Hepatic coma). Neuro-\\npsychiatric syndrome may complicate liver disease of both\\nacute and chronic types. The features include disturbedconsciousness, personality changes, intellectualdeterioration, low slurred speech, flapping tremors, andfinally, coma and death. The genesis of CNS manifestationsin liver disease is by toxic products not metabolised by thediseased liver. The toxic products may be ammonia and othernitrogenous substances from intestinal bacteria which reachthe systemic circulation without detoxification in thedamaged liver and thus damage the brain. Advanced casesof hepatic coma have poor prognosis but may respondfavourably to hepatic transplantation.\\n3. Hyperkinetic circulation.  All forms of hepatic failure are\\nassociated with a hyperkinetic circulation characterised by\\nperipheral vasodilatation, increased splanchnic blood flow603CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasand increased cardiac output. There is increased splenic flow\\nbut reduced renal blood flow resulting in impaired renalcortical perfusion. These changes result in tachycardia, lowblood pressure and reduced renal function.\\n4. Hepatorenal syndrome. The term hepatorenal syndrome\\nis applied to patients of both acute and chronic hepatic failurewho develop renal failure as well, in the absence of clinical,laboratory or morphologic evidence of other causes of renaldysfunction. Hepatorenal syndrome develops in about 10%cases of acute and chronic liver diseases. The acute renalfailure is usually associated with oliguria and uraemia butwith good tubular function. The histology of kidney isvirtually normal, suggesting functional defect for the renalfailure. The pathogenesis of the syndrome is poorlyunderstood but appears to be initiated by effective reductionof the renal blood flow (effective hypovolaemia) as aconsequence of systemic vasodilatation and pooling of bloodin portal circulation. The renal failure in the hepatorenalsyndrome is reversible with improvement in hepaticfunction.\\nDiagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome should be made only\\nafter excluding other causes producing concomitant damageto both the organs, circulatory failure leading to acute tubularnecrosis and other forms of reversible tubular damage.\\n5. Hepatopulmonary syndrome.  The pulmonary changes\\nin chronic hepatic failure such as in cirrhosis consist of\\npulmonary vasodilatation with intra-pulmonaryarteriovenous shunting. This results in ventilation-perfusioninequality that may lead to impaired pulmonary function,clubbing of fingers and sometimes cyanosis.\\n6. Coagulation defects.  Impaired synthesis of a number of\\ncoagulation factors by the diseased liver may result in\\ncoagulation disorders. These include disseminatedintravascular coagulation (consumption coagulopathy),thrombocytopenia and presence of fibrin degradationproducts in the blood.\\n7. Ascites and oedema.  Chronic liver failure due to cirrhosis\\nmay result in portal hypertension and ascites (page 630).\\nDecreased synthesis of albumin by the liver resulting inhypoproteinaemia and consequent fall in plasma oncoticpressure, increased hydrostatic pressure due to portalhypertension and secondary hyperaldosteronism, contributeto the development of ascites and oedema in these patients.\\n8. Endocrine changes.  Endocrine changes may be found in\\nassociation with chronic hepatic failure. The changes are\\nmore common in alcoholic cirrhosis in active reproductivelife. In the male, the changes are towards feminisation suchas gynaecomastia and hypogonadism. In the female, thechanges are less towards masculinisation but atrophy ofgonads and breasts occurs. The underlying mechanismappears to be changed end-organ sensitiveness to sexhormones in cirrhosis.\\n9. Skin changes.  In alcoholic cirrhosis ‘arterial spiders’\\nhaving radiating small vessels from a central arteriole are\\nfrequent in the vascular region drained by superior vena cavasuch as in the neck, face, forearms and dorsum of hands.Less frequently, palmar erythema,  especially in the hypothenar\\nand thenar eminences and on the pulps of the fingers, isobserved in chronic liver disease.\\n10. Foetor hepaticus. A sweetish pungent smell of the breath\\nis found in severe cases of acute and chronic hepatocellulardiseases. It appears to be of intestinal origin, possibly due tofailure of the liver to detoxify  sulfur-containing substancesabsorbed from the gut.\\nCIRCULATORY DISTURBANCES\\nVascular disorders of general nature involving the liver such\\nas chronic passive congestion and infarction have alreadybeen discussed in Chapter 5. Hepatic and portal venousobstruction and hepatic arterial obstruction are consideredhere.\\nI. HEPATIC VENOUS OBSTRUCTION\\nThe central veins of lobules of the liver are tributaries of the\\nhepatic veins. In the normal liver, there are no anastomosesbetween hepatic vein and portal vein but in cirrhotic liverthere are such anastomoses. Normal pressure in the freehepatic vein is about 6 mmHg.\\nTwo uncommon diseases produced by obstruction of the\\nhepatic veins are Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic veinthrombosis) and hepatic veno-occlusive disease.\\nBudd-Chiari Syndrome (Hepatic Vein Thrombosis)\\nBudd-Chiari syndrome in its pure form consists of slowly\\ndeveloping thrombosis of the hepatic veins and the adjacentinferior vena cava, while some workers include hepatic veno-occlusive disease (described below) in this syndrome.\\nETIOLOGY.  The etiology of hepatic venous thrombosis in\\nabout a third of cases is unknown (idiopathic), while in the\\nFigure 21.5 Complications of hepatic failure.\\n604SECTION III Systemic Pathologyremaining cases various causes associated with increased\\nthrombotic tendencies are attributed to polycythaemia vera,paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, oral contraceptives,pregnancy, postpartum state, intra-abdominal cancers (e.g.hepatocellular carcinoma), chemotherapy, radiation andmyeloproliferative diseases. Formation of membranouswebs, probably congenital or as a consequence of organisedthrombosis, in the suprahepatic portion of inferior vena cavais another important cause.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the liver is enlar-\\nged, swollen, red-purple and has a tense capsule.Histologically, the changes in sudden hepatic vein\\nocclusion are those of centrilobular congestion, necrosisand rupture of sinusoids into the space of Disse. In slowlydeveloping thrombosis, the changes are more chronic andinclude fibrosing reaction in the centrilobular zone thatmay progress to cardiac cirrhosis.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Budd-Chiari syndrome is clinically\\ncharacterised by either an acute form or chronic formdepending upon the speed of occlusion.\\nIn the acute form,  the features are abdominal pain,\\nvomiting, enlarged liver, ascites and mild icterus.\\nIn the more usual chronic form,  the patients present with\\npain over enlarged tender liver, ascites and other features ofportal hypertension.\\nThe acute form of illness leads to acute hepatic failure\\nand death, whereas in chronic form the patient may live for\\nmonths to a few years.\\nHepatic Veno-occlusive Disease\\nHepatic veno-occlusive disease consists of intimal thickening,\\nstenosis and obliteration of the terminal central veins andmedium-sized hepatic veins. The venous occlusion resultsin pathologic changes similar to those of Budd-Chiarisyndrome and can be distinguished from the latter bydemonstration of absence of thrombosis in the major hepaticveins.\\nThe cause and stimulus for hepatic veno-occlusive\\ndisease are obscure. The condition is more widespread incountries such as Africa, India and certain other tropicalcountries where ‘bush tea’ (medicinal tea) is consumed thatcontains hepatotoxic alkaloids. The disease has also beenfound in association with administration of antineoplasticdrugs and immunosuppressive therapy.\\nII. PORTAL VENOUS OBSTRUCTION\\nObstruction of the portal vein may occur within the\\nintrahepatic course or in extrahepatic site.\\nIntrahepatic cause  of portal venous occlusion is hepatic\\ncirrhosis as the commonest and most important, followed indecreasing frequency by tumour invasion, congenital hepaticfibrosis and schistosomiasis.\\nExtrahepatic causes  of portal vein obstruction are intra-\\nabdominal cancers, intra-abdominal sepsis, direct invasionby tumour, myeloproliferative disorders and upperabdominal surgical procedure followed by thrombosis.The effects  of portal venous obstruction depend upon\\nthe site of obstruction. The most important effect, irrespectiveof the site of occlusion or cause, is portal hypertension andits manifestations (page 630). If the obstruction is in theextrahepatic portal vein along with extension of occlusioninto splenic vein, it may result in venous infarction of thebowel. Pylephlebitis may be followed by multiple pyaemicliver abscesses.\\nPeliosis Hepatis\\nAlthough sinusoidal dilatation can occur secondary to many\\nliver diseases, peliosis hepatis is an uncommon condition ofprimary sinusoidal dilatation that results in blockage of bloodoutflow and may result in massive intraperitonealhaemorrhage. Although exact etiology is not known, peliosishepatis and another related condition, bacillary angiomatosis(page 413), have been found to occur in HIV-infected patientswhose CD4+ T cell counts fall below 100/ μl.  Opportunistic\\ninfection with Bartonella henselae  in poor hygienic conditions\\nin these cases results in blood-filled cysts in liver partly linedby endothelial cells and having mixed inflammatory cells ina fibromyxoid background.\\nEtiologic association of peliosis hepatis with consumption\\nof anabolic steroids and oral contraceptives has also beensuggested and is self-limiting with withdrawal of theoffending agent.\\nIII. HEPATIC ARTERIAL OBSTRUCTION\\nDiseases from obstruction of the hepatic artery are\\nuncommon. Rarely, accidental ligation of the main hepaticartery or its branch to right lobe may be followed by fatalinfarction. Obstruction of the small intrahepatic arterialbranches usually does not produce any effects because ofgood collateral circulation.\\nLIVER CELL NECROSIS\\nAll forms of injury to the liver such as microbiologic, toxic,\\ncirculatory or traumatic, result in necrosis of liver cells. Theextent of involvement of hepatic lobule in necrosis varies.Accordingly, liver cell necrosis is divided into 3 types: diffuse\\n(submassive to massive), zonal  and focal.\\n1. DIFFUSE (SUBMASSIVE TO MASSIVE) NECROSIS.When there is extensive and diffuse necrosis of the liverinvolving all the cells in groups of lobules, it is termeddiffuse, or submassive to massive necrosis. It is mostcommonly caused by viral hepatitis or drug toxicity.\\n2. ZONAL NECROSIS.  Zonal necrosis is necrosis of\\nhepatocytes in 3 different zones of the hepatic lobule (page\\n592). Accordingly, it is of 3 types; each type affectingrespective zone is caused by different etiologic factors:\\ni)Centrilobular necrosis  is the commonest type involving\\nhepatocytes in zone 3 (i.e. located around the central vein).\\nCentrilobular necrosis is characteristic feature of ischaemicinjury such as in shock and CHF since zone 3 is farthest fromthe blood supply. Besides, it also occurs in poisoning withchloroform, carbon tetrachloride and certain drugs.605CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasii) Midzonal necrosis  is uncommon and involves zone 2 of\\nthe hepatic lobule. This pattern of necrosis is seen in yellow\\nfever and viral hepatitis. In viral hepatitis, some of the\\nnecrosed hepatocytes of the mid-zone are transformed into\\nacidophilic, rounded Councilman bodies.\\niii)Periportal (peripheral) necrosis  is seen in zone 1\\ninvolving the parenchyma closest to the arterial and portal\\nblood supply. Since zone 1 is most well perfused, it is mostvulnerable to the effects of circulating hepatotoxins e.g. inphosphorus poisoning and eclampsia.\\n3. FOCAL NECROSIS.  This form of necrosis involves small\\ngroups of hepatocytes irregularly distributed in the hepatic\\nlobule. Focal necrosis is most often caused by microbiologic\\ninfections. These include viral hepatitis, miliary tuberculosis,typhoid fever and various other forms of bacterial, viral andfungal infections. Focal necrosis may also occur in drug-induced hepatitis.\\nVIRAL HEPATITIS\\nThe term viral hepatitis is used to describe infection of the\\nliver caused by hepatotrop ic viruses. Currently there are 5\\nmain varieties of these viruses and a sixth poorly-\\ncharacterised virus, causing distinct types of viral hepatitis:\\nHepatitis A virus (HAV),  causing a faecally-spread self-\\nlimiting disease.Hepatitis B virus (HBV),  causing a parenterally transmitted\\ndisease that may become chronic.\\nHepatitis C virus (HCV),  previously termed non-A, non-B\\n(NANB) hepatitis virus involved chiefly in transfusion-related hepatitis.\\nHepatitis delta virus (HDV)  which is sometimes associated\\nas superinfection with hepatitis B infection.\\nHepatitis E virus (HEV),  causing water-borne infection.\\nHepatitis G virus (HGV),  is a recently discovered\\ntransfusion-transmitted hepatotropic virus but is not knownto cause hepatitis.\\nAll these human hepatitis viruses are RNA viruses except\\nHBV which is a DNA virus.\\nThough a number of other viral diseases such as infection\\nwith Epstein-Barr virus (in infectious mononucleosis),arbovirus (in yellow fever), cytomegalovirus, herpes simplexand several others affect the liver but the changes producedby them are nonspecific; the term ‘viral hepatitis’ is strictlyapplied to infection of the liver by the hepatitis viruses.\\nETIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION\\nBased on the etiologic agent, viral hepatitis is currently\\nclassified into 6 etiologic types—hepatitis A, hepatitis B,hepatitis C, hepatitis D, hepatitis E and hepatitis G. Thecontrasting features of major types are presented inTable 21.6.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.6: Features of Various Types of Hepatitis Viruses.\\nFeature Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Hepatitis D Hepatitis E\\n1.

Hepatitis A isusually a benign, self-limiting disease and has an incubationperiod of 15-45 days. The disease occurs in epidemic formas well as sporadically. It is usually spread by faeco-oralroute. Parenteral transmission is extremely rare. The spreadis related to close personal contact such as in overcrowding,poor hygiene and poor sanitation. Most frequently affectedage is 5-14 years; adults are often infected by spread fromchildren.\\nHEPATITIS A VIRUS (HAV) . The etiologic agent for\\nhepatitis A, HAV, is a small, 27 nm diameter, icosahedral\\nnon-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. Viral genomehas been characterised but only a single serotype has beenidentified. HAV infection can be transmitted to primates andthe virus can be cultivated in vitro.  Inactivation of viral\\nactivity can be achieved by boiling for 1 minute, by ultravioletradiation, or by contact with formaldehyde and chlorine. Thevirus is present in the liver cells, bile, stool and blood duringthe incubation period and in pre-icteric phase but viralshedding diminishes after the onset of jaundice. Chroniccarriers have not been identified for HAV infection.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The mechanism by which HAV infection\\ncauses hepatitis A is poorly understood. An immunologic\\nbasis is suspected but the evidence in support is indirect inthe form of immunologic markers but not direct demons-tration of the etiologic agent in the affected hepatocytes.These markers are as follows (Fig. 21.6) :\\n1.IgM anti-HAV antibody  appears in the serum at the onset\\nof symptoms of acute hepatitis A.\\n2.IgG anti-HAV antibody  is detected in the serum after acute\\nillness and remains detectable indefinitely. It gives life-long\\nprotective immunity against reinfection with HAV.\\nHepatitis B\\nHepatitis B (serum hepatitis) caused by HBV infection has a\\nlonger incubation period (30-180 days) and is transmittedparenterally such as in recipients of blood and bloodproducts, intravenous drug addicts, patients treated by renaldialysis and hospital workers exposed to blood, and byintimate physical contact such as from mother to child andby sexual contact. The disease may occur at any age. HBVinfection causes more severe form of illness that includes:acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis, progression to cirrhosis,fulminant hepatitis and an asymptomatic carrier stage. HBVplays some role in the development of hepatocellularcarcinoma as discussed later (page 634).\\nHEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) . The etiologic agent for\\nhepatitis B, HBV, is a DNA virus which has been extensively\\nstudied. Electron microscopic studies on serum of patientsinfected with HBV show 3 forms of viral particles of 2 sizes:small (spheres and tubules/filaments) and large (spheres)as under:\\ni) Small particles  are most numerous and exist in two forms—\\nas 22 nm  spheres, and as tubules  22 nm in diameter and\\n100 nm long. These are antigenically identical to envelope\\nprotein of HBV and represent excess of viral envelope proteinreferred as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).\\nii) Large particles,  42 nm in diameter,  are double-shelled\\nspherical particles, also called as  Dane particles . These are\\nabout 100 to 1000 times less in number in serum compared\\nto small 22 nm particles and represent intact virion of HBV.\\nThe genomic structure of HBV is quite compact and\\ncomplex. The HBV DNA consists of 4 overlapping geneswhich encode for multiple proteins (Fig 21.7) :\\n1. S gene codes for the surface envelope protein, hepatitis B\\nsurface antigen (HBsAg); this protein product is termed major\\nprotein . HBsAg is present on the outer surface of the large\\nspherical particles as well as in small spherical and tubularstructures. Pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions of genome are upstream\\nof S gene and code for pre-S gene protein products thatincludes receptor on the HBV surface and for hepatocytemembrane proteins. The protein product of S-gene plus\\nFigure 21.6 Sequence of appearance of antibodies to HAV.\\nFigure 21.7 Genomic structure of hepatitis B virus (Dane particle).\\n607CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasadjacent pre-S2 region is the middle protein , while the protein\\nproducts of pre-S1 plus pre-S2 regions is the large protein .\\nLarge protein coming from both pre-S proteins is rich in\\ncomplete virions.\\n2. P gene  is the largest and codes for DNA polymerase.\\n3. C gene  codes for two nucleocapsid proteins, HBeAg and a\\ncore protein termed HBcAg.\\n4. X gene codes for HBxAg which is a small non-particulate\\nprotein. HbxAg has a role in transactivation the transcription\\nof both viral and cellular genes. The processes transactivatedby X-genes include signal-transduction pathways, increasedreplication of HBV DNA, replication of other virusesincluding HIV, enhanced susceptibility of HBV-infectedhepatocytes to cytolytic T cells, and pro-apoptotic pathway.Expression of HbxAg and its antibodies associated withenhanced HBV DNA replication has been implicated inhepatocelluar carcinoma in patients of chronic hepatitis.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The evidence linking immuno-\\npathogenetic mechanism with hepatocellular damage is\\nmuch stronger in HBV infection than with HAV infection.In support of immune pathogenesis is the demonstration ofseveral immunological markers (serologic as well as viral),and molecular and morphologic evidence that hepatocyticdamage is initiated by virus-infected CD8+T cytotoxic cells.\\nSerologic and viral markers.  Various immunological markers\\nindicative of presence of HBV infection can be demonstrated\\nin the sera as well as in the hepatocytes of infectedindividuals. These are as under (Fig. 21.8) :\\n1. HBsAg.  In 1965, Blumberg and colleagues in Philadelphia\\nfound a lipoprotein complex in the serum of a multiple-transfused haemophiliac of Australian aborigine which wassubsequently shown by them to be associated with serumhepatitis. This antigen was termed Australia antigen  by them\\n(In 1977, Blumberg was awarded the Nobel prize for hisdiscovery). The term Australia antigen is now usedsynonymous with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).HBsAg appears early in the blood after about 6 weeks ofinfection and its detection is an indicator of active HBVinfection. It usually disappears in 3-6 months. Its persistencefor more than 6 months implies a carrier state. HBsAg mayalso be demonstrated in the cell membrane of hepatocytesof carriers and chronic hepatitis patients by Orcein staining\\n(orange positivity) but not in the hepatocytes during acutestage of illness.\\n2.Anti-HBs.  Specific antibody to HBsAg in serum called\\nanti-HBs appears late, about 3 months after the onset. Anti-\\nHBs response may be both IgM and IgG type. The prevalencerate of anti-HBs ranges from 10-15%. In these individuals itpersists for life providing protection against reinfection withHBV.\\n3 \\n. HBeAg.  HBeAg derived from core protein is present\\ntransiently (3-6 weeks) during an acute attack. Its persistence\\nbeyond 10 weeks is indicative of development of chronic liverdisease and carrier state.\\n4. Anti-HBe.  Antibody to HBeAg called anti-HBe appears\\nafter disappearance of HBeAg. Seroconversion from HBeAgto anti-HBe during acute stage of illness is a prognostic sign\\nfor resolution of infection.\\n5. HBcAg.  HBcAg derived from core protein cannot be\\ndetected in the blood. But HBcAg can be demonstrated in\\nthe nuclei of hepatocytes in carrier state and in chronichepatitis patients by Orcein staining but not in the liver cellsduring acute stage.\\n6. Anti-HBc.  Antibody to HBcAg called anti-HBc can,\\nhowever, be detected in the serum of acute hepatitis B\\npatients during pre-icteric stage. Anti-HBc may be IgM orIgG class antibody. IgM anti-HBc persists for 4-6 months andis followed later by IgG anti-HBc. Thus detection of high titreof IgM anti-HBc is indicative of recent acute HBV infection,while elevated level of IgG anti-HBc suggests HBV infectionin the remote past.\\n7. HBV-DNA.  Detection of HBV-DNA by molecular\\nhybridisation using the Southern blot technique is the most\\nsensitive index of hepatitis B infection. It is present in pre-symptomatic phase and transiently during early acute stage.\\nHepatitis D\\nInfection with delta virus (HDV) in the hepatocyte nuclei of\\nHBsAg-positive patients is termed hepatitis D. HDV is adefective virus for which HBV is the helper. Thus, hepatitisD develops when there is concomitant hepatitis B infection.HDV infection and hepatitis B may be simultaneous (co-\\ninfection),  or HDV may infect a chronic HBsAg carrier\\n(superinfection) (Fig. 21.9) :\\nWith  coinfection,  acute hepatitis D may range from mild\\nto fulminant hepatitis but fulminant hepatitis is more likelyin such simultaneous delta infection. Chronicity rarelydevelops in coinfection.\\nWith  superinfection  (incubation period 30-35 days),\\nchronic HBV infection gets worsened indicated byappearance of severe and fulminant acute attacks,progression of carrier stage to chronic delta hepatitis oracceleration towards cirrhosis. Occurrence of hepatocellularcarcinoma is, however, less common in HBsAg carriers withHDV infection.Figure 21.8 Sequence of serologic and viral markers in acute\\nhepatitis B.\\n608SECTION III Systemic PathologyHDV infection is worldwide in distribution though the\\nincidence may vary in different countries. Endemic regions\\nare Southern Europe, Middle-East, South India and parts ofAfrica. The high-risk individuals for HDV infection are thesame as for HBV infection i.e. intravenous drug abusers,homosexuals, transfusion recipients, and health careworkers.\\nHEPATITIS DELTA VIRUS (HDV).  The etiologic agent,\\nHDV, is a small single-stranded RNA particle with a\\ndiameter of 36 nm. It is double-shelled—the outer shellconsists of HBsAg and the inner shell consists of delta antigenprovided by a circular RNA strand. It is highly infectiousand can induce hepatitis in any HBsAg-positive host. HDVreplication and proliferation takes place within the nuclei ofliver cells. Markers for HDV infection include the following:\\n1.HDV identification  in the blood and in the liver cell nuclei.\\n2.HDAg  detectable in the blood and on fixed liver tissue\\nspecimens.3.Anti-HD antibody  in acute hepatitis which is initially IgM\\ntype and later replaced by IgG type anti-HD antibody which\\npersists for life to confer immunity against reinfection.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  HDV, unlike HBV, is thought to cause\\ndirect cytopathic effect on hepatocytes. However, there are\\nexamples of transmission of HDV infection from individualswho themselves have not suffered from any attack ofhepatitis, suggesting that it may not be always cytopathic.Thus, the exact mechanism remains unresolved.\\nHepatitis C\\nThe diagnosis of a third major category of hepatitis was\\nearlier made after exclusion of infection with other knownhepatitis viruses and was initially designated non-A, non-B(NANB) hepatitis. However, now this third type has beencharacterised and is called hepatitis C.\\nHepatitis C infection is acquired by blood transfusions,\\nblood products, haemodialysis, parenteral drug abuse andaccidental cuts and needle-pricks in health workers. About90% of post-transfusion hepatitis is of hepatitis C type. About1-2% of volunteer blood donors and up to 5% of professionalblood donors are carriers of HCV. Hepatitis C has anincubation period of 20-90 days (mean 50 days). Clinically,acute HCV hepatitis is milder than HBV hepatitis but HCVhas a higher rate of progression to chronic hepatitis thanHBV. Persistence of infection and chronic hepatitis are thekey features of HCV. Occurrence of cirrhosis after 5 to 10years and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma are otherlate consequences of HCV infection. Currently, HCV isconsidered more important cause of chronic liver diseaseworldwide than HBV.\\nHEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV) . HCV is a single-stranded,\\nenveloped RNA virus, having a diameter of 30-60 nm. HCV\\ngenome has about 3000 amino acids. The genomicorganisation of HCV shows a 5’ terminal end, C (capsid)region  and the envelope regions E1 and E2 in the exons(Fig. 21.10) .\\nThe viral proteins result in corresponding serologic and\\nvirologic markers for HCV infection as under (Fig. 21.11) :\\n1.Anti-HCV antibodies.  Three generations of anti-HCV IgG\\nassays are available:\\ni) First generation antibodies are against C100-3 region\\nproteins and appear 1 to 3 months after infection. Figure 21.9 Consequences of coinfection versus superinfection in combined HDV-HBV infection.\\nFigure 21.10 Diagrammatic structure of hepatitis C virus.\\n609CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasii) Second generation antibodies are against C200 and C33c\\nproteins and appear about one month earlier than the\\nfirst generation.\\niii) Third generation antibodies are against C22-3 and NS-5\\nregion proteins and are detected even earlier.\\n2.HCV-RNA.  HCV infection is, however, confirmed by\\nHCV-RNA employing PCR technique which can be detectedwithin a few days after exposure to HCV infection, muchbefore appearance of anti-HCV and persists for the durationof HCV infection.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Cell-mediated immune mechanism and\\nproduction of antiviral cytokines by T-lymphocytes certainly\\nplay a role in hepatocytic injury due to HCV. HCV virionshave not been identified in hepatocytes. Perhaps, HCVinfection of lymphoid cells may induce immunologic injuryto hepatocytes. In patients with chronic HCV hepatitis, HCV-specific CD4+ T cells and HLA-restricted CD8+ T cells havebeen identified. Crossreactivity between viral antigens andhost autoantibodies to liver-kidney microsomal antigen (anti-LKM) have been reported in a subset of patients that explainsthe association of autoimmune hepatitis and HCV hepatitis.\\nHepatitis E\\nHepatitis E is an enterically-transmitted virus, previously\\nlabelled as epidemic or enterically transmitted variant of non-A non-B hepatitis. The infection occurs in young or middle-aged individuals, primarily seen in India, other Asiancountries, Africa and central America.\\nThe infection is generally acquired by contamination of\\nwater supplies such as after monsoon flooding. However,compared with HAV, secondary person-to-person infectiondoes not occur with HEV. Thus HEV has some commonepidemiologic features with HAV. HEV infection has aparticularly high mortality in pregnant women but isotherwise a self-limited disease and has not been associatedwith chronic liver disease.\\nHEPATITIS E VIRUS (HEV).  HEV is a single-stranded 32-\\n34 nm, icosahedral non-enveloped virus. The virus has beenisolated from stools, bile and liver of infected persons.\\nSerologic markers for HEV include the following:\\n1.Anti-HEV antibodies of both IgM and IgG class.\\n2. HEV-RNA.\\nHowever, testing for these markers for HEV is currently\\nnot available.\\nHepatitis G\\nA virus distinct from the foregoing hepatitis viruses has been\\ndesignated separately as hepatitis G (HGV). HGV infectionhas been found in blood donors, patients on haemodialysisand as coinfection with HIV. However, unlike HCV, HGV iscleared from the plasma in majority of individuals while asmall percentage of cases have chronic HGV infection whodo not develop hepatitis, nor does infected blood requirescreening for HGV RNA.\\nHEPATITIS G VIRUS (HGV).  HGV is a single-stranded\\nRNA virus. The virus has been identified by PCR ampli-\\nfication technique.\\nCLINICOP\\nATHOLOGIC SPECTRUM\\nAmong the various etiologic types of hepatitis, evidence\\nlinking HBV and HCV infection with the spectrum of clinico-pathologic changes is stronger than with other hepatotropicviruses. The typical pathologic changes of hepatitis by majorhepatotropic viruses are virtually similar. HAV and HEV,however, do not have a carrier stage nor cause chronichepatitis. The various clinical patterns and pathologicconsequences of different hepatotropic viruses can beconsidered under the following headings:i)Carrier state\\nii)\\nAsymptomatic infection\\niii) Acute hepatitisiv) Chronic hepatitisv) Fulminant hepatitis (Submassive to massive necrosis)\\nIn addition, progression to cirrhosis (page 624) and\\nassociation with hepatocellular carcinoma (page 634) areknown to occur in certain types of hepatitis which arediscussed separately later.\\nI. Carrier State\\nAn asymptomatic individual without manifest disease,\\nharbouring infection with hepatotropic virus and capable oftransmitting it is called carrier state. There can be 2 types ofcarriers:\\n1. An ‘asymptomatic healthy carrier’  who does not suffer from\\nill-effects of the virus infection but is capable of transmitting.\\n2.An ‘asymptomatic carrier with chronic disease’ capable of\\ntransmitting the organisms.\\nAs stated before, hepatitis A and E do not produce the\\ncarrier state. Hepatitis B is responsible for the largest number\\nof carriers in the world, while concomitant infection withHDV more often causes progressive disease rather than anasymptomatic carrier state. There is geographic variation inincidence of HBV carrier state: while in normal populationin US and western Europe it is less than 0.5%, its prevalenceFigure 21.11 Sequence of serologic and viral markers of HCV\\ninfection.\\n610SECTION III Systemic Pathologyis much higher in Asian and tropical countries (5-20%). An\\nestimated 2-3% of the general population are asymptomaticcarriers of HCV. Data on HBV carrier state reveal role of 2important factors rendering the individual more vulnerableto harbour the organisms—e arly age at infection and impaired\\nimmunity.  Whereas approximately 10% of adults contracting\\nhepatitis B infection develop carrier state, 90% of infectedneonates fail to clear HBsAg from the serum within 6 monthsand become HBV carriers.\\nClinical recognition of carrier state of HBV is more\\nfrequently done by detection of HBsAg in the serum and lessoften by other markers such as HBeAg, HBcAg andantibodies. Concomitant infection of HDV with HBVdepends upon the demonstration of anti-HD.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Carriers of HBV may or\\nmay not show changes on liver biopsy.\\nHealthy HBV carriers  may show no changes or minor\\nhepatic change such as presence of finely granular,ground-glass, eosinophilic cytoplasm as evidence ofHBsAg.\\nAsymptomatic carriers with chronic disease  may show\\nchanges of chronic hepatitis and even cirrhosis.\\nII. Asymptomatic Infection\\nThese are cases who are detected incidentally to have\\ninfection with one of the hepatitis viruses as revealed by theirraised serum transaminases or by detection of the presenceof antibodies but are otherwise asymptomatic.\\nIII. Acute Hepatitis\\nThe most common consequence of all hepatotropic viruses\\nis acute inflammatory involvement of the entire liver. Ingeneral, type A, B, C, D and E run similar clinical courseand show identical pathologic findings.\\nClinically, acute hepatitis is categorised into 4 phases:\\nincubation period, pre-icteric phase, icteric phase and post-icteric phase.1. Incubation period:  It varies among different hepatotropic\\nviruses: for hepatitis A it is about 4 weeks (15-45 days); for\\nhepatitis B the average is 10 weeks (30-180 days); for hepatitis\\nD about 6 weeks (30-50 days); for hepatitis C the mean\\nincubation period is about 7 weeks (20-90 days), and forhepatitis E it is 2-8 weeks (15-60 days). The patient remainsasymptomatic during incubation period but the infectivityis highest during the last days of incubation period.\\n2. Pre-icteric phase:  This phase is marked by prodromal\\nconstitutional symptoms that include anorexia, nausea,\\nvomiting, fatigue, malaise, distaste for smoking, arthralgiaand headache. There may be low-grade fever preceding the\\nonset of jaundice, especially in hepatitis A. The earliest\\nlaboratory evidence of hepatocellular injury in pre-icteric\\nphase is the elevation of transaminases.\\n3. Icteric phase:  The prodromal period is heralded by the\\nonset of clinical jaundice and the constitutional symptoms\\ndiminish. Other features include dark-coloured urine due tobilirubinuria, clay-coloured stools due to cholestasis, pruritusas a result of elevated serum bile acids, loss of weight andabdominal discomfort due to enlarged, tender liver. The\\ndiagnosis is based on deranged liver function tests (e.g.\\nelevated levels of serum bilirubin, transaminases andalkaline phosphatase; prolonged prothrombin time andhyperglobulinaemia) and serologic detection of hepatitisantigens and antibodies.\\n4.Post-icteric phase : The icteric phase lasting for about 1\\nto 4 weeks is usually followed by clinical and biochemical\\nrecovery in 2 to 12 weeks. The recovery phase is moreprolonged in hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Up to 1% cases of\\nacute hepatitis may develop severe form of the disease\\n(fulminant hepatitis); and 5-10% of cases progress on tochronic hepatitis. Evolution into the carrier state (except in\\nHAV and HEV infection) has already been described above.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly , the liver is\\nslightly enlarged, soft and greenish.\\nHistologically , the changes are as follows (Fig. 21.12) :Figure 21.12 Acute viral hepatitis. The predominant histologic changes are: variable degree of necrosis of hepatocytes, most marked in zone\\n3 (centrilobular); and mononuclear cellular infiltrate in the lobule. Mild degree of liver cell necrosis is seen as ballooning degeneration while\\nacidophilic Councilman bodies (inbox) are indicative of more severe liver cell injury.\\n611CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas1. Hepatocellular injury:  There may be variation in the\\ndegree of liver cell injury but it is most marked in zone 3\\n(centrilobular zone):\\ni) Mildly injured hepatocytes appear swollen with\\ngranular cytoplasm which tends to condense around thenucleus (ballooning degeneration).\\nii) Others show acidophilic degeneration in which thecytoplasm becomes intensely eosinophilic, the nucleusbecomes small and pyknotic and is eventually extrudedfrom the cell, leaving behind necrotic, acidophilic masscalled Councilman body  or acidophil body by the process\\nknown as apoptosis.\\niii)Another type of hepatocellular necrosis is dropout\\nnecrosis  in which isolated or small clusters of hepatocytes\\nundergo lysis.iv)Bridging necrosis  is a more severe form of hepato-\\ncellular injury in acute viral hepatitis and may progress\\nto fulminant hepatitis or chronic hepatitis (discussedbelow). Bridging necrosis is characterised by bands ofnecrosis linking portal tracts to central hepatic veins, onecentral hepatic vein to another, or a portal tract to anothertract.\\n2. Inflammatory infiltrate:  There is infiltration by\\nmononuclear inflammatory cells, usually in the portal\\ntracts, but may permeate into the lobules.\\n3. Kupffer cell hyperplasia:  There is reactive hyper-\\nplasia of Kupffer cells many of which contain phago-\\ncytosed cellular debris, bile pigment and lipofuscingranules.\\n4. Cholestasis:  Biliary stasis is usually not severe in viral\\nhepatitis and may be present as intracytoplasmic bile\\npigment granules.\\n5. Regeneration:  As a result of necrosis of hepatocytes,\\nthere is lobular disarray. Surviving adjacent hepatocytes\\nundergo regeneration and hyperplasia. If the necrosiscauses collapse of reticulin framework of the lobule,healing by fibrosis follows, distorting the lobulararchitecture.\\nThe above histologic changes apply to viral hepatitis by\\nvarious types of hepatotropic viruses in general, and by HBVin particular. It is usually not possible to distinguishhistologically between viral hepatitis of various etiologies,but the following morphologic features may help in givingan etiologic clue:\\nHAV hepatitis  is a panlobular involvement by heavy\\ninflammatory infiltrate compared to other types.\\nHCV hepatitis  causes milder necrosis, with fatty change\\nin hepatocytes, presence of lymphoid aggregates in the portaltriads and degeneration of bile duct epithelium.\\nIV. Chronic Hepatitis\\nChronic hepatitis is defined as continuing or relapsing\\nhepatic disease for more than 6 months with symptoms alongwith biochemical, serologic and histopathologic evidence ofinflammation and necrosis. Majority of cases of chronichepatitis are the result of infection with hepatotropicviruses—hepatitis B, hepatitis C and combined hepatitis Band hepatitis D infection. However, some non-viral causesof chronic hepatitis include: Wilson’s disease, α -1-antitrypsin\\ndeficiency, chronic alcoholism, drug-induced injury andautoimmune diseases. The last named gives rise toautoimmune or lupoid hepatitis  which is characterised by\\npositive serum autoantibodies (e.g. antinuclear, anti-smoothmuscle and anti-mitochondrial) and a positive LE cell testbut negative for serologic markers of viral hepatitis.\\nUntil recent years, prediction of prognosis of chronic\\nhepatitis used to be made on the basis of morphology whichdivided it into 2 main types— chronic persistent and chronic\\nactive (aggressive) hepatitis . A third form, chronic lobular\\nhepatitis  is distinguished separately by some as mild form of\\nlobular inflammation without inflammation of portal tractsbut these cases often recover completely. However,subsequent studies have revealed that morphologic subtypesdo not necessarily correlate with prognosis since the diseaseis not essentially static but may vary from mild form to severeand vice versa . Besides, two other factors which determine\\nthe vulnerability of a patient of viral hepatitis to developchronic hepatitis are: impaired immunity  and extremes of age\\nat which the infection is first contracted. Currently, therefore,chronic hepatitis is classified on the basis of etiology andhepatitis activity score (described below). The frequency andseverity with which hepatotropic viruses cause chronichepatitis varies with the organisms as under:\\nHCV  infection accounts for 40-60% cases of chronicity in\\nadults. HCV infection is particularly associated withprogressive form of chronic hepatitis  that may evolve intocirrhosis.\\nHBV  causes chronic hepatitis in 90% of infected infants\\nand in about 5% adult cases of hepatitis B.\\nHDV superinfection on HBV carrier state may be\\nresponsible for chronic hepatitis in 10-40% cases.\\nHAV and HEV do not produce chronic hepatitis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The pathologic features\\nare common to both HBV and HCV infection and includethe following lesions (Fig. 21.13) .\\n1. Piecemeal necrosis . Piecemeal necrosis is defined as\\nperiportal destruction of hepatocytes at the limiting plate(piecemeal = piece by piece). Its features in chronic hepatitis\\nare as under:i\\n) Necrosed hepatocytes at the limiting plate in\\nperiportal zone.ii) Interface hepatitis due to expanded portal tract byinfiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells andmacrophages.iii)Expanded portal tracts are often associated with\\nproliferating bile ductules as a response to liver cell injury.\\n2. Portal tract lesions.  All forms of chronic hepatitis are\\ncharacterised by variable degree of changes in the portal\\ntract.i) Inflammatory cell infiltration by lymphocytes, plasmacells and macrophages (triaditis).ii) Proliferated bile ductules in the expanded portal tracts.iii) Additionally, chronic hepatitis C may show lymphoidaggregates or follicles with reactive germinal centre and612SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\ninfiltration of inflammatory cells in the damaged bile duct\\nepithelial cells.\\n3. Intralobular lesions.  Generally, the architecture of\\nlobule is retained in mild to moderate chronic hepatitis.\\ni) There are focal areas of necrosis and inflammation\\nwithin the hepatic parenchyma.\\nii) Scattered acidophilic bodies in the lobule.iii) Kupffer cell hyperplasia.\\niv) More severe form of injury shows bridging necrosis\\n(i.e. bands of necrosed hepatocytes that may bridge portal\\ntract-to-central vein, central vein-to-central vein, and\\nportal tract-to-portal tract).\\nv) Regenerative changes in hepatocytes in cases of\\npersistent hepatocellular necrosis.\\nvi) Cases of chronic hepatitis C show moderate fatty\\nchange.\\nvii) Cases of chronic hepatitis B show scattered ground-\\nglass hepatocytes indicative of abundance of HBsAg inthe cytoplasm.\\n4. Bridging fibrosis.  The onset of fibrosis in chronic\\nhepatitis from the area of interface hepatitis and bridging\\nnecrosis is a feature of irreversible damage.i) At first, there is periportal fibrosis at the sites of inter-face hepatitis giving the portal tract stellate-shapedappearance.\\nii) Progressive cases show bridging fibrosis connecting\\nportal tract-to-portal tract or portal tract-to-central veintraversing the lobule.\\niii)End-stage of chronic hepatitis is characterised by dense\\ncollagenous septa destroying lobular architecture and\\nforming nodules resulting in postnecrotic cirrhosis.\\nAs prognostic indicator of chronic hepatitis, criteria have\\nbeen evolved to classify chronic hepatitis by giving hepatitis\\nactivity score  (ranging from none to minimal/mild to\\nmoderate and severe) described by Knodell and Ishak basedon the following features:\\nA. Necroinflammatory activity:\\nPeriportal necrosis i.e. piecemeal necrosis and/ or bridging\\nnecrosis (ranging from score 0 as ‘no necrosis’ to score 4 as\\n‘multilobular necrosis’).\\nIntralobular necrosis, focal or confluent  (ranging from score\\n0 as ‘none’ to score 4 for ‘>10 foci’ for focal necrosis, and\\nscore 6 as ‘panacinar/multiacinar’ for  confluent necrosis).\\nChronic hepatitis.

Photomicrograph on right (C) shows stellate-shapedportal triad, with extension of fibrous spurs into lobules. The portal tractis expanded due to increased lymphomononuclear inflammatory cellswhich are seen to breach the limiting plate (i.e. hepatocytes at the interface\\nof portal tract and lobule are destroyed).Figure 21.13613CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine PancreasExtent and depth of portal inflammation (ranging from grade\\n0 as ‘no inflammation’ to grade 4 having ‘marked portal\\ninflammation’).\\nB. Stage of fibrosis:\\nExtent and density of fibrosis  (ranging from score 0 as ‘no\\nfibrosis’ to score 6 as ‘cirrhosis’).\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical features of chronic\\nhepatitis are quite variable ranging from mild disease to full-\\nblown picture of cirrhosis.\\ni) Mild chronic hepatitis shows only slight but persistent\\nelevation of transaminases (‘transaminitis’) with fatigue,malaise and loss of appetite.\\nii)\\nOther cases may show mild hepatomegaly, hepatic\\ntenderness and mild splenomegaly.\\niii) Laboratory findings may reveal prolonged prothrombin\\ntime, hyperbilirubinaemia, hyperglobulinaemia andmarkedly elevated alkaline phosphatase.\\niv) Systemic features of circulating immune complexes due\\nto HBV and HCV infection may produce features of immunecomplex vasculitis, glomerulonephritis and cryoglobuli-naemia in a proportion of cases.\\nHowever, clinical features do not correlate with morpho-\\nlogic appearance of the liver biopsy. Some patients may havemild form of disease without progressing for several yearswhile others may show rapid evolution into cirrhosis withits complications over a period of few years. Patients of long-standing HBV and HCV chronic infection are known toevolve into hepatocellular carcinoma.\\nV. Fulminant Hepatitis\\n(Submassive to Massive Necrosis)\\nFulminant hepatitis is the most severe form of acute hepatitis\\nin which there is rapidly progressive hepatocellular failure.Two patterns are recognised— submassive necrosis  having a\\nless rapid course extending up to 3 months; and massivenecrosis  in which the liver failure is rapid and fulminant\\noccurring in 2-3 weeks.\\nFulminant hepatitis of either of the two varieties can occur\\nfrom viral and non-viral etiologies:\\nAcute viral hepatitis  accounts for about half the cases, most\\noften from HBV and HCV; less frequently from combinedHBV-HDV and rarely from HAV. However, HEV infectionis a serious complication in pregnant women. In addition,herpesvirus can also cause serious viral hepatitis.\\nNon-viral causes  include acute hepatitis due to drug\\ntoxicity (e.g. acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, isoniazid, halothane and anti-depressants), poisonings, hypoxic injury and massiveinfiltration of malignant tumours into the liver.\\nThe patients present with features of hepatic failure with\\nhepatic encephalopathy (page 602). The mortality rate is highif hepatic transplantation is not undertaken.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the liver is small\\nand shrunken, often weighing 500-700 gm. The capsuleis loose and wrinkled. The sectioned surface shows diffuseor random involvement of hepatic lobes. There areextensive areas of muddy-red and yellow necrosis(previously called acute  yellow atrophy)  and patches of\\ngreen bile staining.Histologically,  two forms of fulminant necrosis are\\ndistinguished—submassive and massive necrosis(Fig. 21.14) .\\ni)In submassive necrosis,  large groups of hepatocytes\\nin zone 3 (centrilobular area) and zone 2 (mid zone) arewiped out leading to a collapsed reticulin framework.Regeneration in submassive necrosis is more orderly andmay result in restoration of normal architecture.ii) I n\\n massive necrosis,  the entire liver lobules are\\nnecrotic. As a result of loss of hepatic parenchyma, all thatis left is the collapsed and condensed reticulin frameworkand portal tracts with proliferated bile ductules plugged\\nFigure 21.14 Fulminant hepatitis. There is wiping out of liver lobules with only collapsed reticulin framework left out in their place, high lighted\\nby reticulin stain (right photomicrograph). There is no significant inflammation or fibrosis.\\n614SECTION III Systemic Pathologywith bile. Inflammatory infiltrate is scanty. Regeneration,\\nif it takes place, is disorderly forming irregular masses ofhepatocytes. Fibrosis is generally not a feature offulminant hepatitis.\\nThe clinicopathologic course in two major forms of\\nhepatitis, HBV and HCV, is summarised in  Fig. 21.15 .\\nIMMUNOPROPHYLAXIS AND HEPATITIS VACCINES\\nBest prophylaxis against the viral hepatitis remains\\nprevention of its spread to the contacts after detection and\\nidentification of route by which infection is acquired such as\\nfrom food or water contamination, sexual spread orparenteral spread. Of late, however, immunoprophylaxis anda few hepatitis vaccines have been developed and some moreare under development. The principle underlying either ofthese two forms of prophylaxis is that the persons whodevelop good antibody response to the antigen of thehepatotropic virus following active infection are protectedagainst the disease on reinfection. Thus, pre-testing ofpersons may be carried out so as to determine their antibodylevel. Immunoprophylaxis and hepatitis vaccination areunnecessary if the pre-testing for antibodies is positive.\\n1. Hepatitis A.  Passive immunisation with immune\\nglobulin as well as active immunisation with a killed vaccine\\nare available.\\n2. Hepatitis B.  Earlier, only passive immunoprophylaxis\\nwith standard immune globulin was used. Later, active\\nimmunisation against HBsAg was introduced. Currentrecommendations include pre-exposure and post-exposureprophylaxis with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine:\\nPre-exposure prophylaxis  is done for individuals at high-\\nrisk e.g. health care workers, haemodialysis patients andstaff, haemophiliacs, intravenous drug users etc. Threeintramuscular injections of hepatitis vaccine at 0, 1 and 6months are recommended.\\nPost-exposure prophylaxis  is carried out for unvaccinated\\npersons exposed to HBV infection and includes prophylaxiswith combination of hepatitis B immune globulin andhepatitis B vaccine.3. Hepatitis D.  Hepatitis D infection can also be prevented\\nby hepatitis B vaccine.\\n4. Hepatitis C.  Currently, hepatitis C vaccine has yet not\\nbeen feasible though antibodies to HCV envelope have been\\ndeveloped.\\n5. Hepatitis E.  It is not certain whether immune globulin\\n(like for HAV) prevents hepatitis E infection or not but a\\nvaccine against HEV is yet to be developed.\\nOTHER INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS\\nApart from viral hepatitis, the liver is affected by infections\\nwith bacteria, spirochaetes and fungi and is involved in someparasitic infestations. Some common examples of suchconditions are described below.\\nCHOLANGITIS\\nCholangitis is the term used to describe inflammation of the\\nextrahepatic or intrahepatic bile ducts, or both. There are twomain types of cholangitis—pyogenic and primary sclerosing.While primary sclerosing cholangitis is discussed later withbiliary cirrhosis (page 625), pyogenic cholangitis is describedbelow.\\nPyogenic Cholangitis\\nCholangitis occurring secondary to obstruction of a major\\nextrahepatic duct causes pyogenic cholangitis. Mostcommonly, the obstruction is from impacted gallstone; othercauses are carcinoma arising in the extrahepatic ducts,carcinoma head of pancreas, acute pancreatitis andinflammatory strictures in the bile duct. Bacteria gain entryto the obstructed duct and proliferate in the bile. Infectionspreads along the branches of obstructed duct and reachesthe liver, termed ascending cholangitis.  The common infecting\\nbacteria are enteric organisms such as E.coli,  Klebsiella  and\\nEnterobacter.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The affected ducts show\\nsmall beaded abscesses accompanied by bile stasis alongtheir course and larger abscesses within the liver. Theabscesses are composed of acute inflammatory cells whichin time are replaced by chronic inflammatory cells andenclosed by fibrous capsule.\\nPYOGENIC LIVER ABSCESS\\nMost liver abscesses are of bacterial (pyogenic) origin; less\\noften they are amoebic, hydatid and rarely actinomycotic.Pyogenic liver abscesses have become uncommon due toimproved diagnostic facilities and the early use of antibiotics.However, their incidence is higher in old age and inimmunosuppressed patients such as in AIDS, transplantrecipients and those on intensive chemotherapy.\\nPyogenic liver abscesses are classified on the basis of the\\nmode of entry as under:1.Ascending cholangitis  through ascending infection in the\\nbiliary tract due to obstruction e.g. gallstones, cancer,sclerosing cholangitis and biliary strictures.Figure 21.15 Clinicopathologic course of HBV and HCV infection.\\n615CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas2.Portal pyaemia  by means of spread of pelvic or gastro-\\nintestinal infection resulting in portal pylephlebitis or septic\\nemboli e.g. from appendicitis, empyema of gallbladder,diverticulitis, regional enteritis, pancreatitis, infectedhaemorrhoids and neonatal umbilical vein sepsis.3.Septicaemia  through spread by hepatic artery.\\n4.Direct infection  resulting in solitary liver abscess e.g. from\\nadjacent perinephric abscess, secondary infection in amoebicliver abscess, metastasis and formation of haematomafollowing trauma.5.Iatrogenic causes  include liver biopsy, percutaneous biliary\\ndrainage and accidental surgical trauma.6.Cryptogenic  from unknown causes, especially in the\\nelderly.\\nThe commonest infecting organisms are gram-negative\\nbacteria chiefly E. coli;  others are Pseudomonas, Klebsiella,\\nEnterobacter  and a number of anaerobic organisms,\\nbacteroides and actinomyces.\\nLiver abscesses are clinically characterised by pain in the\\nright upper quadrant, fever, tender hepatomegaly andsometimes jaundice. Laboratory examination revealsleucocytosis, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase,hypoalbuminaemia and a positive blood culture.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly  depending upon\\nthe cause for pyogenic liver abscess, they occur as singleor multiple yellow abscesses, 1 cm or more in diameter,in an enlarged liver. A single abscess generally has a thickfibrous capsule. The abscesses are particularly commonin right lobe of the liver  (Fig. 21.16) .\\nMicroscopically,  typical features of abscess are seen.\\nThere are multiple small neutrophilic abscesses with areasof extensive necrosis of the affected liver parenchyma. Theadjacent viable area shows pus and blood clots in theportal vein, inflammation, congestion and proliferatingfibroblasts. Direct extension from the liver may lead tosubphrenic or pleuro-pulmonary suppuration orperitonitis. There may be small pyaemic abscesseselsewhere such as in the lungs, kidneys, brain and spleen.\\nAMOEBIC LIVER ABSCESS\\nAmoebic liver abscesses are less common than pyogenic liver\\nabscesses and have many similar features. They are causedby the spread of Entamoeba histolytica  from intestinal lesions.\\nThe trophozoite form of amoebae in the colon invade thecolonic mucosa forming flask-shaped ulcers from where theyare carried to the liver in the portal venous system (page188) . Amoebae multiply and block small intrahepatic portalradicles resulting in infarction necrosis of the adjacent liverparenchyma.\\nThe patients, generally from tropical and subtropical\\ncountries, may give history of amoebic dysentery in the past.Cysts of E. histolytica  in stools are present in only 15% of\\npatients of hepatic amoebiasis. Intermittent low-grade fever,pain and tenderness in the liver area are common presentingfeatures. A positive haemagglutination test is quite sensitiveand useful for diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  amoebic liver\\nabscesses are usually solitary and more often located inthe right lobe in the posterosuperior portion. Amoebicliver abscess may vary greatly in size but is generally ofthe size of an orange. The centre of the abscess containslarge necrotic area having reddish-brown, thick pusresembling anchovy or chocolate sauce. The abscess wallconsists of irregular shreds of necrotic liver tissue (Fig.\\n21.17) .\\nHistologically,  the necrotic area consists of degenerated\\nliver cells, leucocytes, red blood cells, strands ofconnective tissue and debris. Amoebae are most easilyfound in the liver tissue at the margin of abscess. PAS-staining is employed to confirm the trophozoites of E.\\nhistolytica.\\nHEPATIC TUBERCULOSIS\\nTuberculosis of the liver occurs as a result of miliary\\ndissemination from primary complex or from chronic adultpulmonary tuberculosis. The diagnosis is possible by liverbiopsy. The patients may have unexplained fever, jaundice,hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly. There may beelevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels andhyperglobulinaemia.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The basic lesion is the\\nepithelioid cell granuloma characterised by central\\nFigure 21.16 Gross appearance of pyogenic abscesses in the liver.\\nFigure 21.17 Amoebic liver abscess is commonly solitary and its\\nwall is irregular and necrotic.\\n616SECTION III Systemic Pathologycaseation necrosis with destruction of the reticulin\\nframework and peripheral cuff of lymphocytes(Fig. 21.18) . Ziehl-Neelsen staining for AFB or culture of\\nthe organism from the biopsy tissue is confirmatory. Rarelesions consist of tuberculous cholangitis and tuberculouspylephlebitis.HYDATID DISEASE (ECHINOCOCCOSIS)\\nHydatid disease occurs as a result of infection by the larval\\ncyst stage of the tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus.  The dog\\nis the common definite host, while man, sheep and cattleare the intermediate hosts. The dog is infected by eating theviscera of sheep containing hydatid cysts. The infected faecesof the dog contaminate grass and farmland from where theova are ingested by sheep, pigs and man. Thus, man canacquire infection by handling dogs as well as by eating conta-minated vegetables. The ova ingested by man are liberatedfrom the chitinous wall by gastric juice and pass throughthe intestinal mucosa from where they are carried to the liverby portal venous system. These are trapped in the hepaticsinusoids where they eventually develop into hydatid cyst.About 70% of hydatid cysts develop in the liver which actsas the first filter for ova. However, ova which pass throughthe liver enter the right side of the heart and are caught inthe pulmonary capillary bed and form pulmonary hydatidcysts. Some ova which enter the systemic circulation giverise to hydatid cysts in the brain, spleen, bone and muscles.\\nThe disease is common in sheep-raising countries such\\nas Australia, New Zealand and South America. Theuncomplicated hydatid cyst of the liver may be silent or may\\nproduce dull ache in the liver area and some abdominaldistension.\\nComplications  of hydatid cyst include its rupture (e.g. into\\nthe peritoneal cavity, bile ducts and lungs), secondaryinfection and hydatid allergy due to sensitisation of the hostwith cyst fluid. The diagnosis is made by peripheral bloodeosinophilia, radiologic examination and serologic tests suchas indirect haemagglutination test and Casoni skin test.\\nFigure 21.18 Miliary tuberculosis liver. The hepatic parenchyma\\nshows epithelioid granulomas with small areas of central necrosis and\\nsurrounded peripherally by Langhans’ giant cells and lymphocytes.\\nFigure 21.19 Hydatid cyst in the liver. The cyst wall is composed of\\nwhitish membrane resembling the membrane of a hard boiled egg.617CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine PancreasMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Hydatid cyst grows\\nslowly and may eventually attain a size over 10 cm in\\ndiameter in about 5 years. E. granulosus  generally causes\\nunilocular hydatid cyst while E. multilocularis  results in\\nmultilocular or alveolar hydatid disease in the liver.\\nThe cyst wall is composed of 3 distinguishable zones—\\nouter pericyst,  intermediate characteristic ectocyst  and inner\\nendocyst  (Fig. 21.19) :\\n1. Pericyst  is the outer host inflammatory reaction\\nconsisting of fibroblastic proliferation, mononuclear cells,eosinophils and giant cells, eventually developing intodense fibrous capsule which may even calcify.\\n2.\\nEctocyst  is the intermediate layer composed of\\ncharacteristic acellular, chitinous, laminated hyaline\\nmaterial  (Fig. 21.20) .\\n3. Endocyst  is the inner germinal layer bearing daughter\\ncysts (brood-capsules) and scolices projecting into thelumen.\\nHydatid sand  is the grain-like material composed of\\nnumerous scolices present in the hydatid fluid. Hydatidfluid, in addition, contains antigenic proteins so that itsliberation into circulation gives rise to pronouncedeosinophilia or may cause anaphylaxis.\\nCHEMICAL  \\nAND DRUG INJURY\\nHEPATIC DRUG METABOLISM.  The liver plays a central\\nrole in the metabolism of a large number of organic andinorganic chemicals and drugs which gain access to the bodyby inhalation, injection, or most commonly, via the intestinaltract. The main drug metabolising system resides in themicrosomal fraction of the smooth endoplasmic reticulumof the liver cells via P-450 cytochrome and cytochromereductase enzyme systems. Other steps involved in the drugmetabolism are its conjugation with an endogenous mole-cule, its active transport from the hepatocytes and ultimatelyits excretion in the bile or in urine depending upon themolecular weight of the substance. A number of risk factorspredispose an individual to hepatic drug injury such as pre-existing liver disease, aging, female sex and genetic inabilityto perform a particular biotransformation.\\nHEPATOTOXICITY.  Toxic liver injury produced by drugs\\nand chemicals may virtually mimic any form of naturally-\\noccurring liver disease. In fact, any patient presenting withliver disease or unexplained jaundice is thoroughlyquestioned about history of drug intake or exposure tochemicals. Hepatotoxicity from drugs and chemicals is thecommonest form of iatrogenic disease. Severity ofhepatotoxicity is greatly increased if the drug is continuedafter symptoms develop.\\nAmong the various inorganic compounds producing\\nhepatotoxicity are arsenic, phosphorus, copper and iron.Organic agents include certain naturally-occurring plant\\ntoxins such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids, mycotoxins andbacterial toxins. The synthetic group of organic compoundsare a large number of medicinal agents. In addition, exposureto hepatotoxic compounds may be occupational,environmental or domestic that could be accidental,homicidal or suicidal ingestion.\\nIn general, drug reactions affecting the liver are divided\\ninto two main classes:\\n1. Direct or predictable,  when the drug or one of its\\nmetabolites is either directly toxic to the liver or it lowers\\nthe host immune defense mechanism. The adverse effectsoccur in most individuals who consume them and theirhepatotoxicity is dose-dependent e.g. carbon tetrachloride.\\n2. Indirect or unpredictable or idiosyncratic, when the\\ndrug or one of its metabolites acts as a hapten and induces\\nhypersensitivity in the host. In many instances, drughepatotoxicity is associated with appearance ofautoantibodies to liver-kidney microsomes (i.e. anti-LKM2)directed against cytochrome P450 enzyme. The hepato-toxicity by this group does not occur regularly in allindividuals and the effects are usually not dose-related e.g.acetaminophen.Figure 21.20 Microscopy shows three layers in the wall of hydatid cyst. Inbox in the right photomicrograph shows a scolex with a row of\\nhooklets.\\n618SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nA simplified clinicopathologic classification of important\\nhepatic drug reactions and the agents causing them is\\npresented in Table 21.7.  The changes produced by\\nhepatotoxic agents may vary from mild, which are diagnosedonly by elevated serum transaminases, to instances ofmassive necrosis and death. The pathologic changes byhepatotoxins include 2 large categories:1.Acute liver disease  characterised by cholestasis,\\nhepatocellular necrosis, fatty change, granulomatous reactionor vascular disease.2.Chronic liver disease  characterised by variable degree of\\nfibrosis, cirrhosis or neoplasia.\\nAs such, the pathologic changes induced by hepatotoxins\\nare indistinguishable from the respective disease states.\\nCIRRHOSIS\\nCirrhosis of the liver is one of the ten leading causes of death\\nin the Western world. It represents the irreversible end-stageof several diffuse diseases causing hepatocellular injury andis characterised by the following 4 features:\\n1.It involves the entire liver.\\n2.The normal lobular architecture of hepatic parenchyma\\nis disorganised.\\n3\\n. There is formation of nodules separated from one another\\nby irregular bands of fibrosis.\\n4. It occurs following hepatocellular necrosis of varying\\netiology so that there are alternate areas of necrosis andregenerative nodules. However, regenerative nodules are notessential for diagnosis of cirrhosis since biliary cirrhosis andcirrhosis in haemochromatosis have little regeneration.\\nPATHOGENESIS\\nIrrespective of the etiology, cirrhosis in general is initiated\\nby hepatocellular necrosis. Continued destruction ofhepatocytes causes collapse of normal lobular hepaticparenchyma followed by fibrosis  around necrotic liver cells\\nand proliferated ductules and there is formation ofcompensatory regenerative nodules.\\nFIBROGENESIS.  Fibrosis in the liver lobules may be portal-\\ncentral, portal-portal, or both. The mechanism of fibrosis isby increased synthesis of all types of collagen and increasein the number of collagen-producing cells. In cirrhosis, thereis proliferation of fat-storing Ito cells underlying thesinusoidal epithelium which become transformed intomyofibroblasts and fibrocytes. Besides collagen, twoglycoproteins, fibronectin and laminin, are deposited inexcessive amounts in area of liver cell damage. The natureof factors acting as stimulants for fibrosis is not clearlyknown, but possible candidate mediators are lymphokinesand monokines.\\nREGENERATIVE NODULE.  The cause of compensatory\\nproliferation of hepatocytes to form regenerative nodules is\\nobscure. Possibly, growth factors, chalones and hormonalimbalance, play a role in regeneration.\\nCLASSIFICATION\\nCirrhosis can be classified on the basis of morphology and\\netiology (Table 21.8).\\nA.MORPHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION.  There are 3\\nmorphologic types of cirrhosis—micronodular, macro-nodular and mixed. Each of these forms may have an activeand inactive form.\\nAn active form  is characterised by continuing hepato-\\ncellular necrosis and inflammatory reaction, a process thatclosely resembles chronic hepatitis.\\nAn inactive form,  on the other hand, has no evidence of\\ncontinuing hepatocellular necrosis and has sharply-definednodules of surviving hepatic parenchyma without anysignificant inflammation.\\n1. Micronodular cirrhosis.  In micronodular cirrhosis, the\\nnodules are usually regular and small, less than 3 mm  in\\ndiameter. There is diffuse involvement of all the hepatic\\nlobules forming nodules by thick fibrous septa which may\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.7: Classification of Hepatic Drug Reactions.\\nPathologic Changes Agents\\nA.

The micronodular\\ncirrhosis includes etiologic type of alcoholic cirrhosis (ornutritional cirrhosis or Laennec’s cirrhosis) and representsimpaired capacity for regrowth as seen in alcoholism,malnutrition, severe anaemia and old age.\\n2. Macronodular cirrhosis.  In this type, the nodules are of\\nvariable size and are generally larger than  3 mm in diameter.\\nThe pattern of involvement is more irregular than in\\nmicronodular cirrhosis, sparing some portal tracts andcentral veins, and more marked evidence of regeneration.Macronodular cirrhosis corresponds to post-necrotic (or post-hepatitis) cirrhosis of the etiologic classification.\\n3. Mixed cirrhosis.  In mixed type, some parts of the liver\\nshow micronodular appearance while other parts show\\nmacronodular pattern. All the portal tracts and central veinsare not involved by fibrosis but instead some of them arespared. Mixed pattern is a kind of incomplete expression ofmicronodular cirrhosis.B. ETIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION.  Based on the etiologic\\nagent for cirrhosis, various categories of cirrhosis aredescribed as given in Table 21.8.\\nSPECIFIC TYPES OF CIRRHOSIS\\nAlcoholic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis\\nAlcoholic liver disease is the term used to describe the\\nspectrum of liver injury associated with acute and chronicalcoholism. There are three sequential stages in alcoholic liverdisease: alcoholic steatosis (fatty liver), alcoholic hepatitis and\\nalcoholic cirrhosis.\\nBefore discussing the features of alcoholic liver disease\\nand cirrhosis, a brief outline of ethanol metabolism isoutlined below and is discussed earlier in Chapter 9 (page239).\\nETHANOL METABOLISM.  One gram of alcohol gives 7\\ncalories. But alcohol cannot be stored in the body and must\\nundergo obligatory oxidation, chiefly in the liver. Thus, theseempty calories make no contribution to nutrition other thanto give energy.\\nEthanol after ingestion and absorption from the small\\nbowel circulates through the liver where about 90% of it isoxidised to acetate by a two-step enzymatic process  involving\\ntwo enzymes: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)  present in the\\ncytosol, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)  in the\\nmitochondria of hepatocytes (Fig. 21.21) . The remaining 10%\\nof ethanol is oxidised elsewhere in the body.\\nFirst step:  Ethanol is catabolised to acetaldehyde in the liver\\nby the following three pathways, one major and two minor:\\ni)In the cytosol,  by the major rate-limiting pathway of\\nalcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).ii)In the smooth endoplasmic reticulum,  via microsomal P-450\\noxidases (also called microsomal ethanol oxidising system,\\nMEOS), where only part of ethanol is metabolised.\\niii)In the peroxisomes,  minor pathway via catalase such as\\nH\\n2O2.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.8: Classification of Cirrhosis.\\nA.

Simultaneously, the cofactor nicotinamide-\\nadenine dinucleotide (NAD) which is a hydrogen acceptor,is reduced to NADH.\\nSecond step:  The second step occurs in the mitochondria\\nwhere acetaldehyde is converted to acetate with ALDH\\nacting as a co-enzyme. Most of the acetate on leaving theliver is finally oxidised to carbon dioxide and water, orconverted by the citric acid cycle to other compoundsincluding fatty acids. Simultaneously, the same cofactor,NAD, is reduced to NADH resulting in increased NADH:\\nNAD redox ratio  which is the basic biochemical alteration\\noccurring during ethanol metabolism. A close estimate ofNADH:NAD ratio is measured by the ratio of its oxidisedand reduced metabolites in the form of lactate-pyruvate ratio\\nand \\nβ-hydroxy butyrate-acetoacetate ratio.\\nRISK FACTORS FOR ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE.  All\\nthose who indulge in alcohol abuse do not develop liverdamage. The incidence of cirrhosis among alcoholics atautopsy is about 10-15%. Why some individuals arepredisposed to alcoholic cirrhosis is not clearly known, buta few risk factors have been implicated. These are as under:\\n1.Drinking patterns.  Most epidemiologic studies have\\nattributed alcoholic cirrhosis to chronic alcoholism. Available\\nevidence suggests that chronic and excessive consumptionof alcohol invariably leads to fatty liver in >90% of chronicalcoholics, progression to alcoholic hepatitis in 10-20% cases,and eventually to alcoholic cirrhosis in more than 10 years.It is generally agreed that continued daily imbibing of 60-80gm of ethanol in any type of alcoholic beverage for at least10 years is likely to result in alcoholic cirrhosis. Liver injuryis related to the quantity of ethanol contained in alcoholicbeverage consumed and its duration, but not related to thetype of alcoholic beverage consumed. Ethanol content in analcoholic beverage is given on the label of the container, butin general, it s about 4-6% in beer, 10-12% in wine, and about40-50% in brandy, whisky and scotch. Intermittent drinkingfor long duration is less harmful since the liver is givenchance to recover.\\n2. Gender.  Women have increased susceptibility to develop\\nadvanced alcoholic liver disease with much lesser alcohol\\nintake (20-40 g/day). This gender difference in diseaseprogression is unclear but is probably linked to effects ofoestrogen.\\n3\\n. Malnutrition.  Absolute or relative malnutrition of\\nproteins and vitamins is regarded as a contributory factor in\\nthe evolution of cirrhosis. The combination of chronic alcoholingestion and impaired nutrition leads to alcoholic liverdisease and not malnutrition per se.  It appears that calories\\nderived from alcohol displace other nutrients leading tomalnutrition and deficiency of vitamins in alcoholics.Additional factors contributing to malnutrition in alcoholicsare chronic gastritis and pancreatitis. The evidence in favourof synergistic effect of malnutrition in chronic alcoholismcomes from clinical and morphologic improvement in casesof alcoholic cirrhosis on treatment with protein-rich diets.\\n4. Infections.  Intercurrent bacterial infections are common\\nin cirrhotic patients and may accelerate the course of thedisease. Lesions similar to alcoholic cirrhosis may develop\\nin non-alcoholic patients who have had viral infections inthe past.\\n5. Genetic factors.  The rate of ethanol metabolism is under\\ngenetic control. It is chiefly related to altered rates of\\nelimination of ethanol due to genetic polymorphism for thetwo main enzyme systems, MEOS (microsomal P-450oxidases) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Various HLAhistocompatibility types have been associated withsusceptibility of different populations to alcoholic liverdamage but no single genotype has been identified yet.\\n6. Hepatitis C infection.  Concurrent infection with HCV is\\nan important risk factor for progression of alcoholic liver\\ndisease. HCV infection in chronic alcoholic leads todevelopment of alcoholic liver disease with much less alcoholconsumption (20-50 g/day), disease progression at a youngerage, having greater severity, and increased risk to developcirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and overall poorersurvival.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Exact pathogenesis of alcoholic liver\\ninjury is yet unclear as to why only some chronic alcoholics\\ndevelop the complete sequence of changes in the liver whileothers don’t.  However, knowledge and understanding ofthe ethanol metabolism has resulted in discarding the oldconcept of liver injury due to malnutrition. Instead, now itis known that ethanol and its metabolites are responsible forill-effects on the liver in a susceptible chronic alcoholic havingabove-mentioned risk factors.  Briefly, the biomedical andcellular pathogenesis due to chronic alcohol consumptionculminating in morphologic lesions of alcoholic steatosis(fatty liver), alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis canbe explained as under and is schematically illustrated inFig. 21.22 :\\n1.Direct hepatotoxicity by ethanol.  There is evidence to\\nsuggest that ethanol ingestion for a period of 8-10 days regu-larly may cause direct hepatotoxic effect on the liver andproduce fatty change. Ethanol is directly toxic to micro-tubules, mitochondria and membrane of hepatocytes.\\n2.\\nHepatotoxicity by ethanol metabolites.  The major\\nhepatotoxic effects of ethanol are exerted by its metabolites,\\nchiefly acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde levels in blood areelevated in chronic alcoholics. Acetaldehyde produceshepatotoxicity by production of two adducts:i) Production of protein-aldehyde adducts  which are extremely\\ntoxic and can cause cytoskeletal and membrane damage andbring about hepatocellular necrosis.ii) Formation of malon-di-aldehyde-acetaldehyde (MAA) adductswhich produce autoantibodies and initiate autoimmuneresponse. Theses adducts have also a role in hepaticfibrogenesis due to peroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptor (PPAR)- γ on hepatocytes.\\n3. Oxidative stress.  Oxidation of ethanol by the cytochrome-\\n450 oxidases (MEOS) leads to generation of free radicalswhich causes oxidative damage to the membranes andproteins.\\n4. Immunological mechanism.  Cell-mediated immunity is\\nimpaired in alcoholic liver disease. Ethanol causes direct621CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasimmunologic attack on hepatocytes. In a proportion of cases,\\nalcohol-related liver cell injury continues unabated despitecessation of alcohol consumption which is attributed toimmunologic mechanisms. Immunological mechanism mayalso explain the genesis of Mallory’s alcoholic hyalin thoughmore favoured hypothesis for its origin is the aggregation ofintermediate filaments of prekeratin type due to alcohol-induced disorganisation of cytoskeleton.\\n5. Inflammation. Chronic ethanol ingestion is not only\\ninjurious to hepatocytes but also damages the intestinal cells.\\nThe injured intestinal cells elaborate endotoxins whichrelease proinflammatory cytokines, chiefly tumour necrosisfactor- α, IL-1, IL-6 and TGF- β. These cytokines and\\nendotoxinaemia produce apoptosis and necrosis ofhepatocytes and initiate inflammatory reaction in the alcoholdamaged liver.\\n6. Fibrogenesis. Main event facilitating hepatic fibrogenesis\\nis activation of stellate cells by various stimuli:\\ni) by damaged hepatocytes,ii) by malon-di-aldehyde-acetaldehyde  adducts,\\niii) by activated Kupffer cells, andiv) direct stimulation by acetaldehyde.\\nAll forms of collagen are increased and there is increased\\ntransformation of fat-storing lto cells into myofibroblasts andfibrocytes.\\n7. Increased redox ratio.  Marked increase in the NADH:NAD\\nredox ratio in the hepatocytes results in increased redox ratio\\nof lactate-pyruvate, leading to lactic acidosis. This alteredredox potential has been implicated in a number of metabolicconsequences such as in fatty liver, collagen formation,occurrence of gout, impaired gluconeogenesis and altered\\nsteroid metabolism.\\n8. Retention of liver cell water and proteins. Alcohol is\\ninhibitory to secretion of newly-synthesised proteins by the\\nliver leading to their retention in the hepatocytes. Water issimultaneously retained in the cell in proportion to theprotein and results in swelling of hepatocytes resulting in\\nhepatomegaly in alcoholics.\\n9. Hypoxia.  Chronic ingestion of alcohol results in increased\\noxygen demand by the liver resulting in a hypoxic state\\nwhich causes hepatocellular necrosis in centrilobular zone\\n(zone 3). Redox changes are also more marked in zone 3.\\n10. Increased liver fat.  The origin of fat in the body was\\ndiscussed in Chapter 3 (page 37). In chronic alcoholism, there\\nis rise in the amount of fat available to the liver which couldbe from exogenous (dietary) sources, excess mobilisation\\nfrom adipose tissue or increased lipid synthesis by the liveritself. This may account for lipid accumulation in thehepatocytes.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Three types of morpho-\\nlogic lesions are described in alcoholic liver disease—alcoholic steatosis (fatty liver), alcoholic hepatitis andalcoholic cirrhosis.\\n1. ALCOHOLIC  STEATOSIS (FATTY LIVER).  The\\nmorphologic changes in fatty change in liver have already\\nbeen described on page 37 and are briefly considered here.Grossly,  the liver is enlarged, yellow, greasy and firm with\\na smooth and glistening capsule.Microscopically,  the features consist of initial micro-\\nvesicular  droplets of fat in the hepatocyte cytoplasm\\nfollowed by more common and pronounced feature ofmacrovesicular  large droplets of fat displacing the nucleus\\nto the periphery  (Fig. 21.23) . Fat cysts  may develop due to\\ncoalescence and rupture of fat-containing hepatocytes.Less often, lipogranulomas  consisting of collection of\\nlymphocytes, macrophages and some multinucleate giantcells may be found.\\n2. ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS.  Alcoholic hepatitis\\ndevelops acutely, usually following a bout of heavy drin-\\nking. Repeated episodes of alcoholic hepatitis super-imposed on pre-existing fatty liver are almost certainly aforerunner of alcoholic cirrhosis.Histologically,  the features of alcoholic hepatitis are as\\nfollows (Fig. 21.24)\\n:\\ni) Hepatocellular necrosis:  Single or small clusters of\\nhepatocytes, especially in the centrilobular area (zone 3),undergo ballooning degeneration and necrosis.ii) Mallory bodies or alcoholic hyalin:  These are\\neosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions seen inperinuclear location within swollen and balloonedhepatocytes. They represent aggregates of cytoskeletalintermediate filaments (prekeratin). They can be bestvisualised with connective tissue stains like Masson’strichrome and chromophobe aniline blue, or by the useof immunoperoxidase methods. Mallory bodies are highlysuggestive of, but not specific for, alcoholic hepatitis sinceFigure 21.22 Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.\\n622SECTION III Systemic PathologyMallory bodies are also found in certain other conditions\\nsuch as: primary biliary cirrhosis, Indian childhoodcirrhosis, cholestatic syndromes, Wilson’s disease,intestinal bypass surgery, focal nodular hyperplasia andhepatocellular carcinoma.iii)Inflammatory response:  The areas of hepatocellular\\nnecrosis and regions of Mallory bodies are associated withan inflammatory infiltrate, chiefly consisting ofpolymorphs and some scattered mononuclear cells. Inmore extensive necrosis, the inflammatory infiltrate ismore widespread and may involve the entire lobule.iv) Fibrosis:  Most cases of alcoholic hepatitis are\\naccompanied by pericellular and perivenular fibrosis,producing a web-like or chickenwire-like appearance. Thisis also termed as creeping collagenosis.3. ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS.  Alcoholic cirrhosis is the\\nmost common form of lesion, constituting 60-70% of allcases of cirrhosis. Several terms have been used for thistype of cirrhosis such as Laennec’s cirrhosis, portal cirrhosis,\\nhobnail cirrhosis, nutritional cirrhosis, diffuse cirrhosis  and\\nmicronodular cirrhosis.\\nGrossly,  alcoholic cirrhosis classically begins as\\nmicronodular cirrhosis (nodules less than 3 mm diameter),\\nthe liver being large, fatty and weighing usually above2 kg (Fig. 21.25) . Eventually over a span of years, the liver\\nshrinks to less than 1 kg in weight, becomes non-fatty,having macronodular cirrhosis (nodules larger than 3 mmin diameter), resembling post-necrotic cirrhosis. Thenodules of the liver due to their fat content are tawny-yellow, on the basis of which Laennec in 1818 introducedFigure 21.23 Fatty liver (alcoholic steatosis). Most of the hepatocytes are distended with large lipid vacuoles with peripherally displaced nuclei.\\nFigure 21.24 Alcoholic hepatitis. Liver cells show ballooning degeneration and necrosis with some containing Mallory’s hyalin (Inbox). Fatty\\nchange and clusters of neutrophils are also present.\\n623CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasthe term cirrhosis  first of all (from Greek kirrhos  = tawny).\\nThe surface of liver in alcoholic cirrhosis is studded with\\ndiffuse nodules which vary little in size, producinghobnail liver (because of the resemblance of the surfacewith the sole of an old-fashioned shoe having short nailswith heavy heads). On cut section, spheroidal or angularnodules of fibrous septa are seen.\\nMicroscopically,  alcoholic cirrhosis is a progressive\\nalcoholic liver disease. Its features include the following\\n(Fig. 21.26) :i) Nodular pattern:  Normal lobular architecture is\\neffaced in which central veins are hard to find and isreplaced with nodule formation.ii) Fibrous septa:  The fibrous septa that divide the hepatic\\nparenchyma into nodules are initially delicate and extendfrom central vein to portal regions, or portal tract to portaltract, or both. As the fibrous scarring increases with time,the fibrous septa become dense and more confluent.iii)Hepatic parenchyma:  The hepatocytes in the islands\\nof surviving parenchyma undergo slow proliferation\\nFigure 21.26 Alcoholic cirrhosis, microscopic appearance. It shows nearly uniform-sized micronodules, devoid of central veins and having\\nthick fibrous septa dividing them. There is minimal inflammation and some reactive bile duct proliferation in the septa.\\nFigure 21.25 Alcoholic cirrhosis, showing the typical micronodular\\npattern in gross specimen.

Externally\\nthe liver is small, distorted and irregularly scarred.forming regenerative nodules having disorganised masses\\nof hepatocytes. The hepatic parenchyma within thenodules shows extensive fatty change early in the disease.But as the fibrous septa become more thick, the amountof fat in hepatocytes is reduced. Thus, there is an inverserelationship between the amount of fat and the amountof fibrous scarring in the nodules.iv) Necrosis, inflammation and bile duct proliferation:The etiologic clue to diagnosis in the form of Mallorybodies is hard to find in a fully-developed alcoholiccirrhosis. The fibrous septa usually contain sparseinfiltrate of mononuclear cells with some bile ductproliferation. Bile stasis and increased cytoplasmichaemosiderin deposits due to enhanced iron absorptionin alcoholic cirrhosis are some other noticeable findings.\\nLABORATORY DIAGNOSIS.  The clinical manifestations\\nand complications of cirrhosis in general are described onpage 630. The laboratory findings in the course of alcoholicliver disease may be quite variable and liver biopsy isnecessary in doubtful cases. Progressive form of the disease,however, generally presents the following biochemical andhaematological alterations:1.Elevated transaminases: increase in SGOT (AST) is more\\nthan that of SGPT (ALT).2. Rise in serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase ( γ-GT).\\n3. Elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase.4. Hyperbilirubinaemia.5. Hypoproteinaemia with reversal of albumin-globulinratio.6. Prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastintime.7. Anaemia.8. Neutrophilic leucocytosis in alcoholic hepatitis and insecondary infections.Post-necrotic Cirrhosis\\nPost-necrotic cirrhosis, also termed post-hepatitic cirrhosis,\\nmacronodular cirrhosis  and coarsely nodular cirrhosis,  is\\ncharacterised by large and irregular nodules with broad\\nbands of connective tissue and occurring most commonlyafter previous viral hepatitis.\\nETIOLOGY.  Based on epidemiologic and serologic studies,\\nthe following factors have been implicated in the etiology of\\npost-necrotic cirrhosis.\\n1.Viral hepatitis.  About 25% of patients give history of\\nrecent or remote attacks of acute viral hepatitis followed by\\nchronic viral hepatitis. Most common association is withhepatitis B and C; hepatitis A is not known to evolve intocirrhosis. It is estimated that about 20% cases of HBV chronichepatitis and about 20-30% cases of HCV chronic hepatitisgo to develop cirrhosis over 20-30 years.\\n2. Drugs and chemical hepatotoxins.  A small percentage\\nof cases may have origin from toxicity due to chemicals and\\ndrugs such as phosphorus, carbon tetrachloride, mushroompoisoning, acetaminophen and α-methyl dopa.\\n3. Others.  Certain infections (e.g. brucellosis), parasitic\\ninfestations (e.g. clonorchiasis), metabolic diseases (e.g.Wilson’s disease or hepatolenticular degeneration) andadvanced alcoholic liver disease may produce a picture ofpost-necrotic cirrhosis.\\n4. Idiopathic.  After all these causes have been excluded, a\\ngroup of cases remain in which the etiology is unknown.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Typically, post-necrotic\\ncirrhosis is macronodular type.\\nGrossly,  the liver is usually small, weighing less than\\n1 kg, having distorted shape with irregular and coarsescars and nodules of varying size  (Fig. 21.27) . Sectioned\\nFigure 21.27625CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreassurface shows scars and nodules varying in diameter from\\n3 mm to a few centimeters.\\nMicroscopically,  the features are as follows (Fig. 21.28) :\\n1. Nodular pattern:  The normal lobular architecture of\\nhepatic parenchyma is mostly lost and is replaced by\\nnodules larger than those in alcoholic cirrhosis. However,uninvolved portal tracts and central veins in the hepaticlobules can still be seen in some parts of survivingparenchyma.\\n2.Fibrous septa:  The fibrous septa dividing the variable-\\nsized nodules are generally thick.\\n3.\\nNecrosis, inflammation and bile duct proliferation:\\nActive liver cell necrosis is usually inconspicuous. Fibrous\\nsepta contain prominent mononuclear inflammatory cellinfiltrate which may even form follicles, especially in casesfollowing HCV chronic hepatitis. Often there is extensiveproliferation of bile ductules derived from collapsed liverlobules.\\n4. Hepatic parenchyma:  Liver cells vary considerably in\\nsize and multiple large nuclei are common in regenerative\\nnodules. Fatty change may or may not be present in thehepatocytes.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Besides the general clinical features\\ndescribed on page 630, post-necrotic cirrhosis is seen as\\nfrequent in women as in men, especially in the younger age\\ngroup. Like in alcoholic cirrhosis, the patients may remain\\nasymptomatic or may present with prominent signs andsymptoms of chronic hepatitis (page 611). Splenomegaly andhypersplenism are other prominent features. The results of\\nhaematologic and liver function test are similar to those of\\nalcoholic cirrhosis. Out of the various types of cirrhosis, post-necrotic cirrhosis, especially when related to hepatitis B andC virus infection in early life, is more frequently associated\\nwith hepatocellular  carcinoma.Biliary Cirrhosis\\nBiliary cirrhosis is defined as a chronic disorder characterised\\nby clinical, biochemical and morphological features of long-continued cholestasis of intrahepatic or extrahepatic origin.\\nBiliary cirrhosis is of following types:\\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis  in which the destructive process\\nof unknown etiology affects intrahepatic bile ducts.\\nSecondary biliary cirrhosis  resulting from prolonged\\nmechanical obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary passages.\\nPrimary sclerosing  cholangitis and autoimmune\\ncholangiopathy causing biliary cirrhosis.\\nETIOLOGY.  The etiology of these forms of biliary cirrhosis\\nis distinctive:\\nA. Primary biliary cirrhosis.  The etiology of this type\\nremains unknown. However, a few factors have been\\nimplicated:1.The condition is predominant in middle-aged women\\n(male: female ratio = 1:9) and has led to the suggestion of apossible endocrine origin.\\n2.Familial incidence  has been observed suggesting the role\\nof some genetic influence and certain HLA types.3\\n. There is elevated cholesterol  level with appearance of\\nxanthoma and xanthelasma. Hepatomegaly and chronic liverdisease are late features of the disease.4. However, presently the most widely accepted hypothesis\\nis autoimmune origin  of the disease. In support are the\\nfollowing observations:\\nincreased incidence of associated autoimmune diseases\\n(e.g. scleroderma, Sjögren’s syndrome, CREST syndrome,\\nand autoimmune thyroiditis),\\ncirculating anti-mitochondrial antibody of IgG class\\ndetected in more than 90% cases;\\nelevated levels of immunoglobulins, particularly of IgM;\\nincreased levels of circulating immune complexes;\\ndecreased number of circulating T-cells; and\\naccumulation of T cells around bile ducts.Figure 21.28 Post-necrotic cirrhosis. Fibrous septa dividing the hepatic parenchyma into nodules are thick and contain prominent mononuclear\\ninflammatory cell infiltrate and bile ductular hyperplasia. A few intact hepatic lobules remain.\\n626SECTION III Systemic PathologyB. Secondary biliary cirrhosis.  Most cases of secondary\\nbiliary cirrhosis result from prolonged obstruction of\\nextrahepatic biliary passages (page 599). These causesinclude the following:1. Extrahepatic cholelithiasis, most common2. Biliary atresia3. Cancer of biliary tree and of head of pancreas4. Postoperative strictures with superimposed ascendingcholangitis.\\nC. Cirrhosis due to primary sclerosing cholangitis.  Primary\\nor idiopathic sclerosing cholangitis  is a chronic cholestatic\\nsyndrome of unknown etiology. It is characterised by\\nprogressive, inflammatory, sclerosing and obliterativeprocess affecting the entire biliary passages, both extra-hepatic and intrahepatic ducts. Although etiology remainsunknown, various mechanisms have been postulated whichinclude viral and bacterial infections, immunologic injury,toxins, and genetic predisposition.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  in biliary\\ncirrhosis of all types, the liver is initially enlarged andcharacteristically greenish  in appearance, but later becomes\\nsmaller, firmer and coarsely micronodular. In cirrohosisdue to primary sclerosing cholangitis, there is charac-teristic beading of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts dueto irregular strictures and dilatation.Microscopically,  the features of intra- and extrahepatic\\ncholestasis correspond to primary and secondary biliarycirrhosis respectively discussed on page 599. The salientfeatures of various forms of biliary cirrhosis are as under:\\nA. Primary biliary cirrhosis:  The diagnostic histologic\\nfeature is a chronic, non-suppurative, destructive\\ncholangitis involving intrahepatic bile ducts. The diseaseevolves through the following 4 histologic states:\\nStage I:  There are florid bile duct lesions confined to portal\\ntracts. The changes in the affected area consist of\\ndestruction of bile ducts, presence of bile plugs, infiltrationwith acute and chronic inflammatory cells and sometimesformation of granulomas and lymphoid follicles.\\nStage II:  There is ductular proliferation.  The ductal involve-\\nment is quite widespread with very few normal bile ducts.\\nThe inflammatory infiltrate too extends beyond the portaltracts into surrounding hepatic parenchyma. PeriportalMallory bodies may be present.\\nStage III:  This stage is characterised by  fibrous scarring\\ninterconnecting the portal areas. There is diminished\\ninflammatory infiltrate and reduced number of bile ducts.\\nStage IV:  Well-formed micronodular pattern of cirrhosis\\ndevelops in a period of a few years  (Fig. 21.29) .\\nB. Secondary biliary cirrhosis:  Prolonged obstruction of\\nextrahepatic bile ducts may produce the following\\nhistologic changes:1.Bile stasis,  degeneration and focal areas of centrilobular\\nnecrosis of hepatocytes.2.Proliferation, dilatation and rupture of bile ductules\\nin the portal area with formation of bile lakes.\\n3.Cholangitis,  sterile or pyogenic, with accumulation of\\npolymorphs around the bile ducts.4.Progressive expansion  of the portal tract by fibrosis and\\nevolution into micronodular cirrhosis.C. Cirrhosis due to primary sclerosing cholangitis:Following changes are seen:\\n1.Fibrosing cholangitis  with lymphocytic infiltrate around\\nbile ducts with segmental involvement.\\n2.Periductal fibrosis  with eventual obliteration of lumen\\nof affected bile ducts.3.Intervening bile ducts  are dilated, tortuous and\\ninflamed.\\n4.\\nLate cases show cholestasis  and full-blown picture of\\nbiliary cirrhosis.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinical features of the three types\\nof biliary cirrhosis are variable:\\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis  may remain asymptomatic for\\nmonths to years. Symptoms develop insidiously. Basically,\\nit is a cholestatic disorder. The patients present with\\npersistent pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, steatorrhoea,\\njaundice and skin pigmentation. The earliest laboratoryfinding is a markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphataselevel. Elevation of serum lipids is accompanied by\\nappearance of periorbital xanthelasma and xanthomas over\\njoints. Death usually results from hepatic failure, varicealbleeding, intercurrent infections and concomitantdevelopment of cancers of liver and breast.\\nThe diagnosis of  secondary biliary cirrhosis is considered\\nin patients with previous history of gallstones, biliary tractsurgery or clinical features of ascending cholangitis.\\nThe patients of primary sclerosing cholangitis  may\\nremain asymptomatic or may show features of cholestaticjaundice (raised alkaline phosphatase, pruritus, fatigue). Latecases show manifestations of chronic liver disease. The\\ndisease occurs in 3rd to 5th decade of life with two fold\\npreponderance in males.Figure 21.29 Primary biliary cirrhosis, diagrammatic representation.\\nThere are fibrous scars dividing the hepatic parenchyma into the\\nmicronodules. The fibrous septa contain prominent lymphoid infiltrateand proliferated bile ducts. Many of the hepatocytes contain elongatedbile plugs.\\n627CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine PancreasThe contrasting features of three main types of\\nintrahepatic disorders leading to biliary cirrhosis are\\nsummarised in Table 21.9.\\nPigment Cirrhosis in Haemochromatosis\\nHaemochromatosis is an iron-storage disorder in which there\\nis excessive accumulation of iron in parenchymal cells witheventual tissue damage and functional insufficiency oforgans such as the liver, pancreas, heart and pituitary gland.The condition is characterised by a triad of features—micronodular pigment cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus  and skin\\npigmentation.  On the basis of the last two features, the disease\\nhas also come to be termed as ‘bronze diabetes’. Males\\npredominate and manifest earlier since women havephysiologic iron loss delaying the effects of excessiveaccumulation of iron. Haemochromatosis exists in 2 mainforms:1.Idiopathic (primary, genetic) haemochromatosis is an\\nautosomal recessive disorder of excessive accumulation ofiron. It is associated with overexpression of HFE gene locatedon chromosome 6 close to the HLA gene locus, and normallyregulates intestinal absorption of iron. Mutated(overexpressed) HFE gene complexes with transferrinreceptor on intestinal crypt epithelial cells and results inexcessive absoption of dietary iron throughout life.\\n2.Secondary (acquired) haemochromatosis  is gross iron\\noverload with tissue injury arising secondary to other\\ndiseases such as thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemias,alcoholic cirrhosis or multiple transfusions.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  A general discussion of iron\\nmetabolism and iron excess states is given on page 41.\\nNormally, the body iron content is 3-4 gm which is\\nmaintained in such a way that intestinal mucosal absorp-\\ntion of iron is equal to its loss. This amount is approximately1 mg/day in men and 1.5 mg/day in menstruating women.In haemochromatosis, however, this amount goes up to 4mg/day or more, as evidenced by elevated serum iron(normal about 125 μg/dl) and increased serum transferrin\\nsaturation (normal 30%).\\nIn idiopathic or hereditary haemochromatosis,  the\\nprimary mechanism of disease appears to be the genetic basisin which the defect may either lie at the intestinal mucosallevel causing excessive iron absorption, or at the post-absorption excretion level leading to excessive accumulationof iron. The excess iron in primary haemochromatosis isdeposited mainly in the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells oforgans such as the liver, pancreas, spleen, heart andendocrine glands. Tissue injury results from iron-ladenlysosomes of parenchymal cells and lipid peroxidation of cellorganelles by excess iron.\\nIn secondary or acquired haemochromatosis,  there is\\nexcessive accumulation of iron due to acquired causes likeineffective erythropoiesis, defective haemoglobin synthesis,multiple blood transfusions and enhanced absorption of irondue to alcohol consumption. The last-named phenomenonis observed in Bantu siderosis  affecting South African Bantu\\ntribals who consume large quantities of home-brew preparedin iron vessels. Cases of secondary haemochromatosis haveincreased iron storage within the reticuloendothelial systemand liver. However, the magnitude of the iron excess insecondary haemochromatosis is generally insufficient tocause tissue damage.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Excessive deposition of\\niron in organs and tissues is ferritin and haemosiderin,both of which appear as golden-yellow pigment granulesin the cytoplasm of affected parenchymal cells andhaemosiderin stains positively with Prussian bluereaction. The organs most frequently affected are the liverand pancreas, and to a lesser extent, the heart, endocrineglands, skin, synovium and testis.\\nIn the liver,  excess of pigment accumulates in the\\nhepatocytes, and less often Kupffer cells and in bile ductepithelium. The deposits in the initial stage may beprominent in the periportal liver cells along with increasedfibrosis in the portal zone. Eventually, micronodular\\ncirrhosis develops. The deposits may produce grosslychocolate-brown colour of the liver and nodular surface.\\nIn the pancreas,  pigmentation is less intense and is\\nfound in the acinar and islet cells. The deposits in pancreasproduce diffuse interstitial fibrosis and atrophy ofparenchymal cells leading to occurrence of diabetesmellitus.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The major clinical manifestations\\nof haemochromatosis include skin pigmentation, diabetes\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.9: Contrasting Features of Major Forms of Biliary Cirrhosis.\\nFeature Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Secondary Biliary Cirrhosis Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis\\n1.

Characteristic bronze pigmentation is thepresenting feature in about 90% of cases. Demonstration ofexcessive parenchymal iron stores is possible by measure-ment of serum iron, determination of percent saturation oftransferrin, measurement of serum ferritin concentration,estimation of chelatable iron stores using chelating agent (e.g.desferrioxamine), and finally, by liver biopsy. Occurrenceof hepatocellular carcinoma is a late complication ofhaemochromatosis-induced cirrhosis.\\nCirrhosis in Wilson’s Disease\\nWilson’s disease, also termed by a more descriptive desig-\\nnation of hepatolenticular degeneration,  is an autosomal\\nrecessive inherited disease of copper metabolism,characterised by toxic accumulation of copper in manytissues, chiefly the liver, brain and eye. These accumulationslead to the triad  of features:\\n1.Cirrhosis of the liver.\\n2.Bilateral degeneration of the basal ganglia of the brain.\\n3.\\nGreenish-brown pigmented rings in the periphery of the\\ncornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings).\\nThe disease manifests predominantly in children and\\nyoung adults (5-30 years). Initially, the clinical manifestationsare referable to liver involvement such as jaundice andhepatomegaly (hepatic form)  but later progressive\\nneuropsychiatric changes  and Kayser-Fleischer rings  in the\\ncornea appear.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The pathogenesis of Wilson’s disease is\\nbest understood when compared with normal copper\\nmetabolism.\\nNormally,  dietary copper is more than body’s\\nrequirement. Excess copper so absorbed through the stomachand duodenum is transported to the liver where it is\\nincorporated into α\\n2-globulin to form ceruloplasmin, which\\nis excreted by the liver via bile normally. Most of the plasma\\ncopper circulates as ceruloplasmin. Only minute amount ofcopper is excreted in the urine normally.\\nIn Wilson’s disease,  the initial steps of dietary absorp-\\ntion and transport of copper to the liver are normal butcopper accumulates in the liver rather than being excretedby the liver. The underlying defect in chromosome 13 is amutation in ATP7B gene, the normal hepatic copper-excreting gene. Eventually, capacity of hepatocytes to storecopper is exceeded and copper is  released into circulation\\nwhich then gets deposited in extrahepatic tissues such as the\\nbrain, eyes and others. However, increased copper in thekidney does not produce any serious renal dysfunction.\\nBiochemical abnormalities in Wilson’s disease include the\\nfollowing:1Decreased serum ceruloplasmin  (due to impaired synthesis\\nof apoceruloplasmin in damaged liver and defectivemobilisation of copper from hepatocellular lysosomes).2.Increased hepatic copper  in liver biopsy (due to excessive\\naccumulation of copper in the liver).\\n3.Increased urinary excretion  of copper.\\n4. However, serum copper levels  are of no diagnostic help\\nand may vary from low-to-normal-to-high depend- ing uponthe stage of disease.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The  liver  shows varying\\ngrades of changes that include fatty change, acute andchronic active hepatitis, submassive liver necrosis andmacronodular cirrhosis. Mallory bodies are present insome cases. Copper is usually deposited in the periportalhepatocytes in the form of reddish granules in thecytoplasm or as reddish cytoplasmic coloration, stainableby rubeanic acid or rhodamine stains for copper.\\nInvolvement of basal ganglia in the brain  is seen in\\nthe form of toxic injury to neurons, in the cornea  as\\ngreenish-brown deposits of copper in Descemet’smembrane, and in the kidney  as fatty and hydropic\\nchange.\\nCirrhosis in α αα αα-1-Antitryp sin Deficiency\\nAlpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal codominant\\ncondition in which the homozygous state produces liverdisease (cirrhosis), pulmonary disease (emphysema), or both(page 479). α-1-antitrypsin is a glycoprotein normally\\nsynthesised in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of thehepatocytes and is the most potent protease inhibitor (Pi). Asingle autosomal dominant gene coding for α-1-antitrypsin\\nis located on long arm of chromosome 14 that codes forimmunoglobulin light chains too. Out of 24 different alleleslabelled alphabetically, PiMM is the most common normalphenotype, while the most frequent abnormal phenotype inα-1-antitrypsin deficiency leading to liver and/or lung\\ndisease is PiZZ in homozygote form. Other phenotypes in\\nwhich liver disease occurs are PiSS and Pi-null in which\\nserum α-1-antitrypsin value is nearly totally deficient.\\nIntermediate phenotypes, PiMZ and PiSZ persons arepredisposed to develop hepatocellular carcinoma.\\nThe patients may present with respiratory disease due\\nto the development of emphysema, or may develop liverdysfunction, or both. At birth or in neonates, the features ofcholestatic jaundice of varying severity may appear. Inadolescence, the condition may evolve into hepatitis orcirrhosis which is usually well compensated.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Pulmonary changes in α-\\n1-antitrypsin deficiency in the form of emphysema aredescribed in Chapter 17. The hepatic changes varyaccording to the age at which the deficiency becomesapparent. At birth or in neonates, the histologic featuresconsist of neonatal hepatitis that may be acute or ‘pure’cholestasis. Micronodular or macronodular cirrhosis mayappear in childhood or in adolescence in which thediagnostic feature is the presence of intracellular,acidophilic, PAS-positive globules in the periportalhepatocytes. Ultrastructurally, these globules consist ofdilated rough endoplasmic reticulum.\\nCardiac Cirrhosis\\nCardiac cirrhosis is an uncommon complication of severe\\nright-sided congestive heart failure of long-standing duration(page 99). The common causes culminating in cardiaccirrhosis are cor pulmonale, tricuspid insufficiency orconstrictive pericarditis. The pressure in the right ventricle629CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasis elevated which is transmitted to the liver via the inferior\\nvena cava and hepatic veins. The patients generally haveenlarged and tender liver with mild liver dysfunction.Splenomegaly occurs due to simple passive congestion.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the liver is\\nenlarged and firm with stretched Glisson’s capsule.Histologically,  in acute stage, the hepatic sinusoids are\\ndilated and congested with haemorrhagic necrosis ofcentrilobular hepatocytes (central haemorrhagic necrosis).\\nSevere and more prolonged heart failure results in delicatefibrous strands radiating from the central veins. Thesefibrous strands may form interconnections leading tocardiac cirrhosis and regenerative nodules.\\nIndian Childhood Cirrhosis\\nIndian childhood cirrhosis (ICC) is an unusual form of\\ncirrhosis seen in children between the age of 6 months and 3years in rural, middle class, Hindus in India and in parts ofSouth-East Asia and in the Middle-East. There is no role ofviral infection in its etiology. Instead, a combination of somecommon toxic effects and inherited abnormality of coppermetabolism has been suggested. Death occurs due to hepaticfailure within a year of diagnosis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Five histologic types of\\nICC have been distinguished of which type II is the mostcommon. This form is characterised by the followingfeatures:\\ni) Liver cell injury ranging from ballooning degeneration\\nto significant damage to hepatocytes.\\nii) Prominent Mallory bodies in some hepatocytes without\\nfatty change.\\niii) Neutrophilic and sometimes alongwith lymphocytic\\ninfiltrate.\\niv) Creeping pericellular fibrosis which may eventually\\nlead to fine micro-macro-nodular cirrhosis.\\nv) There is significant deposition of copper and copper-\\nassociated proteins in hepatocytes, often more than whatis seen in Wilson’s disease.\\nThus, the picture resembles acute alcoholic hepatitis\\nbut without the fatty change and with greatly impairedregeneration. There is marked increase in hepatic coppersince the milk consumed by such infants is often boiledand stored in copper vessels in India. The condition hasto be distinguished from Wilson’s disease.\\nCirrhosis in Autoimmune Hepatitis\\nAutoimmune hepatitis (also called lupoid hepatitis) is a form\\nof chronic hepatitis characterised by continued hepatocellularinjury, inflammation and fibrosis which may progress tocirrhosis. The condition may run a variable natural historyrangingfrom indolent to severe rapid course. This form ofhepatitis has prominent autoimmune etiology is supportedby immunologic abnormalities and a few other characteristicdiagnostic criteria as under:1. Female gender predisposition.2.  Predominant elevation of aminotransferases (AST andALT).3.   Hyperglobulinaemia (elevated IgG and γ-globulin).\\n4. High serum titres of nuclear (ANA), smooth muscle (SMA),and liver-kidney microsomal (LKM1) autoantibodies, andabsence of antimitochondrial antibodies.5. Concurrent presence of other autoimmune diseases.6. Presence of HLA DR3 or HLA DR4 markers.7. Lack of prominent elevation of alkaline phosphatase.8. Exclusion of chronic hepatitis of other known etiologies(viral, toxic, genetic etc).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Autoimmune hepatitis ismorphologically indistinguishable from chronic hepatitisof viral etiology. Patients who survive active diseasedevelop crrhosis. There are features of burnt out chronicautoimmune hepatitis accompanied with cirrhosis.\\nCirrhosis in Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis\\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or non-alcoholic fatty\\nliver disease (NAFLD) is a from of hepatitis resemblingalcoholic liver disease but seen in nondrinkers of alcohol.The condition is seen more commonly in affluent westernsocieities, has a strong association with obesity,dyslipidaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is seen inyouger patients with equal gender prevalence. Pateints aregenerally asymptomatic and are diagnosed by routinebiochemical tests.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The condition is a form ofchronic hepatitis after known causes have been excluded.About 10-30% cases of NASH progress to increased fibrosisand develop cirrhosis.\\nMiscellaneous Forms of Cirrhosis\\nIn addition to the various types of cirrhosis just described, a\\nfew other uncommon types associated with different diseasesare sometimes distinguished. These include the following:\\n1.Metabolic disorders  e.g. in galactosaemia, hereditary\\nfructose intolerance, glycogen storage diseases.\\n2. Infectious diseases  e.g. in brucellosis, schistosomiasis,\\nsyphilis (hepar lobatum) and toxoplasma infection.\\n3.\\nGastrointestinal disorders  e.g. in inflammatory bowel\\ndisease, cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and intestinal bypass\\nsurgery for obesity.\\n4. Infiltrative diseases  e.g. in sarcoidosis.\\nCryptogenic Cirrhosis\\nFinally, when all the known etiologic types of cirrhosis have\\nbeen excluded, there remain patients with cirrhosis in whomthe cause is unknown. These cases are grouped under awaste-basket diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis (crypto =\\nconcealed).\\nNON-CIRRHOTIC PORTAL FIBROSIS\\nNon-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) is a group of congenital\\nand acquired diseases in which there is localised or630SECTION III Systemic Pathologygeneralised hepatic fibrosis without nodular regenerative\\nactivity and there is absence of clinical and functionalevidence of cirrhosis. Besides, the patients of NCPF arerelatively young as compared to those of cirrhosis anddevelop repeated bouts of haematemesis in the course ofdisease. One of the types associated with increased portalfibrosis without definite cirrhosis is seen in idiopathic\\n(primary) portal hypertension with splenomegaly,  reported from\\nIndia and Japan. The type common in India, particularly inyoung males, is related to chronic arsenic ingestion  in drinking\\nwater and intake of orthodox medicines. It could also be dueto portal vein thrombosis leading to intimal sclerosis of portalvein branches. Another variant is congenital hepatic fibrosis\\nseen in polycystic disease of the liver.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the liver is small,\\nfibrous and shows prominent fibrous septa on bothexternal as well as on cut surface forming irregular islandsin the liver.\\nHistologically,  the salient features are as under:\\ni) Standing out of portal tracts due to their increased\\namount of fibrous tissue in triad without significantinflammation.ii) Obliterative sclerosis of portal vein branches in theportal tracts (obliterative portovenopathy).\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS ANDCOMPLICA TIONS OF CIRRHOSIS\\nThe range of clinical features in cirrhosis varies widely, froman asymptomatic state to progressive liver failure and death.The onset of disease is insidious. In general, the features ofcirrhosis are more marked in the alcoholic form than in othervarieties. These include weakness, fatiguability, weight loss,anorexia, muscle wasting, and low-grade fever due tohepatocellular necrosis or some latent infection. Advancedcases develop a number of complications which are asfollows:1.Portal hypertension  and its major effects such as ascites,\\nsplenomegaly and development of collaterals (e.g.oesophageal varices, spider naevi etc) as discussed below.2.Progressive hepatic failure  and its manifestations as\\ndescribed already (page 602).3.Development of hepatocellular carcinoma, more often in\\npost-necrotic cirrhosis (HBV and HCV more often) thanfollowing alcoholic cirrhosis (page 634).4.Chronic relapsing pancreatitis,  especially in alcoholic liver\\ndisease (page 646).5.Steatorrhoea  due to reduced hepatic bile secretion.\\n6.Gallstones  usually of pigment type, are seen twice more\\nfrequently in patients with cirrhosis than in generalpopulation.7.Infections  are more frequent in patients with cirrhosis due\\nto impaired phagocytic activity of reticuloendothelial system.8.Haematologic derangements  such as bleeding disorders and\\nanaemia due to impaired hepatic synthesis of coagulationfactors and hypoalbuminaemia are present.9.Cardiovascular complications  such as atherosclerosis of\\ncoronaries and aorta and myocardial infarction are morefrequent in cirrhotic patients.10. Musculoskeletal abnormalities  like digital clubbing,\\nhypertrophic osteoarthropathy and Dupuytren’s contractureare more common in cirrhotic patients.\\n11. Endocrine disorders.  In males these consist of feminisation\\nsuch as gynaecomastia, changes in pubic hair pattern,\\ntesticular atrophy and impotence, whereas in cirrhoticwomen amenorrhoea is a frequent abnormality.\\n12. Hepatorenal syndrome  leading to renal failure may occur\\nin late stages of cirrhosis.\\nThe ultimate causes of death  are hepatic coma, massive\\ngastrointestinal haemorrhage from oesophageal varices\\n(complication of portal hypertension), intercurrent infections,hepatorenal syndrome and development of hepatocellularcarcinoma.\\nPORT A\\nL HYPERTENSION\\nIncrease in pressure in the portal system usually follows\\nobstruction to the portal blood flow anywhere along itscourse. Portal veins have no valves and thus obstructionanywhere in the portal system raises pressure in all the veinsproximal to the obstruction. However, unless provedotherwise, portal hypertension means obstruction to theportal blood flow by cirrhosis of the liver. The normal portalvenous pressure is quite low (10-15 mm saline). Portal\\nhypertension occurs when the portal pressure is above 30mm saline. Measurement of intrasplenic pressure  reflects\\npressure in the splenic vein; the  percutaneous transhepatic\\npressure  provides a measure of pressure in the main portal\\nvein; and wedged hepatic venous pressure  represents\\nsinusoidal pressure. Measurement of these pressures helpsin localising the site of obstruction and classifying the portalhypertension.\\nCLASSIFICATION.\\n Based on the site of obstruction to\\nportal venous blood flow, portal hypertension is categorised\\ninto 3 main types— intrahepatic, posthepatic  and prehepatic\\n(Table 21.10).  Rare cases of idiopathic portal hypertension\\nshowing non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis are encountered asdiscussed above.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.10: Major Causes of Portal Hypertension.\\nA.

Myelofibrosis4. Congenital absence of portal vein631CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas1. Intrahepatic portal hypertension.  Cirrhosis is by far the\\ncommonest cause of portal hypertension. Other less frequent\\nintrahepatic causes are metastatic tumours, non-cirrhoticnodular regenerative conditions, hepatic venous obstruction(Budd-Chiari syndrome), veno-occlusive disease,schistosomiasis, diffuse granulomatous diseases and\\nextensive fatty change. In cirrhosis and other conditions,\\nthere is obstruction to the portal venous flow by fibrosis,thrombosis and pressure by regenerative nodules. About 30-60% patients of cirrhosis develop significant portalhypertension.\\n2. Posthepatic portal hypertension. This is uncommon and\\nresults from obstruction to the blood flow through hepaticvein into inferior vena cava. The causes are neoplasticocclusion and thrombosis of the hepatic vein or of the inferior\\nvena cava (including Budd-Chiari syndrome). Prolonged\\ncongestive heart failure and constrictive pericarditis may alsocause portal hypertension by transmitting the elevatedpressure through the hepatic vessels into the portal vein.\\n3. Prehepatic portal hypertension.  Blockage of portal flow\\nbefore portal blood reaches the hepatic sinusoids results in\\nprehepatic portal hypertension. Such conditions arethrombosis and neoplastic obstruction of the portal veinbefore it ramifies in the liver, myelofibrosis, and congenital\\nabsence of portal vein.\\nMAJOR SEQUELAE OF PORTAL HYPERTENSION.\\nIrrespective of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesisof portal hypertension, there are 4 major clinical conse-quences— ascites, varices  (collateral channels or portosystemic\\nshunts), splenomegaly  and hepatic encephalopathy  (Fig. 21.30) .\\n1.Ascites.  Ascites is the accumulation of excessive volume\\nof fluid within the peritoneal cavity. It frequentlyaccompanies cirrhosis and other diffuse liver diseases. The\\ndevelopment of ascites is associated with haemodilution,\\noedema and decreased urinary output. Ascitic fluid isgenerally transudate with specific gravity of 1.010, proteincontent below 3 gm/dl and electrolyte concentrations likethose of other extracellular fluids. It may contain a fewmesothelial cells and mononuclear cells. Presence of\\nneutrophils is suggestive of secondary infection and red\\nblood cells in ascitic fluid points to disseminated intra-abdominal cancer. However, some cases of ascites maydevelop serious complication of spontaneous bacterial\\nperitonitis  characterised by sponateneous infection of the\\nascitic fluid without any intrabdminal infection.\\nPathogenesis.  The ascites becomes clinically detectable when\\nmore than 500 ml of fluid has accumulated in the peritoneal\\ncavity. The mechanisms involved in its formation were\\ndiscussed in Chapter 5. Briefly, the systemic and local factors\\nfavouring ascites formation are as under (Fig. 21.31) :\\nA. Systemic Factors:\\ni)Decreased plasma colloid oncotic pressure.  There is\\nhypoalbuminaemia from impaired hepatic synthesis of\\nplasma proteins including albumin, as well as from loss ofalbumin from the blood plasma into the peritoneal cavity.\\nHypoalbuminaemia, in turn, causes reduced plasma oncoticpressure and leads to loss of water into extravascular space.ii)Hyperaldosteronism.  In cirrhosis, there is increased\\naldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland, probably due toreduced renal blood flow, and impaired hepatic metabolismand excretion of aldosterone.iii)Impaired renal excretion.  Reduced renal blood flow and\\nexcessive release of antidiuretic hormone results in renalretention of sodium and water and impaired renal excretion.\\nB.\\nLocal  Factors:\\ni)Increased portal pressure.  Portal venous pressure is not\\ndirectly related to ascites formation but portal hypertension\\nin combination with other factors contributes to the formationand localisation of the fluid retention in the peritoneal cavity.\\nii)Increased hepatic lymph formation.  Obstruction of hepatic\\nvein such as in Budd-Chiari syndrome and increased intra-\\nsinusoidal pressure found in cirrhotic patients stimulateshepatic lymph formation that oozes through the surface ofthe liver.\\n2. Varices (Collateral channels or Porto-systemic shunts).\\nAs a result of rise in portal venous pressure and obstructionin the portal circulation within or outside the liver, the bloodtends to bypass the liver and return to the heart bydevelopment of porto-systemic collateral channels (or shuntsor varices). These varices develop at sites where the systemicand portal circulations have common capillary beds. Theprincipal sites are as under:i) Oesophageal varices:  The development of oesophago-\\ngastric varices which is frequently manifested by massiveFigure 21.30 Major clinical consequences of portal hypertension.\\n632SECTION III Systemic Pathologyhaematemesis is the most important consequence of portal\\nhypertension (page 539).ii) Haemorrhoids:  Development of collaterals between the\\nsuperior, middle and inferior haemorrhoidal veins resultingin haemorrhoids is another common accompaniment.Bleeding from haemorrhoids is usually not as serious acomplication as haematemesis from oesophageal varices.iii)Caput medusae:  Anastomoses between the portal and\\nsystemic veins may develop between the hilum of the liverand the umbilicus along the paraumbilical plexus of veinsresulting in abdominal wall collaterals. These appear asdilated subcutaneous veins radiating from the umbilicus andare termed caput medusae (named after the snake-hairedMedusa).iv) Retroperitoneal anastomoses:  In the retroperitoneum,\\nportocaval anastomoses may be established through theveins of Retzius and the veins of Sappey.\\n3. Splenomegaly.  The enlargement of the spleen in\\nprolonged portal hypertension is called congestive\\nsplenomegaly (page 387). The spleen may weigh 500-1000gm and is easily palpable. The spleen is larger in youngpeople and in macronodular cirrhosis than in micronodularcirrhosis.\\n4. Hepatic encephalopathy.  Porto-systemic venous\\nshunting may result in a complex metabolic and organic\\nsyndrome of the brain characterised by disturbed consci-ousness, neurologic signs and flapping tremors. Hepaticencephalopathy is particularly associated with advancedhepatocellular disease such as in cirrhosis.\\nHEPATIC TUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nThe liver is the site for benign tumours, tumour-like lesions,\\nand both primary and metastatic malignant tumours.However, metastatic tumours are much more common thanprimary tumours and tumour-like lesions. Primary hepatictumours may arise from hepatic cells, bile duct epithelium,  or\\nmesodermal structures (Table 21.11).\\nTUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nThese include cysts in the liver and focal nodular hyperplasia.\\nHepatic Cysts\\nCysts in the liver may be single or multiple. These cysts are\\nmainly of 3 types—congenital, simple (nonparasitic) andhydatid (Echinococcus) cysts.\\n1. CONGENITAL CYSTS.  These are uncommon. They are\\nusually small (less than 1 cm in diameter) and are lined bybiliary epithelium. They may be single, or occur as polycysticliver disease, often associated with polycystic kidney. Onoccasions, these cysts have abundant connective tissue and\\nFigure 21.31 Mechanisms of ascites formation in cirrhosis.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.11: Classification of Primary Hepatic Tumours.\\nBenign Malignant\\nA.

SIMPLE (NON-PARASITIC) CYSTS.  Simple cysts are\\nsolitary non-parasitic cysts seen more frequently in middle-\\naged women. The cyst is usually large (up to 20 cm indiameter), lying underneath the Glisson’s capsule and filledwith serous fluid. The cyst produces a palpable mass andmay be associated with jaundice.\\nHistologically,  the cyst wall is composed of compact\\nfibrous tissue and is lined by low columnar to cuboidepithelium and occasionally by squamous lining.\\n3. HYDATID (ECHINOCOCCUS) CYSTS.  Hydatid cyst\\nhas already been discussed on page 616.\\nFocal Nodular Hyperplasia\\nThe etiology  of focal nodular hyperplasia is not known but\\nthese lesions are more common in women taking oral\\ncontraceptives.\\nGrossly, Focal nodular hyperplasia is a well-demarcated\\ntumour-like nodule occurring underneath the Glisson’scapsule. The nodules may be single or multiple,measuring about 5 cm in diameter. It may be tan-yellowor bile-stained. The sectioned surface shows a centralfibrous scar.Histologically,  it is composed of collagenous septa\\nradiating from the central fibrous scar which separatenodules of normal hepatocytes without portal triads orcentral hepatic veins. The fibrous septa contain prominentlymphocytic infiltrate.\\nBENIGN HEPATIC TUMOURS\\nThese are uncommon and some of them are incidental\\nautopsy findings. These include hepatocellular (liver cell)adenoma, bile duct adenoma (cholangioma) andhaemangioma.\\nHepatocellular (Liver Cell) Adenoma\\nAdenomas arising from hepatocytes are rare and are reported\\nin women in reproductive age group in association with useof oral contraceptives, sex hormone therapy and withpregnancy. The tumour presents as intrahepatic mass thatmay be mistaken for hepatocellular carcinoma and mayrupture causing severe intraperitoneal haemorrhage.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour\\nusually occurs singly but about 10% are multiple. It ispartly or completely encapsulated and slightly lighter incolour than adjacent liver or may be bile-stained. Thetumours vary from a few centimetres up to 30 cm indiameter. On cut section, many of the tumours havevarying degree of infarction and haemorrhage.Histologically,  liver cell adenomas are composed of sheets\\nand cords of hepatocytes which may be normal-lookingor may show slight variation in size and shape but nomitoses. The hepatocytes in adenomas contain greateramount of glycogen than the surrounding liver cells andmay sometimes show fatty change. Hepatocellularadenomas lack portal tracts and bile ducts but bilecanaliculi containing bile-plugs may be present.Numerous blood vessels are generally present in thetumour which may be thrombosed. Thrombosis leads toinfarction and may result in rupture with intraperitonealhaemorrhage.\\nBile Duct Adenoma (Cholangioma)\\nIntrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct adenoma is a rare\\nbenign tumour. The tumour may be small, composed of acinilined by biliary epithelium and separated by variable amountof connective tissue, or are larger cystadenomas having loculilined by biliary epithelium.\\nHaemangioma\\nHaemangioma is the commonest benign tumour of the liver.\\nMajority of them are asymptomatic and discoveredincidentally. Rarely, a haemangioma may rupture into theperitoneal cavity.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  haemangiomas\\nappear as solitary or multiple, circumscribed, red-purplelesions, commonly subcapsular and varying from a fewmillimetres to a few centimetres in diameter. They are\\ncommonly cavernous type giving the sectioned surface a\\nspongy appearance.Histologically,  haemangioma of the liver shows\\ncharacteristic large, cavernous, blood-filled spaces, linedby a single layer of endothelium and separated byconnective tissue ( Fig. 21.32 ). Some haemangiomas\\nmay undergo progressive fibrosis and may later getcalcified.\\nMALIGNANT HEPATIC TUMOURS\\nAmong the primary malignant tumours of the liver,\\nhepatocellular (liver cell) carcinoma accounts for approxi-mately 85% of all primary malignant tumours,cholangiocarcinoma for about 5-10%, and infrequently mixedpattern is seen. The remainder are rare tumours that includehepatoblastoma, haemangiosarcoma (angiosarcoma) andembryonal sarcoma. Hepatic haemangiosarcoma andembryonal sarcoma resemble in morphology with theircounterparts elsewhere in the body.\\nHepatocellular Carcinoma\\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver cell carcinoma, also\\ntrmed as hepatoma, is the most common primary malignanttumour of the liver. The tumour shows marked geographicvariations in incidence which is closely related to HBV andHCV infection in the region. Whereas the prevalence of HCCis less than 1% of all autopsies in the United States andEurope, the incidence in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East634SECTION III Systemic PathologyAsia (particularly China) is high (2-8%). Liver cell cancer is\\nmore common in males than in females in the ratio of 4:1.The peak incidence occurs in 5th to 6th decades of life but inhigh incidence areas where HBV and HCV infection is\\nprevalent, it occurs a decade or two earlier. The tumour\\nsupervenes on cirrhosis in 70-80% of cases.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  A number of etiologic factors are\\nimplicated in the etiology of HCC, most important being HBV\\nand HCV infection, and association with cirrhosis.\\n1.Relation to HBV infection.  Genesis of HCC is linked to\\nprolonged infection with HBV. The evidence in support is\\nboth epidemiologic and direct.\\ni)The incidence of HBsAg positivity is higher in HCC\\npatients. For example, in Taiwan, HBsAg-positive carriershave more than 200 times greater risk of developing HCC\\nthan HBsAg-negative patients, particularly when the\\ninfection is acquired in early life.i\\ni) In African and Asian patients, 95% cases of HCC have\\nanti-HBc.\\niii) There is more direct evidence of integration of HBV-DNA\\ngenome in the genome of tumour cells of HCC.\\n2. Relation to HCV infection.  Long-standing HCV infection\\nhas emereged as a major factor in the etiology of HCC,\\ngenerally after more than 30 years of infection. The evidencesin support are as under:\\ni) In developed countries where higher incidence of HCC\\nwas earlier attributed to endemic HBV infection (e.g. inJapan) has shown a remarkable shift to HCV infection.However, in developing countries HBV is still the\\npredominant etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of HCC.\\nii) The patients having anti-HCV and anti-HBc antibodiestogether have three times higher risk of developing HCC thanin those with either antibody alone.\\niii) HCV infection after a long interval produces cirrohosis\\nmore often prior to development of HCC, while in HCCfollowing HBV infection half the cases have cirrohosis and\\nremainder have chronic hepatitis.iv) It is also possible that HBV and HCV infection actsynergistically to predispose to HCC.\\n3. Relation to cirrhosis.  Cirrhosis of all etiologic types is\\nmore commonly associated with HCC but the most frequent\\nassociation is with macronodular post-necrotic cirrhosis. Themechanism of progression to HCC appears to be chronicregenerative activity in cirrhosis, or that the damaged liverin cirrhosis is rendered vulnerable to carcinogenic influences.Liver cell dysplasia  identified by cellular enlargement, nuclear\\nhyperchromatism and multinucleate cells, is found in 60%of cirrhotic livers with HCC and in only 10% of non-cirrhoticlivers.\\n4. Relation to alcohol.  It has been observed that alcoholics\\nhave about four-fold increased risk of developing HCC. It is\\npossible that alcohol may act as co-carcinogen with HBV orHCV infection, but alcohol does not appear to be a hepaticcarcinogen per se.\\n5. Mycotoxins.  An important mycotoxin, aflatoxin B1,\\nproduced by a mould Aspergillus flavus, can contaminate\\npoorly stored wheat grains or groundnuts, especially in deve-loping countries. Aflatoxin B1 is carcinogenic; it may act asa co-carcinogen with hepatitis B or may suppress the cellularimmune response.\\n6. Chemical carcinogens.  A number of chemical carci-\\nnogens can induce liver cancer in experimental animals.\\nThese include butter-yellow and nitrosamines used ascommon food additives.\\n7. Miscellaneous factors.  Limited role of various other\\nfactors in HCC has been observed. These include the\\nfollowing:i) haemochromatosis;ii)α-1-antitrypsin deficiency;\\niii)prolonged immunosuppressive therapy in renal\\ntransplant patients;iv) other types of viral hepatitis;v) tobacco smoking; andvi) parasitic infestations such as clonorchiasis andschistosomiasis.Figure 21.32 Cavernous haemangioma of the liver.\\n635CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine PancreasPathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma can be explained\\non the basis of genetic mutations induced by one of the above\\nmajor etiologic factors. In many cases, this mutated gene hasbeen identified as inactivation of tumour suppressoroncogene p53 by HBV that results in disruption of normal\\ngrowth control. In this regards, the role of X-protein (HBxAg)generated from X-gene of HBV has been found to contributeto carcinogenesis by binding to p53.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  HCC may form\\none of the following 3 patterns of growth, in decreasingorder of frequency (Fig. 21.33) :\\ni)Expanding type:  Most frequently, it forms a single,\\nyellow-brown, large mass,  most often in the right lobe of\\nthe liver with central necrosis, haemorrhage andoccasional bile-staining (Fig. 21.34) . It may be deceptively\\nencapsulated.ii)Multifocal type:  Less often, multifocal, multiple masses,\\n3-5 cm in diameter, scattered throughout the liver are seen.iii)Infiltrating (Spreading) type:  Rarely, the HCC forms\\ndiffusely infiltrating tumour mass.Microscopically,  the tumour cells in the typical HCC\\nresemble hepatocytes but vary with the degree ofdifferentiation, ranging from well-differentiated to highlyanaplastic lesions. Most of the HCC have trabeculargrowth pattern. The tumour cells have a tendency toinvade and grow along blood vessels. Thus importantdiagnostic features are the patterns of tumour cells  and their\\ncytologic features :\\n1.Histologic patterns:  These include the following:\\ni)Trabecular or sinusoidal pattern  is the most common. The\\ntrabeculae are made up of 2-8 cell wide layers of tumourcells separated by vascular spaces or sinusoids which areendothelium-lined (Fig. 21.35) .\\nii)Pseudoglandular or acinar pattern  is seen sometimes. The\\ntumour cells are disposed around central cystic spaceformed by degeneration and breakdown in solidtrabeculae.iii)Compact pattern  resembles trabecular pattern but the\\ntumour cells form large solid masses with inconspicuoussinusoids.iv)Scirrhous pattern  is characterised by more abundant\\nfibrous stroma.2Cytologic features:  The typical cytologic features in\\nthe HCC consist of cells resembling hepatocytes havingvesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasmis granular and eosinophilic but becomes increasinglybasophilic with increasing malignancy. Aside from thesefeatures, a few other cytologic variants are: pleomorphism,bizarre giant cell formation, spindle-shaped cells, tumourcells with clear cytoplasm, presence of bile within dilatedcanaliculi, and intracytoplasmic Mallory’s hyalin.\\nImmunohistochemically, hepatocellular carcinoma cells\\nstain positively with AFP, EMA, keratin etc.\\nFIBROLAMELLAR CARCINOMA.  A clinicopathologic\\nvariant of the HCC is fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver\\nfound in young people of both sexes. The tumour forms a\\nFigure 21.33 Macroscopic patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma.\\nFigure 21.34 Hepatocellular carcinoma.

Hepatic cancer may remain\\nundetected initially because it often occurs in patients with\\nunderlying cirrhosis. The usual features consist ofhepatomegaly with palpable mass in the liver, right upperquadrant pain or tenderness, and less often, jaundice, feverand haemorrhage from oesophageal varices. Ascites withRBCs and malignant cells is found in about half the patients.Rarely, systemic endocrine manifestations due to paraneo-plastic syndrome are eobsereved such as hypercalcaemia,hypoglycaemia, gynaecomastia and acquired porphyria.\\nLaboratory findings yield nonspecific results like\\nanaemia, markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase asfound in cirrhosis, and high serum alpha-foetoprotein (AFP).Elevated AFP level is quite specific; very high levels of AFP(above 500 ng/ml) are observed in 70-80% cases of HCC butlacks sensitivity since AFP is also found elevated in yolk sactumour, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, massive liver necrosisand normal pregnancy. Ultrasound of the liver has beenreported to be more sensitive than elevated AFP level. Anabnormal type of prothrombin, des- γ-carboxy prothrombin,\\nis also elevated and correlates well with AFP levels.\\nSPREAD.  The HCC can have both intrahepatic and\\nextrahepatic spread which faithfully reproduces the structure\\nof the primary tumour:\\nIntrahepatic  spread  occurs by haematogenous route and\\nforms multiple metastases in the liver.\\nExtrahepatic spread  occurs via hepatic or portal veins to\\ndifferent sites, chiefly to lungs and bones, and by lymphaticroute to regional lymph nodes at the porta hepatis and tomediastinal and cervical lymph nodes.\\nThe causes of death from the HCC are cachexia, massive\\nbleeding from oesophageal varices, and liver failure withhepatic coma.\\nCholangiocarcinoma\\nCholangiocarcinoma is the designation used for carcinoma\\narising from bile duct epithelium within the liver (peripheral\\ncholangiocarcinoma). Carcinomas arising from the large hilar\\nducts (hilar cholangiocarcinoma)  and from extrahepatic ducts\\nare termed bile duct carcinomas  (page 644). None of the\\netiologic factors related to HCC have any role in the genesisof cholangiocarcinoma. However, the etiological factorsinvolved in it are exposure to radio-opaque dye thorotrast,anabolic steroids, clonorchiasis and fibrocystic disease. Thetumour affects older people and the clinical features are thoseof HCC but with prominence of jaundice.Figure 21.35 Hepatocellular carcinoma, typical microscopic pattern. The tumour cells resembling hepatocytes show pleomorphism and are\\nseen forming 2-8 cell wide trabeculae which are separated by endothelium-lined sinusoidal spaces.\\nFigure 21.36 Fibrolamellar carcinoma liver.\\n637CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine PancreasMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nfirm to hard and whitish.\\nMicroscopically, the tumour has glandular structure. Thetumour cells resemble biliary epithelium but without bilesecretion. They form various patterns such as tubular,\\nductular or papillary. The stroma consists of fibrous tissue\\nwith little or no capillary formation. Occasionally,mucinous, signet-ring and adenosquamous type ofpatterns are found. An uncommon variant is combined\\nhepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma.\\nHepatoblastoma (Embryoma)\\nHepatoblastoma is a rare malignant tumour arising from\\nprimitive hepatic parenchymal cells. It presents before the\\nage of 2 years as progressive abdominal distension withanorexia, failure to thrive, fever and jaundice. It is morecommon in boys. The concentration of serum AFP is high.\\nThe tumour grows rapidly and causes death by\\nhaemorrhage, hepatic failure or widespread metastases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES, Grossly,  the tumour is\\ncircumscribed and lobulated mass measuring 5-25 cm in\\nsize, having areas of cystic degeneration, haemorrhageand necrosis.\\nMicroscopically,  hepatoblastoma consists of 2\\ncomponents:\\ni) Epithelial component  contains 2 types of cells—\\n‘embryonal’ hepatocytes  are small with dark-staining,\\nhyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm, and ‘foetal’\\nhepatocytes  are larger with more cytoplasm that may be\\ngranular or clear. The epithelial cells are organised intrabeculae, ribbons or rosettes.\\nii)Mesenchymal component  includes fibrous connective\\ntissue, cartilage and osteoid of variable degree of\\nmaturation. Extramedullary haematopoiesis is a frequentaccompaniment.\\nSecondary Hep\\natic Tumours\\nMetastatic tumours in the liver are more common than theprimary hepatic tumours. Most frequently, they are blood-\\nborne metastases, irresp ective of whether the primary\\ntumour is drained by portal vein or systemic veins. Mostfrequent primary tumours metastasising to the liver, in\\ndescending order of frequency, are those of stomach, breast,lungs, colon, oesophagus, pancreas, malignant melanoma\\nand haematopoietic malignancies. Sarcomas rarely\\nmetastasise to the liver. Occasionally, metastatic involvementmay be present in the absence of obvious evidence of primarytumour. Aside from general features of disseminated\\nmalignancy such as anorexia, cachexia and anaemia, the\\npatients have hepatomegaly with nodular free margin. Thereis little hepatic dysfunction until late in the course of hepaticmetastatic disease.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  most metastatic\\ncarcinomas form multiple, spherical, nodular masseswhich are of variable size. Liver is enlarged and heavy,weighing 5 kg or more. The tumour deposits are white,well-demarcated, soft or haemorrhagic. The surface of the\\nliver shows characteristic umbilication due to central\\nnecrosis of nodular masses (Fig. 21.37) .\\nHistologically,  the metastatic tumours generally\\nreproduce the structure of the primary lesions (Fig. 21.38) .Figure 21.37 Metastatic tumour deposits in the liver as seen on sectioned surface. Characteristic features include multiple, variable-sized,\\nnodular masses, often under the capsule, producing umbilication on the surface.\\nFigure 21.38 Metastatic deposits from undifferentiated sarcoma in\\nthe liver.\\n638SECTION III Systemic PathologyBILIARY SYSTEM\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nANATOMY.  The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ, 9 cm\\nin length and has a capacity of approximately 50 ml. It\\nconsists of the fundus, body  and neck that tapers into the cystic\\nduct. The two hepatic ducts from right and left lobes of the\\nliver unite at the porta hepatis to form the common hepaticduct which is joined by the cystic duct from the gallbladderto form the common bile duct. The common bile duct entersthe second part of the duodenum posteriorly. In about 70%of cases, it is joined by the main pancreatic duct to form thecombined opening in the duodenum (ampulla of Vater).  In\\n30% cases, the common bile duct and the pancreatic ductopen separately into the duodenum (see Fig. 21.1). The\\ncommon bile duct in its duodenal portion is surrounded bylongitudinal and circular muscles derived from theduodenum forming sphincter of Oddi.\\nHISTOLOGY. Histologically,  the gallbladder, unlike the rest\\nof gastrointestinal tract, lacks the muscularis mucosae andsubmucosa. The wall of the gallbladder is composed of thefollowing 4 layers:\\n1.Mucosal layer:  It has a single layer of tall columnar\\nepithelium which is thrown into permanent folds that are\\nlarger and more numerous in the neck of the gallbladder.Beneath the epithelium is delicate lamina propria thatcontains capillaries, and in the region of the neck, a few acinarglands are present.\\n2.\\nSmooth muscle layer:  External to the lamina propria are\\nsmooth muscle bundles in layers—inner longitudinal, middle\\noblique, and outer circular.\\n3. Perimuscular layer:  Outer to the muscle layer is a zone\\nof fibrous connective tissue with some interspersed fat cells.4. Perimuscular layer:  The perimuscular layer is covered\\nby serosa on the peritoneal surface of the gallbladder. The\\nperitoneum covers the gallbladder except in the region ofgallbladder fossa where it is embedded in the liver.\\nThe extrahepatic bile ducts  are also lined by tall columnar\\nepithelium that overlies the lamina propria. It is surroundedby dense layer of fibromuscular tissue. The ducts which liebetween the lobules of the liver and receive bile from thecanaliculi are lined by cuboidal or flattened cells.\\nFUNCTIONS.  The main function of the gallbladder is to\\nstore and concentrate the bile secreted by the liver and then\\ndeliver it into the intestine for digestion and absorption of\\nfat. The concentrating ability of the gallbladder is due to its\\nabsorptive mucosal surface that has numerous folds.Normally, the liver secretes approximately 500 ml of bile per\\nday and the gallbladder concentrates it 5-10 times. Themotility, concentration and relaxation of the gallbladder areunder the influence of a peptide hormone, cholecystokinin,\\nreleased from neuroendocrine cells of the duodenum and\\njejunum.\\nCONGENIT A\\nL ANOMALIES\\nSeveral uncommon congenital anomalies of the biliary\\nsystem have been described. These include: agenesis,duplication and heterotopic tissue. However, congenital cystic\\nlesions  of the bile ducts (as also of the liver) are more\\nfrequently diagnosed. These conditions include: congenitalintrahepatic biliary dilatation (Caroli’s disease), choledochalcysts, polycystic liver disease and congenital hepatic fibrosis.They are found in various combinations and are usuallyinherited. All of them may be complicated by malignantchange.\\nCHOLELITHIASIS (GALLSTONES)\\nGallstones are formed from constituents of the bile (viz.\\ncholesterol, bile pigments and calcium salts) along with otherorganic components. Accordingly, the gallstones commonlycontain cholesterol, bile pigment and calcium salts in varyingproportions. They are usually formed in the gallbladder, butsometimes may develop within extrahepatic biliary passages,and rarely in the larger intrahepatic bile duct.\\nRISK FACTORS.  The incidence of gallstones varies\\nmarkedly in different geographic areas, age, gender, diet and\\nvarious other risk factors. These factors which largely pertainto cholesterol stones can be summed up in the old sayingthat gallstones are common in 4F’s acronym for— ‘fat, female,\\nfertile (multipara)  and forty’.  Some of the risk factors in\\nlithogenesis are explained below:\\n1.Geography.  Gallstones are quite prevalent in almost the\\nentire Western world. American Indians have the highest\\nknown prevalence. Black Africans and populations in theEastern world are relatively free of cholelithiasis.\\n2.Genetic factors.  There is increased frequency of gall-\\nstones in first-degree relatives of patients with cholelithiasis.\\nPatients of gallstones disease have increased secretion ofdietary cholesterol  in bile than in non-gallstone patientsinspite of high-cholesterol diet. Recently, mutation inCYP7A1  gene has been found that results in deficiency of\\nenzyme, cholesterol 7-hydroxylase, which has a role in bileacid synthesis. This mutation is associated with hypercholes-terolaemia and gallstones.\\n3\\n. Age.  There is steady increase in the prevalence of\\ngallstones with advancing age which may be related to\\nincreased cholesterol content in the bile. The incidenceincreases above the age of 40 and presentation is usually inthe 50s and 60s.\\n4. Sex.  Gallstones are twice more frequent in women than\\nin men. In the United States, autopsy series have shown\\ngallstones in about 20% of women and 8% of men above the\\nage of 40. The incidence is higher in multiparous womenthan in nulliparous women.\\n5. Drugs.  Women on oestrogen therapy or on birth control\\npills have higher incidence of gallstones. This is considered\\nto be due to production of more lithogenic bile as a result ofcholestatic effect of oestrogen. Similar is the influence ofclofibrate used for lowering blood cholesterol.\\n6. Obesity.  Obesity is associated with increased cholesterol\\nsynthesis and its excretion resulting in higher incidence of\\ngallstones in obese patients.\\n7. Diet.  Deficiency of dietary fibre content is linked to higher\\nprevalence of gallstones. A moderate consumption of alcohol,\\nhowever, seems to protect against gallstones.639CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreas8. Gastrointestinal diseases.  Certain gastrointestinal\\ndisorders such as Crohn’s disease, ileal resection, ileal bypass\\nsurgery etc are associated with interruption in enterohepaticcirculation followed by gallstone formation.\\n9. Factors in pigment gallstones.  All the above factors apply\\nlargely to cholesterol stones. Pigment stones, whether pure\\nor mixed type, are more frequently associated withhaemolytic anaemias which lead to increased content ofunconjugated bilirubin in the bile. Pigment stones are alsomore frequent in cirrhosis and hepatocellular disease.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The mechanism of gallstone formation\\n(i.e. lithogenesis) is explained separately below under 2\\nheadings: firstly  for cholesterol, mixed gallstones and biliary\\nsludge; and, secondly   for pigment gallstones as under:\\nPATHOGENESIS OF CHOLESTEROL, MIXED GALL-STONES AND BILIARY SLUDGE.  Cholesterol is essentially\\ninsoluble in water and can be solublised by another lipid.Normally, cholesterol and phospholipids (lecithin) aresecreted into bile as ‘bilayered vesicles’ but are convertedinto ‘mixed miscelles’ by addition of bile acids, the thirdconstituent. If there is excess of cholesterol compared to theother two constituents, unstable cholesterol-rich vesiclesremain behind which aggregate and form cholesterolcrystals. Formation of such lithogenic (stone-forming) bileis explained by the following mechanisms (Fig. 21.39) :\\n1.Supersaturation of bile: Several etiologic factors listed\\nabove favour increased secretion of cholesterol in thepresence of normal bile acids and lecithin in the bile as themajor mechanism for initiation of gallstone formation. Thesefactors cause enhanced activity of enzyme, HMG-CoAreductase, that normally regulates cholesterol synthesis andits hepatic uptake. Two other disturbances which maycontribute to supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol areas under:i) Reduced bile acid pool : This causes rapid loss of the available\\nbile acids into the small intestine and then into the colon,resulting in supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol.ii) Increased conversion of cholic acid to deoxycholic acid:  This\\ncauses increased secretion of deoxycholate in the bile whichis associated with hypersecretion of cholesterol into the bile.\\nMutation in MDR3  gene has been found that causes\\ndefect in phospholipid secretion from bile, resulting incholesterol supersaturation of bile and cholesterol gallstoneformation. Although supersaturation of the bile withcholesterol is an important pre-requisite for lithogenesis, thisin itself is not sufficient for cholesterol precipitation.\\n2. Cholesterol nucleation.  Initiation of cholesterol stones\\noccurs by nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals.\\nAccelerated nucleation of cholesterol monohydrate mayoccur either from pro-nucleating factors or from deficiencyof anti-nucleating factors:i) Pro-nucleating factors  are mucin and non-mucin\\nglycoproteins secreted by epithelial cells of the gallbladder. ii) Anti-nucleating factors\\n are apolipoproteins AI and AII, and\\nsome glycoproteins.\\nCholesterol monohydrate nucleation probably occurs in\\nthe mucin gel layer of the gallbladder followed by continuedaddition and precipitation of more crystals resulting in solidstate crystals.\\n3. Gallbladder hypomotility.  Normally, the gallbladder is\\ncapable of emptying and clearing any sludge or debris which\\nmight initiate stone formation. This takes place under theinfluence of cholecystokinin secreted from small intestine.\\nHowever, the motility of gallbladder may be impaired dueto decrease in cholecystokinin receptors in the gallbladderresulting in stasis of biliary sludge and lithogenesis. A defectin gallbladder emptying has been found to play a role inrecurrence of gall-stone formation in patients who undergobiliary lithotripsy.\\nPATHOGENESIS OF PIGMENT GALLSTONES.  The\\nmechanism of pigment stone formation is explained on the\\nbasis of following factors:i) Chronic haemolysis resulting in increased level ofunconjugated bilirubin in the bile.ii) Alcoholic cirrhosis.\\niii) Chronic biliary tract infection e.g. by parasitic infestationsof the biliary tract such as by Clonorchis sinensis  and Ascaris\\nlumbricoides.iv) Demographic and genetic factors e.g. in rural setting andprevalence in Asian countries.\\nTYPES OF GALLSTONES.  As stated before, gallstones\\ncontain cholesterol, bile pigment and calcium carbonate,\\neither in pure form or in various combinations. Accordingly,gallstones are of 3 major types— pure gallstones, mixed\\ngallstones  and combined gallstones.  Mixed gallstones are theFigure 21.39 Schematic pathogenesis of gallstone formation. (HMG-\\nCoAR = hydroxy methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; 7α -OHase =\\ncholesterol 7 α-OHase hydroxylase; MDR3 = multidrug resistance-\\nassociated protein 3).\\n640SECTION III Systemic Pathologymost common (80%) while pure and combined gallstones\\ncomprise 10% each. In general, gallstones are formed mostfrequently in the gallbladder but may occur in extrahepaticas well as intrahepatic biliary passages. Gallbladdercontaining pure stones shows no significant inflammatoryreaction, whereas chronic cholecystitis is invariably presentin gallbladder with either mixed or combined gallstones.Presence of calcium salts renders gallstones radio-opaque,while cholesterol stones appear as radiolucent filling defectsin the gallbladder.\\nThe salient features of various types of gallstones are\\nsummarised in Table 21.12  and presented below:\\n1.Pure gallstones.  They constitute about 10% of all\\ngallstones. They are further divided into 3 types accordingto the component of bile forming them. These are as under(Fig. 21.40) :\\ni\\n) Pure cholesterol gallstones:  They are usually solitary, oval\\nand fairly large (3 cm or more) filling the gallbladder. Theirsurface is hard, smooth, whitish-yellow and glistening. Oncut section, the pure cholesterol stone shows radiatingglistening crystals. It may result in deposition of cholesterolwithin the mucosal macrophages of the gallbladderproducing cholesterolosis  which is an asymptomatic condition\\n(Fig. 21.41) .\\n Pure cholesterol stones are radiolucent but 10-\\n20% of them have calcium carbonate in them which rendersthem opaque.ii) Pure pigment gallstones: These stones composed primarilyof bile pigment, calcium bilirubinate, and contain less than20% cholesterol. They are generally multiple, jet-black andsmall (less than 1 cm in diameter). They have mulberry likeexternal surface. They are soft and can be easily crushed.The gallbladder usually appears uninvolved.iii) Pure calcium carbonate gallstones:  They are rare. Calcium\\ncarbonate gallstones are usually multiple, grey-white, small(less than 1 cm in diameter), faceted and fairly hard due tocalcium content. They, too, do not produce any change inthe gallbladder wall.\\n2. Mixed gallstones.  Mixed gallstones are the most common\\n(80%) and contain more than 50% cholesterol monohydarate\\nplus an admixture of calcium salts, bile pigments and fattyacids. They are always multiple, multifaceted so that theyfit together and vary in size from as tiny as sand-grain to 1cm or more in diameter. On section, they have distinctlaminated structure with alternating dark pigment layer andpale-white layer revealing different combinations ofcholesterol, bilirubin pigment and calcium carbonate, laiddown in layers at different times (Fig. 21.42, A) .\\nMixed gallstones are invariably accompanied by chronic\\ncholecystitis.\\n3.Combined gallstones.  They comprise about 10% of all\\ngallstones. Combined gallstones are usually solitary, large\\nand smooth-surfaced. It has a pure gallstone nucleus\\n(cholesterol, bile pigment or calcium carbonate) and outershell of mixed gallstone; or a mixed gallstone nucleus with pure\\ngallstone shell (Fig. 21.42, B) .\\nCombined gallstones, too, are associated with chronic\\ncholecystitis.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND COMPLICA-\\nTIONS.  In about 50% cases, gallstones cause no symptoms\\nand may be diagnosed by chance during investigations forsome other condition (silent gallstones).  The future course in\\nsuch asymptomatic silent cases is controversial, mostsurgeons advocating cholecystectomy while physiciansadvising watchful waiting. Follow-up studies, however,show that only about 10% of such cases develop symptoms.Symptomatic gallstone disease appears only whencomplications develop. These are as under:\\n1.Cholecystitis.  The relationship between cholelithiasis and\\ncholecystitis is well known but it is not certain which of the\\ntwo comes first. The patients with gallstones developsymptoms due to cholecystitis which include typical biliarycolic precipitated by fatty meal, nausea, vomiting, feveralongwith leucocytosis and high serum bilirubin.\\n2\\n. Choledocholithiasis.  Gallstones may pass down into the\\nextrahepatic biliary passages and the small bowel, or less\\noften they may be formed in the biliary tree. Patients withgallstone in the common bile duct frequently develop painand obstructive jaundice. Fever may develop due to bacterialascending cholangitis.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 21.12: Features of Gallstones.\\nType Frequency Composition Gallbladder Changes Appearance\\n1.\\nPure 10% i) Cholesterol Cholesterolosis Solitary, oval, large, smooth, yellow-\\ngallstones white; on C/S radiating glistening\\ncrystals\\nii) Bile pigment No change Multiple, small, jet-black, mulberry-\\nshaped; on C/S soft black\\niii) Calcium carbonate No change Multiple, small, grey-white, faceted;\\nC/S hard\\n2.

Mucocele.  Mucocele or hydrops of the gallbladder is\\ndistension of the gallbladder by clear, watery mucinous\\nsecretion resulting from impacted stones in the neck of thegallbladder.\\n4. Biliary fistula.  An uncommon complication of\\ncholelithiasis is formation of fistulae between one part of the\\nbiliary system and the bowel, and rarely between thegallbladder and the skin.\\n5. Gallstone ileus.  A gallstone in the intestine may be\\npassed in the faeces without causing symptoms.\\nOccasionally, however, gallstones in the intestine may cause\\nintestinal obstruction called gallstone ileus.\\n6. Gallbladder cancer.  There is a small and doubtful risk\\nof development of cancer of the gallbladder in cases with\\ncholelithiasis (page 643).CHOLECYSTITIS\\nCholecystitis or inflammation of the gallbladder may be\\nacute, chronic, or acute superimposed on chronic. Thoughchronic cholecystitis is more common, acute cholecystitis isa surgical emergency.\\nAcute Cholecystitis\\nIn many ways, acute cholecystitis is similar to acute appen-\\ndicitis. The condition usually begins with obstruction,followed by infection later.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Based on the initiating mechanisms,\\nacute cholecystitis occurs in two types of situations— acute\\ncalculous  and acute acalculous cholecystitis.\\nAcute calculous cholecystitis.  In 90% of cases, acute\\ncholecystitis is caused by obstruction in the neck of the\\ngallbladder or in the cystic duct by a gallstone. The commo-nest location of impaction of a gallstone is in Hartmann’spouch. Obstruction results in distension of the gallbladderfollowed by acute inflammation which is initially due tochemical irritation. Later, however, secondary bacterialinfection, chiefly by E. coli  and Streptococcus faecalis,\\nsupervenes.\\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis.  The remaining 10% cases\\nof acute cholecystitis do not contain gallstones. In such cases,a variety of causes have been assigned such as previousnonbiliary surgery, multiple injuries, burns, recent childbirth,severe sepsis, dehydration, torsion of the gallbladder anddiabetes mellitus. Rare causes include primary bacterialinfection like salmonellosis and cholera and parasiticinfestations.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Except for the presence or\\nabsence of calculi, the two forms of acute cholecystitis aremorphologically similar.\\nGrossly,  the gallbladder is distended and tense. The\\nserosal surface is coated with fibrinous exudate with\\ncongestion and haemorrhages. The mucosa is bright red.The lumen is filled with pus mixed with green bile. Incalculous cholecystitis, a stone is generally impacted inthe neck or in the cystic duct. When obstruction of theFigure 21.40 Pure gallstones of various types.\\nFigure 21.41 Cholesterolosis of the gallbladder. The lamina propria\\nof the mucosa shows foamy macrophages.Figure 21.42 Mixed and combined gallstones.\\n642SECTION III Systemic Pathologycystic duct is complete, the lumen is filled with purulent\\nexudate and the condition is known as empyema of the\\ngallbladder.\\nMicroscopically,  wall of the gallbladder shows marked\\ninflammatory oedema, congestion and neutrophilic\\nexudate. There may be frank abscesses in the wall andgangrenous necrosis with rupture into the peritonealcavity (gangrenous cholecystitis).\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The patients of acute cholecystitis\\nof either type have similar clinical features. They present withsevere pain in the upper abdomen with features of peritonealirritation such as guarding and hyperaesthesia. Thegallbladder is tender and may be palpable. Fever,leucocytosis with neutrophilia and slight jaundice aregenerally present. Early cholecystectomy within the firstthree days has a mortality of less than 0.5% and risk ofcomplications such as perforation, biliary fistula, recurrentattacks and adhesions is avoided. However, medicaltreatment brings about resolution in a fairly large proportionof cases though chances of recurrence of attack persist.\\nChronic Cholecystitis\\nChronic cholecystitis is the commonest type of clinical\\ngallbladder disease. There is almost constant association ofchronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The association of chronic\\ncholecystitis with mixed and combined gallstones is virtually\\nalways present. However, it is not known what initiates theinflammatory response in the gallbladder wall. Possibly,supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol predisposes toboth gallstone formation and inflammation. In some patients,repeated attacks of mild acute cholecystitis result in chroniccholecystitis.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly , the gallbladder\\nis generally contracted but may be normal or enlarged(Fig. 21.43) . The wall of the gallbladder is thickened which\\non cut section is grey-white due to dense fibrosis or maybe even calcified. The mucosal folds may be intact,thickened, or flattened and atrophied. The lumencommonly contains multiple mixed stones or a combinedstone.Histologically,  the features are as under (Fig. 21.44) :\\n1. Thickened and congested mucosa but occasionally\\nmucosa may be totally destroyed.2. Penetration of the mucosa deep into the wall of thegallbladder up to muscularis layer to form Rokitansky-\\nAschoff’sinuses.3.Variable degree of chronic inflammatory reaction,\\nconsisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages,present in the lamina propria and subserosal layer.4\\n. Variable degree of fibrosis in the subserosal and\\nsubepithelial layers.\\nA few morphologic variants of chronic cholecystitis\\nare considered below:\\nCholecystitis glandularis,  when the mucosal folds\\nfuse together due to inflammation and result in formationof crypts of epithelium buried in the gallbladder wall.\\nPorcelain gallbladder  is the pattern when the\\ngallbladder wall is calcified and cracks like an egg-shell.\\nAcute on chronic cholecystitis  is the term used for\\nthe morphologic changes of acute cholecystitissuperimposed on changes of chronic cholecystitis.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Chronic cholecystitis has ill-defined\\nand vague symptoms. Generally, the patient— a fat, fertile,\\nfemale of forty or fifty,  presents with abdominal distension or\\nepigastric discomfort, especially after a fatty meal. There isFigure 21.43 Chronic cholecystitis with cholelithiasis. A, Mixed\\ngallstones, diagrammatic view. The wall of the gallbladder is thickened\\nand the lumen is packed with well-fitting, multiple, multi-faceted, mixedgallstones. B, Chronic cholecystitis with cholesterol cholelithiasis. Thewall of gallbladder is thickened. The lumen contains a single, large, oval,and hard yellow-white gallstone.643CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasa constant dullache in the right hypochondrium and\\nepigastrium and tenderness over the right upper abdomen.Nausea and flatulence are common. Biliary colic mayoccasionally occur due to passage of stone into the bile ducts.Cholecystography usually allows radiologic visualisation ofthe gallstones.\\nTUMOURS OF BILIARY SYSTEM\\nBENIGN TUMOURS\\nBenign tumours such as papilloma, adenoma, adenomyoma,\\nfibroma, lipoma, myxoma, and haemangioma have beendescribed in the biliary tract but all of them are exceedinglyrare.  Adenomyoma  is more common benign tumour than the\\nrest. All these tumours resemble their counterparts inmorphology elsewhere in the body.\\nMALIGNANT TUMOURS\\nCarcinoma of the gallbladder and carcinoma of the bile ducts\\nand ampulla of Vater are among the more frequent malignanttumours of the biliary tract.\\nCarcinoma of the Gallbladder\\nPrimary carcinoma of the gallbladder is more prevalent than\\nother cancers of the extrahepatic biliary tract. Likecholelithiasis and cholecystitis, it is more frequent in womenthan in men (ratio 4:1) with a peak incidence in 7th decadeof life. It may remain undetected until the time it is widelyspread and rendered inoperable.\\nETIOLOGY.  A number of etiologic factors have been\\nimplicated.1.Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.  The most significant\\nassociation of cancer of the gallbladder is with cholelithiasis\\nand cholecystitis, though there is no definite evidence ofcausal relationship. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis arepresent in about 75% cases of gallbladder cancer. On the otherhand, incidence of documented gallbladder cancer in thepresence of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis is about 0.5% only.Porcelain gallbladdder is particularly likely to becomecancerous.\\n2.Chemical carcinogens.  A number of chemical\\ncarcinogens structurally similar to naturally-occurring bile\\nacids have been considered to induce gallbladder cancer.These include methyl cholanthrene, various nitrosaminesand pesticides. Workers engaged in rubber industry havehigher incidence of gallbladder cancer.\\n3.\\nGenetic factors.  There is higher incidence of cancer of\\nthe gallbladder in certain populations living in the same\\ngeographic region suggesting a strong genetic componentin the disease. Japanese immigrants and Native Americansof the South-Western America have increased frequencywhile American Indians and Mexicans have lower incidence.\\n4. Miscellaneous.  Patients who have undergone previous\\nsurgery on the biliary tract have higher incidence of\\nsubsequent gallbladder cancer. Patients with inflammatorybowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) havehigh incidence of gallbladder cancer.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The commonest site is the\\nfundus, followed next in frequency by the neck of thegallbladder (Fig. 21.45) .\\nGrossly,  cancer of the gallbladder is of 2 types—infil-\\ntrating and fungating type (Fig. 21.46) :Figure 21.44 Chronic cholecystitis, microscopic appearance. There is penetration of epithelium-lined spaces into the gallbladder wall (Rokit ansky-\\nAschoff sinus) in an area. There is subepithelial and subserosal fibrosis and hypertrophy of muscularis. Mononuclear inflammato ry cell infiltrate is\\npresent in subepithelial and perimuscular layers.\\n644SECTION III Systemic Pathology1. Infiltrating type  appears as an irregular area of diffuse\\nthickening and induration of the gallbladder wall. It may\\nhave deep ulceration causing direct invasion of thegallbladder wall and liver bed. On section, the gallbladderwall is firm due to scirrhous growth.\\n2. Fungating type  grows like an irregular, friable,\\npapillary or cauliflower-like growth into the lumen as well\\nas into the wall of the gallbladder and beyond.Histologically,  the following patterns are observed:\\n1. Most gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas  (90%).\\nThey may be papillary or infiltrative, well-differentiatedor poorly-differentiated. Most are non-mucin secreting butsome are colloid carcinomas forming mucus pools.\\n2. About 5% of gallbladder cancers are squamous cell\\ncarcinomas  arising from squamous metaplastic epithelium.\\n3. A few cases show both squamous and adeno-\\ncarcinoma pattern of growth called adenosquamous\\ncarcinoma.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Carcinoma of the gallbadder is\\nslow-growing and causes symptoms late in the course ofdisease. Quite often, the diagnosis is made when gallbladderis removed for cholelithiasis. The symptomatic cases havepain, jaundice, noticeable mass, anorexia and weight loss.In such case, the growth has usually invaded the liver andother adjacent organs and has metastasised to regional lymphnodes and more distant sites such as the lung, peritoneumand gastrointestinal tract.\\nCarcinoma of Extrahepatic Bile Ducts and\\nAmpulla of V ater\\nThis is an infrequent neoplasm but is more common thanthe rare benign tumours of the biliary tract. Unlike otherdiseases of the biliary passages, it is more common in maleswith peak incidence in 6th decade of life.\\nETIOLOGY.  There is no association between bile duct\\ncarcinoma and gallstones. Bile duct cancers are associated\\nwith a number of other conditions such as ulcerative colitis,sclerosing cholangitis, parasitic infestations of the bile ductswith Fasciola hepatica  (liver fluke), Ascaris lumbricoides  and\\nClonorchis sinensis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Extrahepatic bile ductcarcinoma may arise anywhere in the biliary tree but themost frequent sites, in descending order of frequency, are:the ampulla of Vater, lower end of common bile duct,hepatic ducts, and the junction of hepatic ducts to formcommon bile duct  (see Fig. 21.45).\\nGrossly,  bile duct carcinoma is usually small, extending\\nfor 1-2 cm along the duct, producing thickening of theaffected duct.Histologically,  the tumour is usually well-differentiated\\nadenocarcinoma which may or may not be mucin-secreting. Perineural invasion is frequently present.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Obstructive jaundice is the usual\\npresenting feature which is characterised by intense pruritus.Pain, steatorrhoea, weight loss and weakness may be present.The tumour usually metastasises to the regional lymphnodes.\\nEXOCRINE PANCREAS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe human pancreas, though anatomically a single organ,\\nhistologically and physiologically has 2 distinct parts—theFigure 21.45 Frequency of cancer in the biliary system.\\nFigure 21.46 Carcinoma gallbladder. The lumen of the gallbladder\\ncontains irregular, friable papillary growth arising from mucosa (arrow).\\nTwo multi-faceted gallstones (mixed) are also present in the lumen.\\n645CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasexocrine  and endocrine parts.  The endocrine part of the gland\\nis dealt with in Chapter 27 while the exocrine gland is\\nconsidered here. The whole of pancreas, exocrine andendocrine, is embryologically derived from the foregutendoderm.\\nANATOMY.  The pancreas lies obliquely in the concavity of\\nthe duodenum as an elongated structure about 15 cm in\\nlength and 100 gm in weight ( see Fig. 21.1). It is subdivided\\ninto 3 topographic zones:\\n1.The head lying in the concavity of the duodenum and the\\nuncinate process  projecting from the head.\\n2.The body  comprises the main part of the gland.\\n3\\n. The tail is the thin, tapering part of the gland towards\\nthe hilum of the spleen.\\nHISTOLOGY.  The exocrine pancreas constitutes 80 to 85%\\nof the total gland, while the endocrine pancreas comprises\\nthe remaining part.\\nThe exocrine part is divided into rhomboid lobules\\nseparated by thin fibrous tissue septa containing bloodvessels, lymphatics, nerves and ducts. Each lobule iscomposed of numerous acini. The acini are lined by pyramid-shaped columnar epithelial cells. These secretory epithelialcells have microvilli projecting into the lumen from theirsurface. The apical portions of these cells contain zymogengranules in their cytoplasm, while the basal region is deeplybasophilic and free of zymogen granules. The zymogengranules are membrane-bound sacs which fuse with theplasma membrane and are then released into the lumina ofthe acini. The secretions are carried from the acini by fineductal branches into the small ducts in the lobules andeventually into the main pancreatic duct. The mainpancreatic duct is formed by fusion of the ventral duct withthe dorsal duct; the latter also called the duct of Wirsung,\\nprovides the main drainage for pancreatic secretions into theduodenum. The pancreatic secretions are delivered into thesecond part of the duodenum either by a combined openingof the pancreatic and bile ducts in the ampulla of Vater, orless often both open separately into the duodenum.Occasionally, the proximal part of the dorsal duct persistsas the duct of Santorini.\\nFUNCTIONS.  The main functions of the exocrine pancreas\\nis the alkaline secretion of digestive enzymes prominentamong which are trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, amylase,lipase and phospholipase.\\nDEVELOPMENTAL ANOMALIES\\nThe significant developmental anomalies of the pancreas are\\nectopic or aberrant pancreatic tissue in Meckel’s diverticulum(page 561), anomalies of the ducts, and cystic fibrosis. Onlythe last named requires elaboration here.\\nCystic Fibrosis\\nCystic fibrosis of the pancreas or fibrocystic disease is a\\nhereditary disorder characterised by viscid mucoussecretions in all the exocrine glands of the body (muco-viscidosis)  and associated with increased concentrations of\\nelectrolytes in the eccrine glands. The terms ‘cystic fibrosis’\\nand ‘fibrocystic disease’ are preferable over ‘mucoviscidosis’\\nin view of the main pathologic change of fibrosis producedas a result of obstruction of the passages by viscid mucoussecretions.\\nThe disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait\\nwith apparent clinical features in homozygotes only. Thedefect is a genetic mutation in CFTR gene, acronym for\\ncoding protein for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance\\nregulator located on chromosome 7. It is quite common in\\nthe whites (1 per 2000 livebirths). The clinical manifestationsmay appear at birth or later in adolescence and pertain tomultiple organs and systems such as pancreatic insufficiency,\\nintestinal obstruction, steatorrhoea, malnutrition, hepatic\\ncirrhosis and respiratory complications.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Depending upon the\\nseverity of involvement and the organs affected, the\\npathologic changes are variable. Most of the changes are\\nproduced as a result of obstruction by viscid mucous.\\n1.Pancreas.  The pancreas is almost invariably involved\\nin cystic fibrosis.\\nGrossly,  pancreatic lobules are ovoid rather than\\nrhomboid. Fatty replacement of the pancreas and grossly\\nvisible cysts may be seen.\\nMicroscopically,  the lobular architecture of pancreatic\\nparenchyma is maintained. There is increased interlobularfibrosis. The acini are atrophic and many of the acinar\\nducts contain laminated, eosinophilic concretions. Rarely,\\ninflammation, fat necrosis and cyst formation may be seen.The islet tissue (endocrine pancreas) generally remainsintact. Atrophy of the exocrine pancreas may cause\\nimpaired fat absorption, steatorrhoea, intestinal\\nobstruction and avitaminosis A.\\n2\\n. Liver.  The bile canaliculi are plugged by viscid\\nmucous which may cause diffuse fatty change, portal\\nfibrosis and ductular proliferation. More severe involve-ment may cause biliary cirrhosis (page 625).\\n3. Respiratory tract. Changes in the respiratory passages\\nare seen in almost all typical cases of cystic fibrosis. The\\nviscid mucous secretions of the submucosal glands of the\\nrespiratory tract cause obstruction, dilatation and infectionof the airways. The changes include chronic bronchitis,bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis, bronchiolectasis,\\nperibronchiolar pneumonia and inflammatory nasal\\npolyps.\\n4. Salivary glands.  Pathologic changes in the salivary\\nglands are similar to those in pancreas and include\\nobstruction of the ducts, dilatation, fibrosis and glandularatrophy.\\n5. Sweat glands. Hypersecretion of sodium and chloride\\nin the sweat observed in these patients may be reflected\\npathologically by diminished vacuolation of the cells of\\neccrine glands.646SECTION III Systemic PathologyPANCREATITIS\\nPancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas with acinic cell\\ninjury. It is classified into acute and chronic forms both ofwhich are distinct entities.\\nAcute Pancreatitis\\nAcute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas\\npresenting clinically with ‘acute abdomen’. The severe formof the disease associated with macroscopic haemorrhagesand fat necrosis in and around the pancreas is termed acute\\nhaemorrhagic pancreatitis  or acute pancreatic necrosis.  The\\ncondition occurs in adults between the age of 40 and 70 yearsand is commoner in females than in males.\\nThe onset of acute pancreatitis is sudden, occurring after\\na bout of alcohol or a heavy meal. The patient presents withabdominal pain, vomiting and collapse and the conditionmust be differentiated from other diseases producing acuteabdomen such as acute appendicitis, perforated peptic ulcer,acute cholecystitis, and infarction of the intestine followingsudden occlusion of the mesenteric vessels. Characteri-stically, there is elevation of serum amylase  level within the\\nfirst 24 hours and elevated serum lipase  level after 3 to 4 days,\\nthe latter being more specific for pancreatic disease.Glucosuria occurs in 10% of cases.\\nETIOLOGY.  The two leading causes associated with acute\\npancreatitis are alcoholism  and cholelithiasis,  both of which\\nare implicated in more than 80% of cases. Less common\\ncauses of acute pancreatitis include trauma, ischaemia, shock,extension of inflammation from the adjacent tissues, blood-borne bacterial infection, viral infections, certain drugs (e.g.thiazides, sulfonamides, oral contraceptives), hypothermia,hyperlipoproteinaemia and hypercalcaemia from hyperpara-thyroidism. Rarely, familial pancreatitis  is encountered. In a\\nproportion of cases of acute pancreatitis, the etiology remainsunknown (idiopathic pancreatitis).\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The destructive changes in the pancreas\\nare attributed to the liberation and activation of pancreaticenzymes. Though more than 20 enzymes are secreted byexocrine pancreas, 3 main groups of enzymes which bringabout destructive effects on the pancreas are as under:1.Proteases  such as trypsin and chymotrypsin play the most\\nimportant role in causing proteolysis. Trypsin also activatesthe kinin system by converting prekallikrein to kallikrein,and thereby the clotting and complement systems areactivated. This results in inflammation, thrombosis, tissuedamage and haemorrhages found in acute haemorrhagicpancreatitis.2.Lipases and phospholipases  degrade lipids and membrane\\nphospholipids.3.Elastases  cause destruction of the elastic tissue of the blood\\nvessels.\\nThe activation and release of these enzymes is brought\\nabout by one of the following mechanisms:\\nAcinic cell damage  caused by the etiologic factors such as\\nalcohol, viruses, drugs, ischaemia and trauma result inrelease of intracellular enzymes.\\nDuct obstruction  caused by cholelithiasis, chronic\\nalcoholism and other obstructing lesions is followed byleakage of pancreatic enzymes from the ductules into theinterstitial tissue.\\nBlock in exocytosis  of pancreatic enzymes occurring from\\nnutritional causes results in activation of these intracellularenzymes by pancreatic lysosomal hydrolases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  in the early stage,\\nthe pancreas is swollen and oedematous. Subsequently,in a day or two, characteristic variegated appearance ofgrey-white pancreatic necrosis, chalky-white fat necrosisand blue-black haemorrhages are seen. In typical case, theperitoneal cavity contains blood-stained ascitic fluid andwhite flecks of fat necrosis in the omentum, mesenteryand peripancreatic tissue. The resolved lesions show areasof fibrosis, calcification and ductal dilatation.Microscopically,  the following features in varying grades\\nare noticeable:\\n1. Necrosis of pancreatic lobules and ducts.\\n2. Necrosis of the arteries and arterioles with areas of\\nhaemorrhages.\\n3. Fat necrosis.4. Inflammatory reaction, chiefly by polymorphs, around\\nthe areas of necrosis and haemorrhages.\\nCOMPLICATIONS.  A patient of acute pancreatitis who\\nsurvives may develop a variety of systemic and localcomplications.\\nSystemic complications:\\n1.Chemical and bacterial peritonitis.\\n2.Endotoxic shock.\\n3.\\nAcute renal failure.\\nLocal sequelae:1. Pancreatic abscess.2. Pancreatic pseudocyst.3. Duodenal obstruction.\\nMortality in acute pancreatitis is high (20-30%). Patients\\nsuccumb to hypotensive shock, infection, acute renal failure,\\nand DIC.\\nChronic Pancreatitis\\nChronic pancreatitis or chronic relapsing pancreatitis  is the\\nprogressive destruction of the pancreas due to repeated mild\\nand subclinical attacks of acute pancreatitis. Most patientspresent with recurrent attacks of severe abdominal pain atintervals of months to years. Weight loss and jaundice areoften associated. Later manifestations include associateddiabetes mellitus and steatorrhoea. Abdominal radiographsshow calcification in the region of pancreas and presence ofpancreatic calculi in the ducts.\\nETIOLOGY.  Most cases of chronic pancreatitis are caused\\nby the same factors as for acute pancreatitis. Thus, most\\ncommonly, chronic pancreatitis is related to chronic alcoholism\\nwith protein-rich diet, and less often to biliary tract disease.\\nFamilial hereditary pancreatitis,  though uncommon, is more\\nfrequently chronic than the acute form. Other rare causes ofchronic pancreatitis are hypercalcaemia, hyperlipidaemia647CHAPTER 21 The Liver, Biliary Tract and Exocrine Pancreasand developmental failure of fusion of dorsal and ventral\\npancreatic ducts.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis seldom\\ndevelops into chronic pancreatitis, but instead develops\\npancreatic pseudocysts following recovery. Pathogenesis ofalcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis is explainedby different mechanisms:1. Chronic pancreatitis due to chronic alcoholism accom-\\npanied by a high-protein diet results in increase in proteinconcentration in the pancreatic juice which obstructs theducts and causes damage.2.Non-alcoholic cases  of chronic pancreatitis seen in\\ntropical countries (tropical chronic pancreatitis) result from\\nprotein-calorie malnutrition. Genetic factors play a role insome cases of chronic pancreatitis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the pancreas is\\nenlarged, firm and nodular. The cut surface shows asmooth grey appearance with loss of normal lobulation.Foci of calcification and tiny pancreatic concretions tolarger visible stones are frequently found. Pseudocystsmay be present.Microscopically,  depending upon the stage of\\ndevelopment, the following changes are seen (Fig. 21.47) :\\n1.Obstruction of the ducts by fibrosis in the wall and\\nprotein plugs or stones in the lumina.2. Squamous metaplasia and dilatation of some inter-and intralobular ducts.3.Chronic inflammatory infiltrate around the lobules as\\nwell as the ducts.4.\\nAtrophy of the acinar tissue with marked increase in\\ninterlobular fibrous tissue.5. Islet tissue is involved in late stage only.COMPLICATIONS.  Late stage of chronic pancreatitis may\\nbe complicated by diabetes mellitus, pancreatic insufficiencywith steatorrhoea and malabsorption and formation ofpancreatic pseudocysts (Fig. 21.48) .\\nTUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nTumour-like masses of the exocrine pancreas include\\ncongenital cystic disease  (involving the pancreas, liver and\\nkidney) and pancreatic pseudocysts.  True pancreatic tumours\\nare classified into benign  (e.g. serous cystadenoma, fibroma,\\nlipoma and adenoma) and malignant (i.e. carcinoma of the\\npancreas). Out of all these, only two pancreatic lesions—pseudocyst and carcinoma of the pancreas, are common andare discussed below.\\nPancreatic Pseudocyst\\nPancreatic pseudocyst is a localised collection of pancreatic\\njuice, necrotic debris and haemorrhages. It developsfollowing either acute pancreatitis or trauma. The patientsgenerally present with abdominal mass producing pain,intraperitoneal haemorrhage and generalised peritonitis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the pseudocyst\\nmay be present within or adjacent to the pancreas. Usuallyit is solitary, unilocular, measuring up to 10 cm in\\ndiameter with thin or thick wall (Fig. 21.48) .\\nMicroscopically,  the cyst wall is composed of dense\\nfibrous tissue with marked inflammatory reaction. Thereis evidence of preceding haemorrhage and necrosis in theform of deposits of haemosiderin pigment, calcium andcholesterol crystals. The lumen of the cyst contains serousor turbid fluid. The cyst does not show any epitheliallining.\\nCarcinoma of Pancreas\\nPancreatic cancer is the term used for cancer of the exocrine\\npancreas. It is one of the common cancers, particularly inthe Western countries and Japan. In the United States, cancerof the pancreas is the second most common cancer of thealimentary tract after colorectal cancer, is more common inFigure 21.47 Chronic pancreatitis. There is destruction of acinar\\ntissue and presence of dystrophic calcification. The necrotic tissue is\\nsurrounded by mixed inflammatory infiltrate with granulation tissueformation.\\nFigure 21.48\\nComplications of chronic pancreatitis.\\n648SECTION III Systemic PathologyAfrican Americans and accounts for 5% of all cancer deaths\\nin that country. It is commoner in males than in females andthe incidence increases progressively after the age of 50 years.\\nETIOLOGY.   A significant increase in the incidence of\\npancreatic cancer has been observed in the UK and US during\\nthe last 50 years. Little is known about etiology of pancreaticcancer.  However, following factors have been implicated inits etiology:1.Smoking:  Heavy cigarette smokers have higher incidence\\nthan the non-smokers. However, it is not known whethertobacco metabolites have a direct carcinogenic effect on thepancreas or by some other unknown mechanism.2.Diet and obesity:  Diet with high total caloric value and\\nhigh consumption of animal proteins and fats is related tohigher incidence of pancreatic cancer. Obesity is a risk factorfor pancreatic cancer.3.Chemical carcinogens:  Individuals exposed to β-naph-\\nthylamine, benzidine and nitrosamines have higher incidenceof cancer of the pancreas.4.Diabetes mellitus:  Patients of long-standing diabetes\\nmellitus have a higher incidence.5.Chronic pancreatitis patients are at increased risk.\\n6. H. pylori infection  has been reported to have association\\nwith pancreatic cancer.7. Genetic factors  have been ound to have association with\\npancreatic cancer e.g. its occurrence in first-degree relativesin 10% cases, occurrence in certain hereditary syndromes(Lynch, FPC, HNPCC).\\nHowever, excessive consumption of alcohol or coffee, and\\ncholelithiasis are not risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Acombination of mutations in K-RAS gene and CDKN2A  gene\\nhave been found in almost all cases of cancer of the pancreas.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The most common loca-\\ntion of pancreatic cancer is the head of pancreas (70%),followed in decreasing frequency, by the body and thetail of pancreas (Fig. 21.49) .\\nGrossly,  carcinoma of the head of pancreas is generally\\nsmall, homogeneous, poorly-defined, grey-white masswithout any sharp demarcation between the tumour andthe surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. The tumour ofthe head extends into the ampulla of Vater, common bileduct and duodenum, producing obstructive biliarysymptoms and jaundice early in the course of illness.Carcinomas of the body and tail of the pancreas, on theother hand, are fairly large and irregular masses andfrequently infiltrate the transverse colon, stomach, liver,spleen and regional lymph nodes.Microscopically,  most pancreatic carcinomas arise from\\nthe ductal epithelium which normally comprises less than4% of total pancreatic cells, whereas carcinoma of the aciniFigure 21.49 Distribution of carcinoma of the pancreas (numbered\\nserially) and its major effects.\\nconstitutes less than 1% of pancreatic cancers. Thefollowing histologic patterns of pancreatic carcinoma areseen:1.Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma,  both mucinous and\\nnon-mucin secreting type, is the most common pattern.Perineural invasion is commonly present and is diagnosticof malignancy.2.Adenoacanthoma  consisting of glandular carcinoma and\\nbenign squamous elements is seen in a proportion of cases.3. Rarely, peculiar tumour giant cell formation is seen with\\nmarked anaplasia, pleomorphism and numerous mitoses.4Acinar cell carcinoma  occurs rarely and reproduces the\\npattern of acini in normal pancreas.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinical symptoms depend upon\\nthe site of origin of the tumour. Generally, the followingfeatures are present:1.Obstructive jaundice.  more often and early in the course\\nof disease in cases with carcinoma head of the pancreas (80%),and less often in cancer of the body and tail of the pancreas.It is characterised by: dark urine, clay-like stools, pruritus,and very high serum alkaline phosphatase.2.Other features.  These include: abdominal pain, anorexia,\\nweight loss, cachexia, weakness and malaise, nausea andvomiting, and migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau’ssyndrome), GI bleeding and splenomegaly.\\nThe prognosis of pancreatic cancer is dismal: median\\nsurvival is 6 months from the time of diagnosis.  Approxi-mately 10% patients survive 1 year and the 5-year survivalis poor 1 to 2%.\\n❑\\n649CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract\\nThe Kidney and\\nLower Urinary TractChapter 22Chapter 22\\nKIDNEY\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nANATOMY.  The kidneys are bean-shaped paired organs,\\neach weighing about 150 gm in the adult male and about\\n135 gm in the adult female. The hilum of the kidney issituated at the midpoint on the medial aspect where theartery, vein, lymphatics and ureter are located. The kidneyis surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule which is adherent atthe hilum.\\nCut surface of the kidney shows 3 main structures: well-\\ndemarcated peripheral cortex, inner medulla  and the innermost\\nrenal pelvis  (Fig. 22.1) :\\nThe renal cortex  forms the outer rim of the kidney and is\\nabout 1 cm in thickness.  It contains all the glomeruli andabout 85% of the nephron tubules. Remaining 15% nephronsconsisting of collecting tubules, collecting ducts, loops ofHenle and vasa recta send their loops into the medulla, andare therefore called juxtamedullary nephrons. This latter partof the cortex forms faint striations called medullary rays,  a\\nmisnomer since theses structures are located in the cortexbut are destined for medulla. Columns of renal cortical tissuethat extend into the space between adjacent pyramids arecalled the renal column (septa) of Bertin;  they contain the\\ninterlobar arteries.\\nThe renal medulla  is composed of 8-18 cone-shaped renal\\npyramids. The base of a renal pyramid lies adjacent to theouter cortex and forms the cortico-medullary junction, whilethe apex of each called the renal papilla  contains the openingof each renal pyramid for passage of urine collected fromcollecting ducts and goes down into minor calyces.\\nThe renal pelvis is the funnel-shaped collection area of\\nthe urine for drainage into the ureter. The minor calyces (8-18 in number in a normal kidney) collect urine from renalpapillae and drain into major calyces (2-3 in a normal kidney).\\nHISTOLOGY.  The parenchyma of each kidney is composed\\nof approximately one million microstructures called\\nnephrons. A nephron, in turn, consists of 5 major parts, eachhaving a functional role in the formation of urine: theglomerular capsule (glomerulus and Bowman’s capsule), theproximal convoluted tubule (PCT), the loop of Henle, thedistal convoluted tubule (DCT), and the collecting ducts.From point of view of diseases of the kidneys, 4 componentsof renal parenchyma require further elaboration: renalvasculature, glomeruli, tubules and interstitium.\\n1.Renal vasculature.  Each kidney is supplied with blood\\nby a main renal artery  which arises from the aorta at the level\\nof the 2nd lumbar vertebra. It usually divides into anterior\\nand posterior divisions  at the hilum although occasionally these\\ndivisions may even arise directly from the aorta. The anterior\\nand posterior divisions divide into segmental branches  from\\nwhich interlobar arteries  arise which course between the lobes.\\nAlong their course, they give off the arcuate arteries  which\\narch between the cortex and medulla. The arcuate arteries,in turn, give off interlobular arteries  which lie in the cortex\\nperpendicular to the capsular surface in the part overlyingthe pyramids and, therefore, are also called straight arteries\\n(Fig. 22.2) . It is from the interlobular arteries that the afferent\\nFigure 22.1 Cross-section of the kidney showing gross structures.Figure 22.2 Cross-section of the kidney showing arterial blood\\nsupply.\\n650SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\narterioles take their origin, each one supplying a single\\nglomerulus. From the glomerulus emerge the efferent\\narterioles . Up to this stage, the arteries and arterioles are end-\\nvessels. The efferent arterioles leaving the glomerulus supply\\nperitubular capillary plexus  which anastomoses with the\\ncapillary plexus of another nephron.\\nThe juxtamedullary glomeruli, however, give off a series\\nof parallel vessels called vasa recta which descend to the inner\\nmedulla supplying the loop of Henle and collecting ductsand anastomose at all levels throughout the medulla withthe ascending vasa recta. These drain into arcuate veins  and\\nthen into the veins that accompany the corresponding arteriesand finally through a single renal vein into the inferior venacava (Fig. 22.3) . Lymphatic drainage likewise occurs through\\nlymphatics associated with the intrarenal vasculature leavingthe kidney at the hilum and draining to lateral aortic lymphnodes.\\nThe following important inferences can be drawn from\\nthe peculiarities of the renal vasculature:\\ni)The renal cortex receives about 90% of the total renal\\nblood supply and that the pressure in the glomerularcapillaries is high. Therefore, renal cortex is more prone to\\nthe effects of hypertension.\\nii)The renal medulla, on the other hand, is poorly perfused\\nand any interference in blood supply to it results in medullary\\nnecrosis.\\niii)\\nThe divisions and subdivisions of the renal artery up to\\narterioles are end-arteries and have no anastomoses. Thus,\\nocclusion of any of the branches results in infarction of therenal parenchyma supplied by it.\\niv) Since the tubular capillary beds are derived from the\\nefferent arterioles leaving the glomeruli, diseases affectingthe blood flow through glomerular tuft have significanteffects on the tubules as well.\\n2. Glomerulus.  The glomerulus consists of invagination of\\nthe blind end of the proximal tubule and contains a capillary\\ntuft fed by the afferent arteriole and drained by efferent\\narteriole. The capillary tuft is covered by visceral epithelial\\ncells (podocytes) which are continuous with those of theparietal epithelium at the vascular pole.  The transition to\\nproximal tubular cells occurs at the urinary pole of the\\nglomerulus. The visceral and parietal epithelial cells areseparated by the urinary space or Bowman’s space,  into which\\nglomerular filtrate passes (Fig. 22.4) .\\nSubdivisions of capillaries derived from the afferent\\narterioles result in the formation of lobules  (up to 8 in number)\\nwithin a glomerulus. Each lobule of a glomerular tuft consistsof a centrilobular supporting stalk composed of mesangiumcontaining mesangial cells and  mesangial matrix. The\\nmesangium is continuous at the hilum with the lacis cells  of\\nthe juxtaglomerular apparatus. Besides their role assupportive cells, mesangial cells are involved in theproduction of mesangial matrix and glomerular basementmembrane; they function in endocytosis of leaked macro-molecules and also possibly in the control of glomerularblood flow through contractile elements present in these cells.\\nThe major function  of glomerulus is complex filtration\\nfrom the capillaries to the urinary space. Glomerular filtrateis quite similar in composition to plasma but lacks proteinsand cells. Normally, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is about125 ml/minute. The barrier to glomerular filtration consistsof the following 3 components  (Fig. 22.5) :\\ni)Fenestrated endothelial cells lining the capillary loops.\\nii)Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) on which the\\nendothelial cells rest. It further consists of 3 layers—thecentral lamina densa, bounded by lamina rara interna onendothelial side of the capillary and lamina rara externa onvisceral epithelial side of the capillary.iii)Filtration slit pores between the foot processes of the\\nvisceral epithelial cells (podocytes) external to GBM.\\nThe barrier to filtration of macromolecules of the size and\\nmolecular weight of albumin and larger depends upon thefollowing:\\nA normal lamina densa.\\nMaintenance of negative charge on both lamina rarae.\\nA healthy covering of glomerular epithelial cells.\\nJuxtaglomerular apparatus.  The juxtaglomerular apparatus\\n(JGA) is situated at the vascular pole of the glomerulus andis made up of 3 parts (Fig. 22.4) :Figure 22.3 A schematic illustration of the structure of a nephron\\n(in longitudinal section) and associated blood supply.\\n651CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tracti) The juxtaglomerular cells  are modified granular smooth\\nmuscle cells in the media of the afferent arteriole and contain\\nthe hormone, renin.\\nii) The macula densa  is comprised by specialised region of\\nthe distal tubule when it returns to the vascular pole of its\\nparent glomerulus. The tubular cells here are taller andnarrower than elsewhere with the nuclei lying close together.\\niii)The lacis cells  or non-granular cells occupy the space\\nbetween the macula densa and the arterioles and merge with\\nthe glomerular mesangium.\\nThe JGA is intimately concerned with sodium metabolism\\nand is the principal source of renin production. Themechanism of the release of renin and its role in hypertensionare discussed on page 686.\\n3. Tubules.  The tubules of the kidney account for the\\ngreatest amount of the renal parenchyma. The structure of\\nrenal tubular epithelium varies in different parts of thenephron and is correlated with the functional capacity of thatpart of the tubule ( see Fig. 22.3).\\ni) Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT).  This is the first part\\narising from the glomerulus and is highly specialised partfunctionally. It is lined by cuboidal cells with a brush bordercomposed of microvilli and contains numerousmitochondria, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.The major functions of PCT are: active reabsorption  of filtered\\nsodium, potassium, glucose, amino acids, proteins, vitamins,bicarbonate, phosphate, calcium and uric acid, and passive\\nreabsorption  of 80% of filtered water.\\nii) Loop of Henle.  The PCT drains into the straight part of\\nloop of Henle that consists of thin descending, and thin andthick ascending limbs, both of which have different structureand function. The descending limb is continuation of PCT,while ascending limb continues further into distal convolutedtubule (DCT). The descending segment of loop is lined bysimple epithelium while the ascending limb is lined bycolumnar cells. The major function of loop of Henle is active\\nreabsorption  of sodium, potassium and chloride, and passive\\ndiffusion  of water resulting in concentrated filtrate of urine.\\niii)Distal convoluted tubule (DCT).  The DCT represents a\\ntransition from thick ascending limb from the point wherethe ascending limb meets the vascular pole of the glomerulusof its origin, to the early collecting ducts. The lining cells inFigure 22.4 Structure of a nephron.\\nFigure 22.5 Ultrastructure of glomerular filtration barrier.\\n652SECTION III Systemic PathologyDCT are cuboidal. The epithelial cells at the point of\\nbeginning of DCT are taller, narrower and more closelypacked to form the macula densa of JGA as already described.The DCT further contributes to urinary concentration andacidification, while the macula densa of JGA is the source ofrenin and has a role in sodium metabolism.\\niv) Collecting ducts. The system of collecting ducts is the final\\npathway by which urine reaches the tip of renal papilla. Thecells lining the collecting ducts are cuboidal but lack the brushborder. Collecting ducts reabsorb water under control ofADH, and secrete H\\n+ and K+ ions.\\n4. Interstitium.  In health, the renal cortical interstitium is\\nscanty and consists of a small number of fibroblast-like cells.But the medullary interstitium is more plentiful and containsstellate interstitial cells which are considered to produce ananti-hypertensive agent and are involved in the metabolismof prostaglandins.\\nRENAL FUNCTION  TESTS\\nIn general, the kidney performs the following vital functions\\nin the body:\\n1.Excretion of waste products  resulting from protein\\nmetabolism.2.Regulation of acid-base balance  by excretion of H\\n+ ions\\n(acidification) and bicarbonate ions.\\n3.Regulation of salt-water balance  by hormones secreted both\\nintra- and extra-renally.\\n4.Formation of renin and erythropoietin  and thereby playing\\na role in the regulation of blood pressure and erythropoiesis\\nrespectively.\\nIn order to assess renal function, a number of tests have\\nbeen devised which give information regarding the followingparameters:a) Renal blood flowb) Glomerular filtrationc) Renal tubular functiond) Urinary outflow unhindered by any obstruction.\\nRenal function tests are broadly divided into 4 groups\\n(Table 22.1):\\n1.

The simplest diagnostic tests for\\nrenal function is the physical, chemical, bacteriologic and\\nmicroscopic examination of the urine.\\ni)The physical examination  includes 24-hour urinary output,\\ncolour, specific gravity and osmolality. Normally urine is\\nclear, pale or straw-coloured due to pigment urochrome and700-2500 ml (average 1200 ml) of urine is passed in 24 hours,mostly during day time. Specific gravity is used to measurethe concentrating and diluting power of the kidneys.\\nii) T h\\ne chemical tests  are carried out to detect the presence of\\nprotein, glucose, red cells and haemoglobin to assess the\\npermeability of glomerular membrane. A number ofconvenient dipstick tests are available for testing thesechemical substances and pH. These consist of paper stripsimpregnated with appropriate reagents and indicator dyes.\\nii) The bacteriologic examination  of the urine is done by proper\\nand aseptic collection of midstream specimen of urine.\\niv)Urine microscopy is undertaken on a fresh unstained\\nsample. Various components observed on microscopic\\nexamination of the urine in renal disease are red cells, puscells, epithelial cells, crystals and urinary casts. The casts aremoulded into cylindrical shapes by passage along tubulesin which they are formed. They are the result of precipitationof proteins in the tubule that includes not only albumin butalso the tubular secretion of the Tamm Horsfall protein . The\\nlatter is a high molecular weight glycoprotein normallysecreted by ascending loop of Henle and DCT and probablyhas body defense function normally. Its secretion is increasedin glomerular and tubular diseases. Casts may be hyaline type\\nconsisting of only proteins indicating a non-inflammatoryetiology of glomerular filtration of proteins, leucocyte casts\\ninflammatory in origin, or red cell casts  from haematuria.\\n2. CONCENTRATION AND DILUTION TESTS.  Concen-\\ntration and dilution tests are designed to evaluate functionalcapacity of the renal tubules. The ability of the nephron toconcentrate or dilute urine is dependent upon both functionalactivity of the tubular cells in the renal medulla and the\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.1: Renal Function Tests.\\n1.

Failure to achieve\\nadequate urinary concentration can be due to either defectswithin the renal medulla (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus),  or\\ndue to the lack of ADH (central diabetes insipidus).\\nTraditionally, urinary concentration is determined by\\nspecific gravity of the urine (normal range 1.003 to 1.030,average 1.018) which in cases of tubular disease remainsconstant at approximately 1.010 regardless of changing levelsof plasma hydration. However, determination of urinaryspecific gravity provides only a rough estimate of osmolarityof the urine. The tubular disease can be diagnosed in its earlystage by water deprivation (concentration) or water excess\\n(dilution) tests.\\ni) In concentration test,  an artificial fluid deprivation is\\ninduced in the patient for more than 20 hours. If the nephron\\nis normal, water is selectively reabsorbed resulting inexcretion of urine of high solute concentration (specificgravity of 1.025 or more). However, if the tubular cells arenonfunctional, the solute concentration of the urine willremain constant regardless of stress of water deprivation.\\nii) In dilution test,  an excess of fluid is given to the patient.\\nNormally, renal compensation should result in excretion of\\nurine with high water content and lower solute concentration(specific gravity of 1.003 or less). If the renal tubules arediseased, the concentration of solutes in the urine will remainconstant irrespective of the excess water intake.\\n3. BLOOD  CHEMISTRY.  Impairment of renal function\\nresults in elevation of end-products of protein metabolism.\\nThis includes increased accumulation of certain substancesin the blood, chiefly urea (normal range 20-40 mg/dl), bloodurea nitrogen (BUN) (normal range 10-20 mg/dl) andcreatinine (normal range 0.6-1.2 mg/dl). An increase of theseend-products in the blood is called azotaemia.\\nHigh levels of creatinine are associated with high levels\\nof β2-microglobulin  in the serum as well as urine, a low-\\nmolecular weight protein filtered excessively in the urine dueto glomerular disease or due to increased production by theliver.\\n4. RENAL CLEARANCE TESTS.  A clearance test is\\nemployed to assess the rate of glomerular filtration and the\\nrenal blood flow. The rate of this filtration can be measuredby determining the excretion rate of a substance which isfiltered through the glomerulus but subsequently is neitherreabsorbed nor secreted by the tubules. The glomerularfiltration rate (normal 120 ml/minute in an average adult) isusually equal to clearance of that substance and is calculatedfrom the following equation:\\nUV\\nC =\\n  _______ where\\nP\\nCis the clearance of the substance in ml/ minute;\\nUis the concentration of the substance in the urine;\\nVis the volume of urine passed per minute; and\\nPis the concentration of the substance in the plasma.The substances which are used for clearance tests include\\ninulin, mannitol, creatinine and urea.\\ni) In  inulin or mannitol clearance tests,  an intravenous\\ninfusion of the substance inulin or mannitol is given tomaintain constant plasma concentration and accurately timed\\nurine samples are collected. Inulin, a mixture of fructosepolymers, is considered the ideal substance for the clearancetest since it is filtered from the glomerulus and is excretedunchanged in the urine.\\nii) In  creatinine clearance test,  there is no need of intra-\\nvenous infusion of creatinine since creatinine is normally\\nreleased into plasma by muscle metabolism and a very smallfraction of this substance is secreted by the tubules. Theclearance of creatinine is determined by collecting urine over24-hour period and a blood sample is withdrawn during theday. In spite of disadvantages like poor reproducibility andsecretion of creatinine by the tubules, the ‘endogenous’creatinine clearance test is easy and routinely employedmethod of estimating GFR.\\niii) In  urea clearance test,  the sensitivity is much less than\\nthe creatinine or inulin clearance because plasma\\nconcentration of urea is affected by a number of factors (e.g.dietary protein, fluid intake, infection, trauma, surgery, andcorticosteroids) and is partly reabsorbed by the tubules. Likein creatinine clearance, there is no need for intravenousinfusion of urea.\\niv)Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance test  is\\nemployed to measure renal blood flow (unlike the preceding\\ntests which measure GFR). PAH when infused intravenouslyis both filtered at the glomerulus as well as secreted by thetubules and its clearance is measured by determining itsconcentration in arterial blood and urine. Normally, renalblood flow is about 1200 ml per minute in an average adult.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF RENAL DISEASE :\\nRENAL FAILURE\\nTraditionally, diseases of the kidneys are divided into 4 major\\ngroups according to the predominant involvement ofcorresponding morphologic components:\\n1.Glomerular diseases:  These are most often immuno-\\nlogically-mediated and may be acute or chronic.2.Tubular diseases:  These are more likely to be caused by\\ntoxic or infectious agents and are often acute.\\n3.Interstitial diseases:  These are likewise commonly due to\\ntoxic or infectious agents and quite often involve interstitium\\nas well as tubules (tubulo-interstitial diseases).\\n4.Vascular diseases:  These include changes in the nephron\\nas a consequence of increased intra-glomerular pressure such\\nas in hypertension or impaired blood flow.\\nIn addition, other diseases described in this chapter\\ninclude: congenital anomalies, obstructive uropathy(including urolithiasis) and tumours of the kidneys.\\nThe major morphologic involvements of the kidneys in\\nthe initial stage is confined to one component (glomeruli,tubules, interstitium or blood vessels), but eventually allcomponents are affected leading to end-stage kidneys.\\nRegardless of cause, renal disease usually results in the\\nevolution of one of the two major pathological syndromes:acute renal failure  and chronic renal failure.  The term ‘azotaemia’\\nis used for biochemical abnormality characterised byelevation of the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatininelevels, while ‘uraemia’  is defined as association of these654SECTION III Systemic Pathologybiochemical abnormalities with clinical signs and symptoms.\\nThe pathophysiological aspects of acute and chronic renalfailure are briefly discussed below.\\nAcute Renal Failure (ARF)\\nAcute renal failure (ARF) is a syndrome characterised by\\nrapid onset of renal dysfunction, chiefly oliguria or anuria,and sudden increase in metabolic waste-products (urea andcreatinine) in the blood with consequent development ofuraemia.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The causes of ARF may be classified\\nas pre-renal, intra-renal and post-renal in nature.\\n1. Pre-renal causes.  Pre-renal diseases are those which cause\\nsudden decrease in blood flow to the nephron. Renal\\nischaemia ultimately results in functional disorders ordepression of GFR, or both. These causes include inadequatecardiac output and hypovolaemia or vascular disease causingreduced perfusion of the kidneys.\\n2.\\nIntra-renal  causes.  Intra-renal disease is characterised by\\ndisease of renal tissue itself. These include vascular disease\\nof the arteries and arterioles within the kidney, diseases ofglomeruli, acute tubular necrosis due to ischaemia, or theeffect of a nephrotoxin, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis andpyelonephritis.\\n3. Post-renal causes.  Post-renal disease is characteristically\\ncaused by obstruction to the flow of urine anywhere along\\nthe renal tract distal to the opening of the collecting ducts.This may be caused by a mass within the lumen or from wallof the tract, or from external compression anywhere alongthe lower urinary tract—ureter, bladder neck or urethra.\\nIt is important to note that ARF originating in pre- and\\npost-renal disease, such as by renal ischaemia or renalinfection, eventually leads to intra-renal disease. Thus, full-blown ARF reflects some degree of nephron damage.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical features will depend\\nto a large extent on the underlying cause of ARF and on the\\nstage of the disease at which the patient presents. However,one of the following three major patterns usually emerge:\\n1.Syndrome of acute nephritis.  This is most frequently\\nassociated with acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis\\nand rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Renaldysfunction results from extensive proliferation of epithelialcells in the glomeruli with consequent mild increase inglomerular permeability and decrease in GFR. Thecharacteristic features are: mild proteinuria, haematuria,oedema and mild hypertension. Fluid retention in acutenephritis syndrome appears to be due to both diminishedGFR and increased salt and water reabsorption in distalnephron.\\n2. Syndrome accompanying tubular pathology.  When the\\nARF is caused by destruction of the tubular cells of the\\nnephron as occurs in acute tubular necrosis (page 679), thedisease typically progresses through 3 characteristic stagesfrom oliguria to diuresis to recovery.\\ni)Oliguric phase:  The initial oliguric phase lasting on an\\naverage from 7 to 10 days is characterised by urinary outputof less than 400 ml per day. The decline in formation of the\\nurine leads to accumulation of waste products of proteinmetabolism in the blood and resultant azotaemia, metabolicacidosis, hyperkalaemia, hypernatraemia and hypervolaemiadue to secondary effects of circulatory overload andpulmonary oedema. The specific gravity of the urine is lowbut the concentration of sodium in urine tends to be elevated.\\nii)Diuretic phase:  With the onset of healing of tubules, there\\nis improvement in urinary output. This is believed to occur\\ndue to drawing of water and sodium by preceding high levelsof creatinine and urea as they move through the nephron soas to be excreted. Since tubular cells have not regained normalfunctional capacity, the urine is of low or fixed specificgravity.\\niii)Phase of recovery:  Full recovery with healing of tubular\\nepithelial cells occurs in about half the cases, while others\\nterminate in death. The process of healing may take up toone year with restoration of normal tubular function.\\n3.Pre-renal syndrome.  The ARF occurring secondary to\\ndisorders in which neither the glomerulus nor the tubules\\nare damaged, results in pre-renal syndrome. Typically, thispattern is seen in marginal ischaemia caused by renal arterialobstruction, hypovolaemia, hypotension or cardiacinsufficiency. Due to depressed renal blood flow, there isdecrease in GFR causing oliguria, azotaemia (elevation ofBUN and creatinine) and possible fluid retention andoedema. Since the tubular cells are functioning normally, thenephron retains its ability to concentrate the glomerularfiltrate according to the adaptive needs.\\nChronic Renal Failure (CRF)\\nChronic renal failure is a syndrome characterised by\\nprogressive and irreversible deterioration of renal functiondue to slow destruction of renal parenchyma, eventuallyterminating in death when sufficient number of nephronshave been damaged. Acidosis is the major problem in CRFwith development of biochemical azotaemia and clinicaluraemia syndrome.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  All chronic nephropathies can lead\\nto CRF. The diseases leading to CRF can generally be\\nclassified into two major groups: those causing glomerular\\npathology, and those causing tubulointerstitial pathology.  Though\\nthis classification is useful to facilitate study, the diseaserarely remains confined to either glomeruli or tubulo-interstitial tissue alone. In the final stage of CRF, all parts ofthe nephron are involved.\\n1.Diseases causing glomerular pathology.  A number of\\nglomerular diseases associated with CRF have their patho-\\ngenesis in immune mechanisms (page 662). Glomerulardestruction results in changes in filtration process and leadsto development of the nephrotic syndrome characterised byproteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and oedema. The importantexamples of chronic glomerular diseases causing CRF arecovered under two headings: primary and systemic.\\ni)Primary glomerular pathology:  The major cause of CRF is\\nchronic glomerulonephritis, usually initiated by various\\ntypes of glomerulonephritis such as membranous glomerulo-655CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tractnephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, lipoid\\nnephrosis (minimal change disease) and anti-glomerularbasement membrane nephritis.\\nii)Systemic glomerular pathology:  Certain conditions originate\\noutside the renal system but induce changes in the nephrons\\nsecondarily. Major examples of this type are systemic lupuserythematosus, serum sickness nephritis and diabeticnephropathy.\\n2. Diseases causing tubulointerstitial pathology.  Damage\\nto tubulointerstitial tissues results in alterations in\\nreabsorption and secretion of important constituents leadingto excretion of large volumes of dilute urine. Tubulointer-stitial diseases can be categorised according to initiatingetiology into 4 groups: vascular, infectious, toxic andobstructive.\\ni)Vascular causes:  Long-standing primary or essential\\nhypertension produces characteristic changes in renal arteries\\nand arterioles referred to as nephrosclerosis (page 687).Nephrosclerosis causes progressive renal vascular occlusionterminating in ischaemia and necrosis of renal tissue.\\nii)Infectious causes:  A good example of chronic renal infec-\\ntion causing CRF is chronic pyelonephritis. The chronicity\\nof process results in progressive damage to increasingnumber of nephrons leading to CRF.\\niii)Toxic causes:  Some toxic substances induce slow tubular\\ninjury, eventually culminating in CRF. The most common\\nexample is intake of high doses of analgesics such asphenacetin, aspirin and acetaminophen (chronic analgesicnephritis). Other substances that can cause CRF after\\nprolonged exposure are lead, cadmium and uranium.\\niv)Obstructive causes:  Chronic obstruction in the urinary tract\\nleads to progressive damage to the nephron due to fluid back-\\npressure. The examples of this type of chronic injury arestones, blood clots, tumours, strictures and enlarged prostate.\\nRegardless of the initiating cause, CRF evolves\\nprogressively through 4 stages:\\n1. Decreased renal reserve.  At this stage, damage to renal\\nparenchyma is marginal and the kidneys remain functional.\\nThe GFR is about 50% of normal, BUN and creatinine valuesare normal and the patients are usually asymptomatic exceptat times of stress.\\n2. Renal  insufficiency.  At this stage, about 75% of\\nfunctional renal parenchyma has been destroyed. The GFR\\nis about 25% of normal accompanied by elevation in BUNand serum creatinine. Polyuria and nocturia occur due totubulointerstitial damage. Sudden stress may precipitateuraemic syndrome.\\n3. Renal failure.  At this stage, about 90% of functional renal\\ntissue has been destroyed. The GFR is approximately 10% of\\nnormal. Tubular cells are essentially nonfunctional. As aresult, the regulation of sodium and water is lost resultingin oedema, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcaemia, and signs andsymptoms of uraemia.\\n4. End-stage kidney.  The GFR at this stage is less than 5%\\nof normal and results in complex clinical picture of uraemic\\nsyndrome with progressive primary (renal) and secondarysystemic (extra-renal) symptoms.CLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinical manifestations of full-\\nblown CRF culminating in uraemic syndrome are described\\nunder 2 main headings: primary (renal) uraemic manifes-tations and secondary (systemic or extra-renal) uraemicmanifestations.\\nA. Primary uraemic (renal) manifestations. Primary\\nsymptoms of uraemia develop when there is slow and\\nprogressive deterioration of renal function. The resultingimbalances cause the following manifestations:\\n1.\\nMetabolic acidosis.  As a result of renal dysfunction, acid-\\nbase balance is progressively lost. Excess of hydrogen ions\\noccurs, while bicarbonate level declines in the blood, resulting\\nin metabolic acidosis. The clinical symptoms of metabolic\\nacidosis include: compensatory Kussmaul breathing,hyperkalaemia and hypercalcaemia.\\n2. Hyperkalaemia.  A decreased GFR results in excessive\\naccumulation of potassium in the blood since potassium is\\nnormally excreted mainly in the urine. Hyperkalaemia isfurther worsened by metabolic acidosis. The clinical featuresof hyperkalaemia are: cardiac arrhythmias, weakness,nausea, intestinal colic, diarrhoea, muscular irritability and\\nflaccid paralysis.\\n3. Sodium and water imbalance.  As GFR declines, sodium\\nand water cannot pass sufficiently into Bowman’s capsule\\nleading to their retention. Release of renin from\\njuxtaglomerular apparatus further aggravates sodium andwater retention. The main symptoms referable to sodium andwater retention are: hypervolaemia and circulatory overloadwith congestive heart failure.\\n4. Hyperuricaemia.  Decreased GFR results in excessive\\naccumulation of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid crystals may\\nbe deposited in joints and soft tissues resulting in gout.\\n5. Azotaemia.  The waste-products of protein metabolism\\nfail to be excreted resulting in elevation in the blood levels\\nof urea, creatinine, phenols and guanidines causingbiochemical abnormality, azotaemia. The secondary\\nmanifestations of uraemia are related to toxic effects of these\\nmetabolic waste-products.\\nB. Secondary uraemic (extra-renal) manifestations.  A\\nnumber of extra-renal systemic manifestations develop\\nsecondarily following fluid-electrolyte and acid-baseimbalances. These include the following:\\n1. Anaemia.  Decreased production of erythropoietin by\\ndiseased kidney results in decline in erythropoiesis and\\nanaemia. Besides, gastrointestinal bleeding may furtheraggravate anaemia.\\n2. Integumentary system.  Deposit of urinary pigment such\\nas urochrome in the skin causes sallow-yellow colour. The\\nurea content in the sweat as well as in the plasma rises. Onevaporation of the perspiration, urea remains on the facial\\nskin as powdery ‘uraemic frost’.\\n3. Cardiovascular system.  Fluid retention secondarily\\ncauses cardiovascular symptoms such as increased workload\\non the heart due to the hypervolaemia and eventuallycongestive heart failure.\\n4. Respiratory system.  Hypervolaemia and heart failure\\ncause pulmonary congestion and pulmonary oedema due656SECTION III Systemic Pathologyto back pressure. Radiologically, uraemic pneumonitis shows\\ncharacteristic central, butterfly-pattern of oedema andcongestion in the chest radiograph.\\n5. Digestive system.  Azotaemia directly induces mucosal\\nulcerations in the lining of the stomach and intestines.\\nSubsequent bleeding can aggravate the existing anaemia.Gastrointestinal irritation may cause nausea, vomiting anddiarrhoea.\\n6. Skeletal system.  The skeletal manifestations of renal\\nfailure are referred to as renal osteodystrophy  (Chapter 28).\\nTwo major types of skeletal disorders may occur:\\ni)Osteomalacia  occurs from deficiency of a form of vitamin\\nD which is normally activated by the kidney (page 248). Since\\nvitamin D is essential for absorption of calcium, its deficiencyresults in inadequate deposits of calcium in bone tissue.\\nii)Osteitis fibrosa  occurs due to elevated levels of\\nparathormone. How parathormone excess develops in CRF\\nis complex. As the GFR is decreased, increasing levels ofphosphates accumulate in the extracellular fluid which, inturn, cause decline in calcium levels. Decreased calcium leveltriggers the secretion of parathormone which mobilisescalcium from bone and increases renal tubular reabsorptionof calcium thereby conserving it. However, if the process ofresorption of calcium phosphate from bone continues forsufficient time, hypercalcaemia may be induced withdeposits of excess calcium salts in joints and soft tissues andweakening of bones (renal osteodystrophy).\\nCONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS\\nApproximately 10% of all persons are born with potentially\\nsignificant malformations of the urinary system. These rangein severity from minor anomalies which may not produceclinical manifestations to major anomalies which areincompatible with extrauterine life. About half of all patientswith malformations of the kidneys have coexistent anomalieseither elsewhere in the urinary tract or in other organs.\\nMalformations of the kidneys are classified into 3 broad\\ngroups:\\nI. Abnormalities in amount of renal  tissue.  These include:\\nanomalies with deficient renal parenchyma (e.g. unilateral\\nor bilateral renal hypoplasia) or with excess renal tissue (e.g.renomegaly, supernumerary kidneys).\\nII. Anomalies of position, form and orientation.  These are:\\nrenal ectopia (pelvic kidney), renal fusion (horseshoe kidney)\\nand persistent foetal lobation.\\nIII. Anomalies of differentiation.  This group consists of the\\nmore important and common morphologic forms covered\\nunder the heading of ‘cystic diseases of the kidney’  described\\nin detail below.\\nCYSTIC DISEASES OF KIDNEY\\nCystic lesions of the kidney may be congenital or acquired,\\nnon-neoplastic or neoplastic.  Majority of these lesions are\\ncongenital non-neoplastic. Cystic lesions in the kidney may\\noccur at any age, extending from foetal life (detected onultrasonography) to old age. Their clinical presentation mayinclude: abdominal mass, infection, respiratory distress (dueto accompanied pulmonary hypoplasia), haemorrhage, andneoplastic transformation.\\nPotter divided developmental renal cystic lesions into\\nthree types—I, II and III. A simple classification includingall cystic lesions of the kidney is given in Table 22.2  and\\nFig. 22.6 .

Multicystic Renal Dysplasia\\nThe term ‘multicystic renal dysplasia’ or Potter type II is used\\nfor disorganised metanephrogenic differentiation withpersistence of structures in the kidney which are notrepresented in normal nephrogenesis.  Renal dysplasia is themost common form of cystic renal disease in the newbornand infants. The condition may occur sporadically or maybefamilial and part of a syndrome of other anomalies. It iscommonly associated with obstructive abnormalities of theureter and lower urinary tract such as obstruction ofpelviureteric junction (PUJ), ureteral atresia and urethralobstruction.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Renal dysplasia may be\\nunilateral or bilateral. The dysplastic process may involvethe entire renal mass or a part of it.Grossly,  the dysplastic kidney is almost always cystic. The\\nkidney or its affected part is replaced by disorderly massof multiple cysts resembling a bunch of grapes. Normalrenal parenchyma is almost totally obscured by the masswhile calyces and pelvis may not be recognised. The ureteris invariably abnormal, being either absent or atretic.Histologically,  the characteristic feature is the presence\\nof undifferentiated mesenchyme that contains smoothmuscle, cartilage and immature collecting ducts. The cystsin the mass represent dilated tubules lined by flattenedepithelium which are surrounded by concentric layers ofconnective tissue (Fig. 22.7) . Glomeruli and tubules are\\nscanty, primitive or absent.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES. Unilateral renal dysplasia is\\nfrequently discovered in newborn or infants as a flank mass.Often, renal dysplasia is associated with other congenitalmalformations and syndromes such as ventricular septaldefect, tracheo-esophageal fistula, lumbosacralmeningomyelocele and Down’s syndrome.\\nThe prognosis of unilateral renal dysplasia following\\nremoval of the abnormal kidney is excellent while bilateralrenal dysplasia results in death in infancy unless renaltransplant is done.\\nII. Polycystic Kidney Disease\\nPolycystic disease of the kidney (PKD) is a disorder in which\\nmajor portion of the renal parenchyma is converted into cystsof varying size. The disease occurs in two forms:\\nA.An adult type  inherited as an autosomal dominant  disease;\\nand\\nB. An infantile type  inherited as an autosomal recessive\\ndisorder.\\nA.\\nADULT POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE\\nAdult (autosomal dominant) polycystic kidney disease\\n(ADPKD) is relatively common (incidence 1:400 to 1: 1:1000)and is the cause of end-stage renal failure in approximately4% of haemodialysis patients. The pattern of inheritance isautosomal dominant with mutation in PKD gene: mutation in\\nPKD-1 gene located on chromosome 16 in over 85% cases\\n(ADPKD-1) while remainder 15% cases have mutation inPKD-2  gene located on chromosome 4 (ADPKD-2). Family\\nhistory of similar renal disease may be present. The true adultpolycystic renal disease is always bilateral and diffuse.Though the kidneys are abnormal at birth, renal function isretained, and symptoms appear in adult life, mostly betweenthe age of 30 and 50 years.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  kidneys in\\nADPKD are always bilaterally enlarged, usually symme-trically, heavy (weighing up to 4 kg) and give it a lobulatedappearance on external surface due to underlying cysts .The cut surface shows cysts throughout the renalparenchyma varying in size from tiny cysts to 4-5 cm indiameter (Fig. 22.8,A) . The contents of the cysts vary from\\nclear straw-yellow fluid to reddish-brown material. Therenal pelvis and calyces are present but are greatlydistorted by the cysts and may contain concretions(Fig. 22.9) . The cysts, however, do not communicate with\\nthe pelvis of the kidney—a feature that helps to distinguishpolycystic kidney from hydronephrosis of the kidney onsectioned surface (page 692).\\nHistologically,  the cysts arise from all parts of nephron.\\nIt is possible to find some cysts containing recognisable\\nglomerular tufts reflecting their origin from Bowman’scapsule, while others have epithelial lining like that ofdistal or proximal tubules or collecting ducts. Theintervening tissue between the cysts shows some normalrenal parenchyma. With advancement of age of thepatient, acquired lesions such as pyelonephritis,nephrosclerosis, fibrosis and chronic inflammation areseen with increasingly frequency.Figure 22.7 Renal cystic dysplasia. There are cyst s lined by flattened\\nepithelium while the intervening parenchyma consists of primitive\\nconnective tissue and cartilage.\\n658SECTION III Systemic PathologyCLINICAL FEATURES.  The condition may become\\nclinically apparent at any age but most commonly manifests\\nin 3rd to 5th decades of life. The most frequent and earliestpresenting feature is a dull-ache in the lumbar regions. Inothers, the presenting complaints are haematuria or passageof blood clots in urine, renal colic, hypertension, urinary tractinfections and progressive CRF with polyuria andproteinuria.\\nADPKD is considered a systemic disease. About a third\\nof patients with ADPKD have cysts of the liver (Chapter 21).Other associated congenital anomalies seen less frequentlyare cysts in the pancreas, spleen, lungs and other organs.Approximately 15% of patients have one or more intracranialberry aneurysms of the circle of Willis. Any acquired renaldisease is more prone to occur in polycystic kidneys.\\nB. INFANTILE POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE\\nThe infantile (autosomal recessive) form of polycystic kidney\\ndisease (ARPKD) is distinct from the adult form and is lesscommon (incidence 1:20,000 births). It is transmitted as anautosomal recessive  trait and the family history of similar\\ndisease is usually not present. The condition occurs due to amutation in chromosome 6— 6p21, PKHD1  (polycystic kidney\\nand hepatic disease 1). It is invariably bilateral. The age atpresentation may be perinatal, neonatal, infantile or juvenile,but frequently serious manifestations are present at birth andresult in death from renal failure in early childhood.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the kidneys are\\nbilaterally enlarged with smooth external surface andretained normal reniform shape. Cut surface reveals small,fusiform or cylindrical cysts radiating from the medullaand extend radially to the outer cortex. This gives thesectioned surface of the kidney sponge-like appearance(Fig. 22.8,B) . No normal renal parenchyma is grossly\\nrecognised. Pelvis, calyces and ureters are normal.\\nHistologically,  the total number of nephrons is normal.\\nSince the cysts are formed from dilatation of collecting\\ntubules, all the collecting tubules show cylindrical orsaccular dilatations and are lined by cuboidal to lowcolumnar epithelium. Many of the glomeruli are alsocystically dilated.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations depend\\non age of the child. In severe form, the gross bilateral cysticrenal enlargement may interfere with delivery. In infancy,renal failure may manifest early. Almost all cases of infantilepolycystic kidney disease have associated multipleepithelium-lined cysts in the liver or proliferation of portalbile ductules. In older children, associated hepatic changesevelop into what is termed congenital hepatic fibrosis  which\\nmay lead to portal hypertension and splenomegaly.\\nThe contrasting features of the two main forms of the\\npolycystic kidney disease are presented in Table 22.3.\\nIII.Medullary Cystic Disease\\nCystic disease of the renal medulla has two main types:\\nA.Medullary sponge kidney,  a relatively common and\\ninnocuous condition; and\\nB.Nephronophthiasis-medullary cystic disease complex,  a\\ncommon cause of chronic renal failure in juvenile age group.\\nA. MEDULLAR Y\\n SPONGE KIDNEY\\nMedullary sponge kidney consists of multiple cystic\\ndilatations of the papillary ducts in the medulla. It has anautosomal dominant transmission. The condition occurs inadults and may be recognised as an incidental radiographicfinding in asymptomatic cases, or the patients may complainof colicky flank pain, dysuria, haematuria and passage ofsandy material in the urine. Renal function remains largelyFigure 22.8 Polycystic kidney disease. Diagrammatic represent ation\\nof comparison of gross appearance of the two main forms.\\nFigure 22.9 Adult (autosomal dominant) polycystic kidney disease\\n(ADPKD). The kidney is enlarged and heavy. Sectioned surface shows\\nloss of demarcation between cortex and medulla and replacement of theentire renal parenchyma by cyst s varying in diameter from a fewmillimeters to 4-5 cm. These cysts are not communicating with the pelvi-calyceal system. The renal pelvis and calyces are distorted due to cysticchange.\\n659CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tractnormal or may be mildly impaired in long-standing disease\\nwith secondary complications of infection and calculusformation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the kidneys may\\nbe enlarged, normal or shrunken in size depending uponthe extent of secondary pyelonephritis. On cut surface,the characteristic feature is the presence of several, small(less than 0.5 cm diameter), cystically dilated papillaryducts, which may contain spherical calculi.\\nMicroscopically,  the cysts are lined by tall columnar,\\ncuboidal, transitional or squamous epithelium. Renal\\ncortex may show secondary pyelonephritis but corticalcysts are never a component of medullary sponge kidney.\\nB. NEPHRONOPHTHIASIS-MEDULLARY\\nCYSTIC DISEASE COMPLEX\\nThis form of medullary cystic disease, also called  juvenile\\nnephronophthiasis or uraemic sponge kidney, is a progressive\\nrenal disease. It is classified into infantile, juvenile andadolescent type depending upon the age at presentation,juvenile form being the most common. It is the most commonform of genetic cause of end-stage renal disease in childrenand adolescents. The condition has an autosomal recessiveinheritance. Familial occurrence is common. The clinicalmanifestations are due to impaired urinary concentrationconsequent upon the medullary lesions and consist of poly-uria, polydipsia and enuresis. Other features include renalosteodystrophy, growth retardation, anaemia andprogressive renal failure leading to uraemia.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the kidneys are\\nmoderately reduced in size and granular and have narrowcortices. Cut surface reveals minute cysts, majority ofwhich are present at the cortico-medullary junction.\\nMicroscopically,  the cysts are lined by flattened or\\ncuboidal epithelium. There is widespread nonspecific\\nchronic inflammatory infiltrate and interstitial fibrosis.Many glomeruli are hyalinised but tubular atrophy ismore pronounced due to marked thickening of tubularbasement membrane.IV. Simple Renal Cysts\\nSimple renal cysts are a very common postmortem finding.\\nThey are seen in about half of all persons above the age of 50years. Since these cysts are rare in infants and children, theyappear to be acquired rather than congenital lesions. Simplecysts of the kidneys are rarely responsible for symptoms.However, symptoms may result from rupture, haemorrhageor infection. The association between simple cysts andhypertension is common.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  simple renal\\ncysts are usually solitary but may be multiple. They arecommonly located in the cortex. Their size varies from afew millimeters to 10 cm in diameter. The wall of cyst ischaracteristically yellowish-white and translucent. Thecyst usually contains clear straw-coloured fluid which maybecome rust-coloured due to haemorrhage.Microscopically,  the lining of the cyst is by flattened\\nepithelium. The cyst wall contains variable amount ofcollagenised fibrous tissue which may occasionally havedeposits of haemosiderin or calcium salts.\\nV. Acquired Renal Cysts\\nA number of acquired conditions give rise to renal cysts.\\nThese include the following:\\n1. Patients with end-stage renal disease on prolonged\\ndialysis (dialysis-associated cystic disease).2. Hydatid (echinococcal) cyst.\\n3.\\nTuberculosis of the kidney.\\n4. Cystic degeneration in carcinoma of kidney.5. Traumatic intrarenal haematoma.\\n6. Drug-induced cystic disease in experimental animals.\\nVI. Pararenal Cysts\\nCysts occurring adjacent to a kidney are termed pararenal\\ncysts. These include the following:1.Pyelocalyceal cysts\\n2. Hilar lymphangiectatic cysts3.Retroperitoneal cysts\\n4.\\nPerinephric pseudocysts from trauma.\\uf075\\uf075TABLE 22.3.

Glomerulonephritis (GN)or Bright’s disease is the term used for diseases that primarilyinvolve the renal glomeruli. It is convenient to classifyglomerular diseases into 2 broad groups:\\nI.Primary glomerulonephritis  in which the glomeruli are the\\npredominant site of involvement.\\nII.Secondary glomerular diseases  include certain systemic and\\nhereditary diseases which secondarily affect the glomeruli.\\nThough this division is widely followed, it is somewhat\\narbitrary since many primary forms of glomerulonephritis\\nhave systemic effects, and many systemic diseases mayinitially present with glomerular involvement. Manyclassifications of different types of glomerulonephiritis havebeen described, but most widely accepted classification isbased on clinical presentation and pathologic changes in theglomeruli given in Table 22.4.\\nCLINICAL  MANIFESTA TIONS\\nThe clinical presentation of glomerular disease is quitevariable but in general four features—proteinuria, haema-turia, hypertension and disturbed excretory function, arepresent in varying combinations depending upon theunder\\nlying condition. A firm diagnosis, however, can be\\nestablished by examination of renal biopsy under light,\\nelectron and immunofluorescence microscopy.\\nA number of clinical syndromes are recognised in\\nglomerular diseases. The following are six major glomerular\\nsyndromes commonly found in different glomerular diseases:\\nnephritic and nephrotic syndromes;\\nacute and chronic renal failure;\\nasymptomatic proteinuria and haematuria.\\nThese are briefly described below.\\nI. ACUTE NEPHRITIC SYNDROME.  This is the acute\\nonset of haematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, oedema and\\noliguria following an infective illness about 10 to 20 days\\nearlier.\\n1. The haematuria  is generally slight giving the urine smoky\\nappearance and erythrocytes are detectable by microscopy\\nor by chemical testing for haemoglobin. Appearance of red\\ncell casts is another classical feature of acute nephriticsyndrome.\\n2.The proteinuria  is mild (less than 3 gm per 24 hrs) and is\\nusually non-selective (nephritic range proteinuria).\\n3.Hypertension  is variable depending upon the severity\\nof the glomerular disease but is generally mild.\\n4.Oedema  in nephritic syndrome is usually mild and\\nresults from sodium and water retention (page 97).5.Oliguria  is variable and reflects the severity of glomerular\\ninvolvement.\\nThe underlying causes of acute nephritic syndrome may\\nbe primary glomerulonephritic diseases (classically acute\\nglomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulo-nephritis) or certain systemic diseases (Table 22.5).\\nII.NEPHROTIC SYNDROME  Nephrotic syndrome is a\\nconstellation of features in different diseases having varyingpathogenesis; it is characterised by findings of massiveproteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hyperlipidaemia,\\nlipiduria, and hypercoagulability.\\n1.\\nHeavy proteinuria  (protein loss of more than 3 gm per\\n24 hrs) is the chief characteristic of nephrotic syndrome\\n(nephrotic range proteinuria). In children, protein loss is\\ncorrespondingly less. A small amount of protein (20 to 150mg/day) normally passes through the glomerular filtration\\nbarrier and is reabsorbed by the tubules. But in case of\\nincreased glomerular permeability to plasma proteins, excessof protein is filtered out exceeding the capacity of tubulesfor reabsorption and, therefore, appears in the urine. Another\\nfeature of protein loss is its ‘selectivity’. A highly-selective\\nproteinuria  consists mostly of loss of low molecular weight\\nproteins, while a poorly-selective proteinuria  is loss of high\\nmolecular weight proteins in the urine. In nephroticsyndrome, proteinuria mostly consists of loss of albumin\\n(molecular weight 66,000) in the urine.\\n2. Hypoalbuminaemia  is produced primarily consequent\\nto urinary loss of albumin, and partly due to increased renal\\ncatabolism and inadequate hepatic synthesis of albumin.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.4: Clinicopathologic Classification of  Glomerular\\nDiseases.\\nI.

Nail-patella syndrome661CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractOften, the plasma albumin level is 1 to 3 gm/dl (normal 3.5\\nto 5.5 gm/dl) and there is reversed albumin-globulin ratio.The concentration of other proteins in the plasma such asimmunoglobulins, clotting factors and antithrombin may fallrendering these patients more vulnerable to infections andthrombotic and thromboembolic complications.\\n3. Oedema  in nephrotic syndrome appears due to fall in\\ncolloid osmotic pressure consequent upon hypo-\\nalbuminaemia. Sodium and water retention furthercontribute to oedema. Nephrotic oedema is usuallyperipheral but in children facial oedema may be moreprominent (page 99).\\n4. Hyperlipidaemia  is a frequent accompaniment of\\nnephrotic syndrome. The exact mechanism of its genesis is\\nnot clear. It is hypothesised that the liver faced with the stressof massive protein synthesis in response to heavy urinaryprotein loss, also causes increased synthesis of lipoproteins.There are increased blood levels of total lipids, cholesterol,triglycerides, VLDL and LDL but decrease in HDL. Lowblood level of HDL is partly due to its loss in the urine.\\n5. Lipiduria  occurs following hyperlipidaemia due to\\nexcessive leakiness of glomerular filtration barrier.\\n6. Hypercoagulability.  Patients with nephrotic syndrome\\nmay develop spontaneous arterial or venous thrombosis,\\nrenal vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due tovarious factors. These include: increased urinary loss ofantithrombin III, hyperfibrinogenaemia from increasedsynthesis in the liver, decreased fibrinolysis, increasedplatelet aggregation and altered levels of protein C and S.\\nThe causes of nephrotic syndrome are diverse and are\\nlisted in Table 22.6.  The morphology of individual types is\\ndescribed later. But it must be mentioned here that:\\nin children,  primary glomerulonephritis is the cause in\\nmajority of cases of the nephrotic syndrome; most frequentis lipoid nephrosis (65%); and\\nin adults,  on the other hand, systemic diseases (diabetes,\\namyloidosis and SLE) are more frequent causes of nephroticsyndrome. The most common primary glomerular diseasein adults is membranous glomerulonephritis (40%).\\nFeatures of nephritic and nephroic syndromes have been\\ncontrasted in Table 22.7.III.ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  As already described above,\\nacute renal failure (ARF) is characterised by rapid decline inrenal function. ARF has many causes including glomerulardisease, principally rapidly progressive GN and acute diffuseproliferative GN.\\nIV.CHRONIC  RENAL FAILURE.  Glomerular causes of\\nchronic renal failure (CRF) have already been described.\\nThese cases have advanced renal impairment progressingover years and is detected by significant proteinuria,haematuria, hypertension and azotaemia. Such patientsgenerally have small contracted kidneys due to chronicglomerulonephritis.\\nV.\\nASYMPTOMATIC PROTEINURIA.  Presence of\\nproteinuria unexpectedly in a patient may be unrelated to\\nrenal disease (e.g. exercise-induced, extreme lordosis andorthostatic proteinuria), or may indicate an underlying mildglomerulonephritis. Association of asymptomatichaematuria, hypertension or impaired renal function withasymptomatic proteinuria should raise strong suspicion ofunderlying glomerulonephritis.\\nVI.

This view is largely based on immuno-fluorescence studies of GN in humans which have revealedglomerular deposits of immunoglobulins and complementin patterns that closely resemble those of experimentalmodels. The consequences of injury at different sites withinthe glomerulus in various glomerular diseases can beassessed when compared with the normal physiologic roleof the main cells involved i.e. endothelial, mesangial, visceral\\nepithelial,  and parietal epithelial cells  as well as of the GBM   as\\nsummed up in Table 22.8.\\nImmunologic mechanisms underlying glomerular\\ninjury are primarily antibody-mediated (immune-complex\\ndisease). There is evidence to suggest that cell-mediated\\nimmune reactions  in the form of delayed type hypersensiti-\\nvity can also cause glomerular injury in some situations.In addition, a few secondary mechanisms and some non-immunologic mechanisms are involved in the pathogene-sis of some forms of glomerular diseases in human beings(Table 22.9).\\nI.IMMUNOLOGIC MECHANISMS\\nExperimental studies and observations in humans have\\nrevealed that immunologic mechanisms, most importantlyantigen-antibody complexes, underlie most forms ofglomerular injury. The general principles of thesemechanisms in different forms of glomerular diseases arediscussed below, while specific features pertaining toindividual types of GN are described separately later.\\nA.Antibody-Mediated Glomerular Injury\\n1.IMMUNE COMPLEX DISEASE.  Majority of cases of\\nglomerular disease result from deposits of immune\\ncomplexes (antigen-antibody complexes). The immunecomplexes are represented by irregular or granular glomer-\\nular deposits  of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA) and\\ncomplement (mainly C3). Based on the experimental modelsand studies in human beings, the following 3 patterns ofglomerular deposits of immune complexes in variousglomerular diseases have been observed as illustrated inFig. 22.10 :\\ni)Exclusive mesangial deposits are characterised by very mild\\nform of glomerular disease.\\nii)Extensive subendothelial deposits  along the GBM are\\naccompanied by severe hypercellular sclerosing glomerular\\nlesions.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.7: Contrasting Features of Acute Nephritic and Nephrotic Syndromes.\\nFeature Acute Nephritic Syndrome Nephrotic Syndrome\\n1.

Now, it has been\\nshown that glomerular deposits are formed by one of thefollowing two mechanisms:i) Local immune complex deposits.  Formation of\\nglomerular deposits of immune complex in situ  occurs as aresult of combination of antibodies with autologous non-basement membrane antigens or nonglomerular antigensplanted on glomeruli. Currently, this mechanism isconsidered responsible for most cases of immune complexGN. Classic experimental model of in situ  immune complex\\nGN is Heymann nephritis  (autologous immune complex\\nnephritis) induced in rats by immunising animals withhomologous preparations of proximal tubular brush border.The rats develop antibodies to brush border antigens andthereby membranous GN that closely resembles humanFigure 22.10 Diagrammatic representation of ultrastructure  of a portion of glomerular lobule.

The examples of planted non-glomerular\\nantigens  are cationic proteins, lectins, DNA, bacterial products\\n(e.g. a protein of group A streptococci), viral and parasitic\\nproducts and drugs.\\nii) Circulating immune complex deposits. This mechanism\\nused to be considered very important for glomerular injury\\nbut now it is believed that circulating immune complexescause glomerular damage under certain circumstances only.These situations are: their presence in high concentrationsfor prolonged periods, or when they possess specialproperties that cause their binding to glomeruli, or when hostmechanisms are defective and fail to eliminate immunecomplexes. The antigens evoking antibody response may beendogenous (e.g. in SLE) or may be exogenous (e.g. HepatitisB virus, Treponema pallidum, Plasmodium falciparum  and\\nvarious tumour antigens). The antigen-antibody complexesare formed in the circulation and then trapped in theglomeruli where they produce glomerular injury aftercombining with complement.\\nImmune complex GN is observed in the following human\\ndiseases:\\ni)Primary GN  e.g. acute diffuse proliferative GN, memb-\\nranous GN, membranoproliferative GN, IgA nephropathy\\nand some cases of rapidly progressive GN and focal GN.\\nii)Systemic diseases  e.g. glomerular disease in SLE, malaria,\\nsyphilis, hepatitis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura and idiopathic\\nmixed cryoglobulinaemia.\\n2. ANTI-GBM DISEASE.  Less than 5% cases of human GN\\nare associated with anti-GBM antibodies. The constituent of\\nGBM acting as antigen appears to be a component of collagenIV of the basement membrane. The experimental model ofanti-GBM disease is Masugi nephritis (nephrotoxic serum\\nnephritis) produced in rats by injection of heterologousantibodies against GBM prepared in rabbits by immunisationwith rat kidney glomerular tissue.\\nAnti-GBM disease is classically characterised by\\ninterrupted linear deposits  of anti-GBM antibodies (mostly IgG;\\nrarely IgA and IgM) and complement (mainly C3) along theglomerular basement membrane. These deposits are detectedby immunofluorescence microscopy or by electronmicroscopy.\\nAnti-GBM disease is characteristically exemplified by\\nglomerular injury in Goodpasture’s syndrome in some casesof rapidly progressive GN. About half to two-third of thepatients with renal lesions in Goodpasture’s syndrome havepulmonary haemorrhage mediated by cross-reactingautoantibodies against alveolar basement membrane (page494).\\n3. ALTERNATE PATHWAY DISEASE.  As apparent from\\nthe above mechanisms, the complement system, in\\nparticular C3, contributes to glomerular injury in mostforms of GN. Deposits of C3 are associated with the earlycomponents C1, C2 and C4 which are evidence of classicpathway activation of complement. But in alternatepathway activation, there is decreased serum C3 level,decreased serum levels of factor B and properdin, normalserum levels of C1, C2 and C4 but C3 and properdin arefound deposited in the glomeruli without immunoglobulindeposits, reflecting activation of alternate pathway ofcomplement. Such patients have circulating anti-comple -\\nmentary nephritic factor (C3NeF) which is an IgG antibodyand acts as an autoantibody to the alternate C3 convertase,leading to persistent alternate pathway activation.\\nThe deposits in alternate pathway disease are charac-\\nteristically electron-dense under electron microscopy;glomerular lesions in such cases are referred to as dense-\\ndeposit disease.\\nAlternate pathway disease occurs in most cases of type\\nII membranoproliferative GN, some patients of rapidlyprogressive GN, acute diffuse proliferative GN, IgAnephropathy and in SLE.\\n4. OTHER MECHANISMS OF ANTIBODY-MEDIATED\\nINJURY.  A few autoantibodies have been implicated in some\\npatients of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and few othertypes of GN. These antibodies include the following:\\ni) Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).  About\\n40% cases of rapidly progressive GN are deficient in\\nimmunoglobulins in glomeruli (pauciimmune GN) and arepositive for ANCA against neutrophil cytoplasmic antigensin their circulation. ANCA causes endothelial injury bygeneration of reactive oxygen radicals. ANCA-mediatedvasculitis is also seen in Wegenger’s granulomatosis andChurg-Strauss syndrome.\\nii\\n) Anti-endothelial cell antibodies  (AECA).  Auto-\\nantibodies against endothelial antigens have been detected\\nin circulation in several inflammatory vasculitis andglomerulonephritis. These antibodies increase theadhesiveness of leucocytes to endothelial cells.\\nB. Cell-mediated Glomerular Injury\\n(Delayed-type Hypersensitivity)\\nThere is evidence to suggest that cell-mediated immune\\nreactions may be involved in causing glomerular injury,particularly in cases with deficient immunoglobulins (e.g.in pauci-immune type glomerulonephritis in RPGN).Cytokines and other mediators released by activated T cellsstimulate cytotoxicity, recruitment of more leucocytes andfibrogenesis. CD4+ T lymphocytes recruit more macrophageswhile CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cellscause further glomerular cell injury by antibody-dependentcell toxicity. Soluble factor derived from T lymphocytes isimplicated in proteinuria in minimal change disease and focalGS.\\nHowever, cell-mediated injury is yet less clear than\\nantibody-mediated glomerular injury.\\nC. Secondary Pathogenetic Mechanisms\\n(Mediators of Immunologic Injury)\\nSecondary pathogenetic mechanisms are a number of\\nmediators of immunologic glomerular injury operating inman and in experimental models. These include thefollowing:\\n1. NEUTROPHILS.  Neutrophils are conspicuous in certain\\nforms of glomerular disease such as in acute diffuse prolife-\\nrative GN, and may also be present in membranoproliferative665CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractGN and lupus nephritis. Neutrophils can mediate glomerular\\ninjury by activation of complement as well as by release ofproteases, arachidonic acid metabolites and oxygen-derivedfree radicals. These agents cause degradation of GBM andcell injury.\\n2. MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES.  Many forms of\\nhuman and experimental proliferative GN are associated\\nwith glomerular infiltration by monocytes and macrophages.Accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes is considered animportant constituent of hypercellularity in these forms ofGN aside from proliferation of mesangial and endothelialcells. Activated macrophages release a variety of biologicallyactive substances which take part in glomerular injury.\\n3.\\nCOMPLEMENT SYSTEM.  The pathogenetic role of\\nclassical and alternate pathway of activation of complement\\nhas already been highlighted above. Besides the componentsof complement which mediate glomerular injury vianeutrophils already mentioned, C5bC6789 (MAC, acronymfor membrane attack complex, also called terminal complex)is capable of inducing damage to GBM directly.\\n4. PLATELETS.  Platelet aggregation and release of\\nmediators play a role in the evolution of some forms of GN.\\nIncreased intrarenal platelet consumption has been found tooccur in some forms of glomerular disease.\\n5. MESANGIAL CELLS.  There is evidence to suggest that\\nmesangial cells present in the glomeruli may be stimulated\\nto produce mediators of inflammation and take part inglomerular injury.\\n6. COAGULATION SYSTEM.  The presence of fibrin in\\nearly crescents in certain forms of human and experimental\\nGN suggests the role of coagulation system in glomerulardamage. Fibrinogen may leak into Bowman’s space and actas stimulus for cell proliferation. Crescents usually transforminto scar tissue under the influence of fibronectin which isregularly present in crescents in human glomerular disease.\\nII. NON-IMMUNOLOGIC MECHANISMS\\nThough most forms of GN are mediated by immunologic\\nmechanisms, a few examples of glomerular injury by non-immunologic mechanisms are found:\\n1.Metabolic glomerular injury  e.g. in diabetic nephropathy\\n(due to hyperglycaemia), Fabry’s disease (due to sulfatidosis).\\n2.Haemodynamic glomerular injury  e.g. systemic hyper-\\ntension, intraglomerular hypertension in FSGS.\\n3.Deposition diseases  e.g. amyloidosis.\\n4.Infectious diseases  e.g. HBV, HCV, HIV, E. coli -derived\\nnephrotoxin.5. Drugs  e.g. minimal change disease due to NSAIDs.\\n6.Inherited glomerular diseases  e.g. Alport’s syndrome, nail-\\npatella syndrome.\\nThe evolution of end-stage renal failure  in glomerular injury\\nis explained on the basis of adaptive glomerular hypertrophy\\nof unaffected glomeruli that results in increased glomerularblood flow and increased glomerular capillary pressureinducing intraglomerular hypertension. These events leadto increased deposition of mesangial matrix and proliferationof mesangial cells, endothelial and epithelial cell injury, andeventually to progressive glomerulosclerosis and end-stagerenal failure.\\nSPECIFIC  TYPES OF GLOMERULAR DISEASES\\nClassification of different forms of glomerular diseases is\\nalready presented in Table 22.4. Features of individual typesare described below and a summary of major forms ofprimary glomerulonephritis is given in  Table 22.11  at the\\nend of this discussion.\\nI. PRIMARY GLOMERULONEPHRITIS\\nAcute Glomerulonephritis\\n(Synonyms: Acute Diffuse Proliferative GN,\\nDiffuse Endocapillary GN)\\nAcute GN is known to follow acute infection and charac-teristically presents as acute nephritic syndrome. Based onetiologic agent, acute GN is subdivided into 2 main groups:acute post-streptococcal GN and acute non-streptococcal GN,the former being more common.\\nACUTE POST-STREPTOCOCCAL GN\\nAcute post-streptococcal GN, though uncommon and\\nsporadic in the Western countries, is a common form of GNin developing countries, mostly affecting children between2 to 14 years of age but 10% cases are seen in adults above 40years of age. The onset of disease is generally sudden after\\n1-2 weeks of streptococcal infection, most frequently of the\\nthroat (e.g. streptococcal pharyngitis) and sometimes of theskin (e.g. streptococcal impetigo).\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The relationship between\\nstreptococcal infection and this form of GN is now well\\nestablished. Particularly nephritogenic are types 12,4,1 andRed Lake of group A β-haemolytic streptococci (compare the\\netiologic agent with that of RHD, page 438). The glomerularlesions appear to result from deposition of immunecomplexes in the glomeruli. The evidences cited in supportare as under:\\ni)There is epidemiological  evidence of preceding strepto-\\ncoccal sore throat or skin infection about 1-2 weeks prior to\\nthe attack.\\nii) The latent period  between streptococcal infection and onset\\nof clinical manifestations of the disease is compatible with\\nthe period required for building up of antibodies.\\niii)Streptococcal infection may be identified by culture  or\\nmay be inferred from elevated titres of antibodies  against\\nstreptococcal antigens. These include the following:\\nanti-streptolysin O (ASO);\\nanti-deoxyribonuclease B (anti-DNAse B);\\nanti-streptokinase (ASKase);\\nanti-nicotinyl adenine dinucleotidase (anti-NADase); and\\nanti-hyaluronidase (AHase).\\niv) There is usually hypocomplementaemia indicating\\ninvolvement of complement in the glomerular deposits.\\nv) It has also been possible to identify antigenic component\\nof streptococci which is cytoplasmic antigen, endostreptosin.666SECTION III Systemic PathologyMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.

The cortical as well as sectioned surfaceshow petechial haemorrhages giving the characteristicappearance of flea-bitten kidney (Fig. 22.11) .\\nLight microscopic findings  are as under (Fig. 22.12) :\\ni)Glomeruli —The glomeruli are affected diffusely. They\\nare enlarged and hypercellular. The diffuse hyper-cellularity of the tuft is due to proliferation of mesangial,endothelial and occasionally epithelial cells (acute\\nproliferative lesions)  as well as by infiltration of leucocytes,chiefly polymorphs and sometimes monocytes ( acute\\nexudative lesion ). There may be small deposits of fibrin\\nwithin the capillary lumina and in the mesangium.\\nii)Tubules —Tubular changes are not very striking.\\nThere may be swelling and hyaline droplets in tubular\\ncells, and tubular lumina may contain red cell casts.iii)\\nInterstitium —There may be some degree of interstitial\\noedema and leucocytic infiltration.iv) Vessels —Changes in arteries and arterioles are seldom\\npresent in acute GN.Electron microscopic findings,  aside from confirming the\\nlight microscopic findings, demonstrate the characteristicelectron-dense irregular deposits (‘humps’)  on the\\nepithelial side of the GBM. These deposits represent theimmune complexes  (Fig. 22.13) .\\nImmunofluorescence microscopy  reveals that the irregular\\ndeposits along the GBM consist principally of IgG andcomplement C3.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Typically, the patient is a young\\nchild, presenting with acute nephritic syndrome (page 660),having sudden and abrupt onset following an episode of sorethroat or skin infection 1-2 weeks prior to the developmentof symptoms. The features include microscopic orintermittent haematuria, red cell casts, mild non-selectiveproteinuria (less than 3 gm per 24 hrs), hypertension,periorbital oedema and variably oliguria. Less often, thepresentation may be as nephrotic syndrome. In adults, thefeatures are atypical and include sudden hypertension,oedema and azotaemia. Development of hypertension ineither case is a poor prognostic sign.\\nPrognosis  varies with the age of the patient. Children\\nalmost always (95%) recover completely with reversal ofproliferative glomerular changes. Complications arise moreoften in adults and occasionally in children. These includedevelopment of rapidly progressive GN, chronic GN,uraemia and chronic renal failure.\\nFigure 22.11 Flea-bitten kidney. The kidney is enlarged in size and\\nweight. The cortex shows tiny petechial haemorrhages visible through\\nthe capsule (arrow).\\nFigure 22.12 Acute post-streptococcal GN, light microscopic appearance. There is increased cellularity due to proliferation of mesangial cel ls,\\nendothelial cells and some epithelial cells and infiltration of the tuft by neutrophils and monocytes.\\n667CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractACUTE NON-STREPTOCOCCAL GN\\nAbout one-third cases of acute GN are caused by organisms\\nother than haemolytic streptococci. These include otherbacteria (e.g. staphylococci, pneumococci, meningococci,Salmonella  and Pseudomonas),  viruses (e.g. hepatitis B virus,\\nmumps, infectious mononucleosis and varicella), parasiticinfections (e.g. malaria, toxoplasmosis and schistosomiasis)and syphilis. The appearance of renal biopsy by lightmicroscopy, EM and immunofluorescence microscopy issimilar to that seen in acute post-streptococcal GN. Theprognosis of non-streptococcal GN is not as good as that ofstreptococcal GN.\\nRapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis\\n(Synonyms: RPGN, Crescentic GN, Extracapillary GN)\\nRPGN presents with an acute reduction in renal function\\nresulting in acute renal failure in a few weeks or months. Itis characterised by formation of ‘crescents’ (crescentic GN)\\noutside the glomerular capillaries (extracapillary GN).\\n‘Crescents’  are formed from the proliferation of parietal\\nepithelial cells lining Bowman’s capsule with contributionfrom visceral epithelial cells and the invading mononuclearcells. The stimulus for crescent formation appears to be thepresence of fibrin in the capsular space. RPGN occurs mostfrequently in adults, with a slight male preponderance.Prognosis of RPGN in general is dismal.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  A number of primary glomerular\\nand systemic diseases are characterised by formation of\\ncrescents. Based on the etiologic agents and pathogeneticmechanism, patients with RPGN are divided into 3 groups(Table 22.10):\\nRPGN in systemic diseases (anti-GBM type);\\npost-infectious RPGN (immune-complex type); and\\npauci-immune RPGN.\\nFollowing three serologic markers are used for\\ncategorising RPGN:\\ni) serum C3 level,\\nii) anti-GBM antibody; and\\niii) anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA).\\nType I RPGN: Anti-GBM disease.  A number of systemic\\ndiseases such as Goodpasture’s syndrome, SLE, vasculitis,\\nWegener’s granulomatosis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura andidiopathic mixed cryoglobulinaemia are associated withcrescentic GN. Goodpasture’s syndrome is the characteristicexample of anti-GBM disease and is described below:\\nGoodpasture’s syndrome.  Goodpasture’s syndrome is\\ncharacterised by acute renal failure due to RPGN and\\npulmonary haemorrhages (page 494). The condition is morecommon in males in 3rd decade of life. The disease resultsfrom damage to the glomeruli by anti-GBM antibodies whichcross-react with alveolar basement membrane and hence,produce renal as well as pulmonary lesions. The evidencesin support are the characteristic linear deposits of anti-GBMantibodies consisting of IgG and complement along the GBM,detection of circulating anti-GBM antibodies and inductionof glomerular lesions with injection of anti-GBM antibodiesexperimentally in monkeys. Pulmonary lesions can be experi-Figure 22.13 Acute glomerulonephritis, diagrammatic represen-\\ntation of ultrastructure of a portion of glomerular lobule showing\\ncharacteristic electron-dense irregular deposit s or ‘hump s’ on the epithelialside of the GBM.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.10: Distinguishing Features of Three Main Categories of Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis.\\nFeature Type I RPGN Type II RPGN Type III RPGN\\n(Anti-GBM Disease) (Immune Complex Disease) (Pauci-immune GN)\\n1.\\nClinical syndrome Nephritic Nephritic Nephritic\\n2.

TheGoodpasture’s antigen appears to be a component of collagentype IV.\\nType II RPGN: Immune complex  disease.  A small propor-\\ntion of cases of post-streptococcal GN, particularly in adults\\nand sometimes of non-streptococcal origin, develop RPGN.The evidences in support of post-infectious RPGN havingimmune complex pathogenesis are granular deposits ofimmune complexes of IgG and C3 along the glomerularcapillary walls, lowering of blood complement levels anddemonstration of circulating complexes.\\nType III RPGN: Pauci-immune GN.  These include cases of\\nWegener’s granulomatosis and microscopic polyarteritis\\nnodosa. The pathogenesis of pauci-immune GN is yet notfully defined. However, majority of these patients are ANCA-positive, implying a defect in humoral immunity. Serumcomplement levels are normal and anti-GBM antibody isnegative. There is little or no glomerular immune deposit(i.e. pauci-immune).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the kidneys are\\nusually enlarged and pale with smooth outer surface (large\\nwhite kidney). Cut surface shows pale cortex and congestedmedulla.\\nLight Microscopic findings  vary according to the cause\\nbut in general following features are present (Fig. 22.14) :\\ni) Glomeruli —Irrespective of the underlying etiology,\\nall forms of RPGN show pathognomonic ‘crescents’  on the\\ninside of Bowman’s capsules. These are collections of pale-\\nstaining polygonal cells which commonly tend to beelongated. Eventually, crescents obliterate the Bowman’sspace and compress the glomerular tuft. Fibrin depositionis invariably present alongside crescents. Besides thecrescents, glomerular tufts may show increased cellularityas a result of proliferation of endothelial and mesangialcells and leucocytic infiltration. Fibrin thrombi arefrequently present in the glomerular tufts.\\nii)\\nTubules —Tubular epithelial cells may show hyaline\\ndroplets. Tubular lumina may contain casts, red blood\\ncells and fibrin.\\niii)Interstitium —The interstitium is oedematous and\\nmay show early fibrosis. Inflammatory cells, usually\\nlymphocytes and plasma cells, are commonly distributed\\nin the interstitial tissue.\\niv) Vessels —Arteries and arterioles may show no change,\\nbut cases associated with hypertension usually show\\nsevere vascular changes.\\nElectron microscopic findings  vary according to the type\\nof RPGN. Post-infectious RPGN cases show electron-dense\\nsubepithelial granular deposits similar to those seen inacute GN, while cases of RPGN in Goodpasture’ssyndrome show characteristic linear deposits along theGBM (Fig. 22.15) .\\nImmunofluorescence microscopy  shows following\\npatterns in various types of RPGN:\\nlinear pattern of RPGN in Goodpasture’s syndrome\\n(type I RPGN), containing IgG accompanied by C3 alongthe capillaries.\\nGranular pattern of post-infectious RPGN (type II\\nRPGN) consisting of IgG and C3 along the capillary wall.\\nScanty or no deposits of immunoglobulin and C3 in\\npauci-immune GN (type III RPGN).\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Generally, the features of post-\\ninfectious RPGN are similar to those of acute GN, presentingas acute renal failure. The patients of Goodpasture’ssyndrome may present as acute renal failure and/orassociated intrapulmonary haemorrhage producingrecurrent haemoptysis. Prognosis of all forms of RPGN ispoor. However, post-infectious cases have somewhat betteroutcome and may show recovery.Figure 22.14 RPGN (post-infectious type), light microscopic appearance. There are crescents in Bowman’s space forming adhesions between\\nthe glomerular tuft and Bowman’s capsule. The tuft shows hypercellularity and leucocytic infiltration.\\n669CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractMinimal Change Disease\\n(Synonyms: MCD, Lipoid Nephrosis, Foot Process\\nDisease, Nil Deposit Disease)\\nMinimal change disease   (MCD) is a condition in which the\\nnephrotic syndrome is accompanied by no apparent changein glomeruli by light microscopy. Its other synonyms, lipoidnephrosis and foot process disease, are descriptive terms forfatty changes in the tubules and electron microscopicappearance of flattened podocytes respectively. Minimalchange disease accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndromein children under 16 years of age with preponderance in boys(ratio of boys to girls 2:1). In fact, historically, lipoid nephrosiswas the first condition associated with nephrotic sndrome.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The etiology of MCD remain\\nelusive. However, following two groups have been\\nidentified:\\ni) Idiopathic (majority of cases).\\nii) Cases associated with systemic diseases (Hodgkin’s\\ndisease, HIV infection) and drug therapy (e.g. NSAIDs,rifampicin, interferon- α).\\nThe following features point to possible immunologic\\npathogenesis for MCD:\\ni) Absence of deposits by immunofluorescence microscopy.\\nii)\\nNormal circulating levels of complement but presence\\nof circulating immune complexes in many cases.iii) Universal satisfactory response to steroid therapy.\\niv) Evidence of increased suppressor T cell activity with\\nelaboration of cytokines (interleukin-8, tumour necrosisfactor) which probably cause foot process flattening andaltered charge on the GBM.\\nv) Detection of a mutation in nephrin gene in cases of\\ncongenital MCD has focused attention on genetic basis.\\nNephrotic syndrome in MCD in children  is characterised\\nby selective proteinuria  containing mainly albumin, andminimal amounts of  high molecular weight proteins such as\\nα2-macroglobulin. The basis for selective proteinuria appears\\nto be as under:\\ni) Reduction of normal negative charge on GBM (page 650)\\ndue to loss of heparan sulfate proteoglycan from the GBM.\\nii) Change in the shape of epithelial cells producing foot\\nprocess flattening due to reduction of sialoglycoprotein cellcoat.\\nAdults  having MCD, however, have non-selective  protein-\\nuria, suggesting more extensive membrane permeability\\ndefect.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the kidneys are\\nof normal size and shape.\\nBy light microscopy,  the findings are as under\\n(Fig. 22.16,A) :\\ni) Glomeruli —The most characteristic feature is no\\napparent abnormality in the glomeruli except for slight\\nincrease in the mesangial matrix at the most (minimalchange disease or nil lesion).\\nii)\\nTubules —There is presence of fine lipid vacuolation\\nand hyaline droplets in the cells of proximal convoluted\\ntubules and, hence, the older name of the condition as‘lipoid nephrosis’.\\niii) Interstitium —There may be oedema of the\\ninterstitium.\\niv) Vessels —Blood vessels do not show any significant\\nchange.\\nBy electron microscopy,  the most characteristic feature of\\nthe disease is identified which is diffuse flattening of foot\\nprocesses of the visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) and,hence, the name foot process disease or podocytopathy(Fig. 22.16,B) . Unlike other forms of GN, no deposits are\\nseen and the GBM is normal.By immunofluorescence microscopy,  no deposits of\\ncomplement or immunoglobulins are recognised (nildeposit disease).\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The classical presentation of MCD\\nis of fully-developed nephrotic syndrome with massive andhighly selective proteinuria, but hypertension is unusual. Most\\nfrequently, the patients are children under 16 years (peakincidence at 6-8 years of age).\\nThe onset may be preceded by an upper respiratory\\ninfection, atopic allergy or immunisation.\\nThe disease characteristically responds to steroid therapy.\\nIn spite of remissions and relapses, long-term prognosis isvery good and most children become free of albuminuriaafter several years.\\nMembranous Glomerulonephritis\\n(Synonym: Epimembranous Nephropathy)\\nMembranous GN is characterised by widespread thickening\\nof the glomerular capillary wall and is the most commoncause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. In majority of cases(85%), membranous GN is truly idiopathic , while in about\\n15% of cases it is secondary  to an underlying condition (e.g.Figure 22.15 RPGN, diagrammatic representation of ultrastructure\\nof a portion of glomerular lobule showing epithelial crescent formation\\nand subepithelial granular deposits.\\n670SECTION III Systemic PathologySLE, malignancies, infections such as chronic hepatitis B and\\nC, syphilis, malaria and drugs).\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS. Idiopathic membranous  GN is an\\nimmune complex disease. The deposits of immune complex\\nare formed locally because circulating immune complexesare detected in less than a quarter of cases. Since leucocyticinfiltration is not a feature of membranous GN, damage to\\nthe GBM is mediated directly by complement. While\\nnephritogenic antigen against which autoantibodies areformed in idiopathic membranous  GN is not known yet, the\\nantigen in cases of secondary membranous  GN is either an\\nendogenous (e.g. DNA in SLE) or exogenous one (e.g.hepatitis B virus, tumour antigen, treponema antigen, drugtherapy with penicillamine). Currently, pathogenesis ofmembrane alteration in membranous GN is believed to beby MAC (membrane attack complex i.e. C35b-C9) terminalcomplex on podocytes.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the kidneys are\\nenlarged, pale and smooth.\\nLight microscopy  shows the following findings\\n(Fig. 22.17) :\\ni) Glomeruli —The characteristic finding is diffuse\\nthickening of the glomerular capillary walls with all the\\nglomeruli being affected more or less uniformly. As thedisease progresses, the deposits are incorporated into\\nenormously thickened basement membrane, producing\\n‘duplication’ of GBM which is actually formation of a newbasement membrane. These basement membrane changesare best appreciated by silver impregnation stains (black\\ncolour) or by periodic acid-Schiff stain (pink colour). There\\nis no cellular proliferation in the glomerular tufts.\\nii)Tubules —The renal tubules remain normal except in\\nthe early stage when lipid vacuolation of the proximal\\nconvoluted tubules may be seen.Figure 22.16 Minimal change disease. A, Light microscopy shows a normal glomerulus while tubules show cytoplasmic vacuolation and\\nproteinaceous material. B, Diagrammatic representation of ultrastructure  of a portion of glomerular lobule showing diffuse fus ion or flattening of foot\\nprocesses of visceral epithelial cells (podocytes). The GBM is normal and there are no deposits.\\nFigure 22.17 Membranous GN, light microscopic appearance.  Glomeruli are normocellular but the capillary walls are dif fusely thickened due\\nto duplication of the GBM.\\n671CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tractiii)Interstitium —The interstitium may show fine fibrosis\\nand scanty chronic inflammatory cells.\\niv) Vessels —In the early stage, vascular changes are not\\nprominent, while later hypertensive changes of arterioles\\nmay occur.\\nElectron microscopy  shows characteristic electron-dense\\ndeposits in subepithelial location. The basement\\nmembrane material protrudes between deposits as ‘spikes’(Fig. 22.18) .\\nImmunofluorescence microscopy  reveals granular deposits\\nof immune complexes consisting of IgG associated withcomplement C3. In secondary cases of membranous GNthe relevant antigen such as hepatitis B or tumour antigenmay be seen.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The presentation in majority of\\ncases is insidious onset of nephrotic syndrome in an adult.The proteinuria is usually of non-selective  type. In addition,\\nmicroscopic haematuria and hypertension may be presentat the onset or may develop during the course of the disease.The changes in membranous GN are irreversible in majorityof patients. Progression to impaired renal function and end-stage renal disease with progressive azotaemia occurs inapproximately 50% cases within a span of 2 to 20 years. Renalvein thrombosis has been found to develop in patients withmembranous GN due to hypercoagulability. The role andbeneficial effects of steroid therapy with or without theaddition of immunosuppressive drugs is debatable.\\nMembranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis\\n(Synonyms: MPGN, Mesangiocapillary GN)\\nMembranoproliferative GN is another important cause of\\nnephrotic syndrome in children and young adults. As thename implies, it is characterised by two histologic features—increase in cellularity of the mesangium associated withincreased lobulation of the tuft, and irregular thickening ofthe capillary wall.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Etiology of MPGN is unknown\\nthough in some cases there is evidence of preceding\\nstreptococcal infection. Based on ultrastructural,immunofluorescence and pathogenetic mechanisms, threetypes of MPGN are recognised:\\nType I or classic form  is an example of immune complex\\ndisease and comprises more than 70% cases. It is charac-terised by immune deposits in the subendothelial position.Immune-complex MPGN is seen in association with systemicimmune-complex diseases (e.g. SLE, mixed cryoglo-bulinaemia, Sjögren’s syndrome), chronic infections (e.g.bacterial endocarditis, HIV, hepatitis B and C) andmalignancies (e.g. lymphomas and leukaemias).\\nType II or dense deposit disease  is the example of alter-\\nnate pathway disease (page 664) and constitutes about 30%cases. The capillary wall thickening is due to the depositionof electron-dense material in the lamina densa of the GBM.Type II MPGN is an autoimmune disease in which patientshave IgG autoantibody termed C3 nephritic factor. Type IIcases have an association with partial lipodystrophy, anunusual condition of unknown pathogenesis characterisedby symmetrical loss of subcutaneous fat from the upper halfof the body.\\nType III  is rare and shows features of type I MPGN and\\nmembranous nephropathy in association with systemicdiseases or drugs.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly and by light\\nmicroscopy, all the three types of MPGN are similar.\\nGrossly,  the kidneys are usually pale in appearance and\\nfirm in consistency.\\nBy light microscopy,  the features are as under (Fig. 22.19) :\\ni) Glomeruli —Glomeruli show highly characteristic\\nchanges. They are enlarged with accentuated lobular\\npattern. The enlargement is due to variable degree ofmesangial cellular proliferation and increase in mesangialmatrix. The GBM is considerably thickened, which withsilver stains shows two basement membranes with a clearzone between them. This is commonly referred to as‘double contour’, splitting, or ‘tram track’ appearance.\\nii)\\nTubules —Tubular cells may show vacuolation and\\nhyaline droplets.\\niii) Interstitium —There may be scattered chronic\\ninflammatory cells and some finely granular foam cells\\nin the interstitium.\\niv) Vessels —Vascular changes are prominent in cases in\\nwhich hypertension develops.\\nBy electron microscopy and immunofluorescence micros-\\ncopy,  the changes are different in the three types of MPGN\\n(Fig. 22.20) :\\nType I:  It shows electron-dense deposits  in subendothelial\\nlocation conforming to immune-complex character of thedisease. These deposits reveal positive fluorescence forC3 and slightly fainter staining for IgG.Figure 22.18 Membranous GN, diagrammatic represent ation of\\nultrastructure  of a portion of glomerular lobule showing subepithelial\\ndeposits of electron-dense material so that the basement membranematerial protrudes between these deposit s.\\n672SECTION III Systemic PathologyType II:  The hallmark of type II MPGN is the presence of\\ndense amorphous deposits  within the lamina densa of the\\nGBM and in the mesangium. Immunofluorescence studies\\nreveal the universal presence of C3 and properdin in thedeposits but the immunoglobulins are usually absent.\\nType III:  This rare form has electron-dense deposits  within\\nthe GBM as well as in subendothelial and subepithelial\\nregions of the GBM. Immunofluorescence studies showthe presence of C3, IgG and IgM.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinically, there are many\\nsimilarities between the main forms of MPGN. The mostcommon age at diagnosis is between 15 and 20 years.Appr oximately 50% of the patients present with nephrotic\\nsyndrome; about 30% have asymptomatic proteinuria; and\\n20% have nephritic syndrome at presentation. Theproteinuria is non-selective. Haematuria and hypertensionare frequently present. Hypocomplementaemia is a common\\nfeature. With time, majority of patients progress to renal\\nfailure, while some continue to have proteinuria, haematuriaand hypertension with stable renal function.\\nPrognosis of type I is relatively better and majority of\\npatients survive without clinically significant impairment ofGFR, while type II cases run a variable clinical course.\\nFocal Proliferative Glomerulonephritis\\n(Synonym:  Mesangial Proliferative GN)\\nFocal proliferative GN is characterised by pathologic changes\\nin certain number of glomeruli (focal),  and often confined to\\none or two lobules of the affected glomeruli (segmental),  while\\nother glomeruli are normal. Focal GN is, thus, a pathologic\\ndiagnosis.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS . It may occur under following\\ndiverse clinical settings:\\nAs an early manifestation of a number of systemic diseases\\nsuch as SLE, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, subacute bacterial\\nendocarditis, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and polyarteritis\\nnodosa, Goodpasture’s syndrome.\\nAs a component of a known renal disease such as in IgA\\nnephropathy.\\nAs a primary idiopathic  glomerular disease unrelated to\\nsystemic or other renal disease.\\nThe diverse settings under which focal GN is encountered\\nmake it unlikely that there are common etiologic agents orpathogenetic mechanisms. However, the observation ofmesangial deposits of immunoglobulins and complementsuggest immune complex disease and participation of themesangium.Figure 22.19 Membranoproliferative GN, light microscopic appearance. The glomerular tufts show lobulation and mesangial hypercellularity.\\nThere is increase in the mesangial matrix between the capillaries. There is widespread thickening of the GBM.\\nFigure 22.20 MPGN, diagrammatic representation of ultrastructure\\nof a portion of glomerular lobule showing features of type I (left half) and\\ntype II (right half) MPGN. Type I (classic form) shows the characteristicsubendothelial electron-dense deposit s, while type II (dense depositdisease) is characterised by intramembranous dense deposit s.\\n673CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. By light microscopy,  the\\nsingle most important feature in focal GN is the\\nabnormality seen in certain number of glomeruli andgenerally confined to one or two lobules of the affected\\nglomeruli i.e. focal and segmental glomerular involvement\\n(Fig. 22.21,A) . The pathologic change most frequently\\nconsists of focal and segmental cellular proliferation of\\nmesangial cells and endothelial cells but sometimesnecrotising changes can be seen. The condition must bedistinguished from focal and segmental glomerulo-sclerosis (discussed below).By immunofluorescence microscopy,  widespread\\nmesangial deposits of immunoglobulins (mainly IgA withor without IgG), complement (C3) and fibrin aredemonstrated in most cases of focal GN.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical features vary according\\nto the condition causing it. Haematuria is one of the mostcommon clinical manifestation. Proteinuria is frequently mildto moderate but hypertension is uncommon.\\nFocal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis\\n(Synonyms: Focal Sclerosis, Focal Hyalinosis)\\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a condition in\\nwhich there is sclerosis and hyalinosis of some glomeruli andportions of their tuft (less than 50% in a tissue section), whilethe other glomeruli are normal by light microscopy i.e.involvement is focal and segmental. The incidence of FSGShas increased over the last decades and is currentlyresponsible for about one-third cases of nephrotic syndromein the adults.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  FSGS was previously believed to\\nbe a variant of MCD with accentuation of epithelial damagein the form of hyalinosis and sclerosis. Currently, the\\ncondition is divided into 3 groups:\\ni) Idiopathic type.  This group comprises majority of cases.\\nIt is found in children and young adults with presentation\\nof nephrotic syndrome. It differs from minimal changedisease in having non-selective proteinuria, in being steroid-resistant, and may progress to chronic renal failure. Immuno-fluorescence microscopy reveals deposits of IgM and C3 inthe sclerotic segment.\\nii)\\nWith superimposed primary glomerular disease.  There\\nmay be cases of FSGS with superimposed MCD or IgA\\nnephropathy. Those associated with MCD show goodresponse to steroid therapy and progression to chronic renalfailure may occur after a long time.\\niii)Secondary type.  This group consists of focal segmental\\nsclerotic lesions as a secondary manifestation of certain\\ndiseases such as HIV, diabetes mellitus, reflux nephropathy,heroin abuse and analgesic nephropathy.\\nThe hallmark of pathogenesis of FSGS is injury to visceral\\nepithelial cells that results in disruption of visceral epithelialcells and resultant nephron loss.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. By light microscopy,depending upon the severity of the disease, variablenumber of glomeruli are affected focally and segmentally,while others are normal. The affected glomeruli showsolidification or sclerosis  of one or more lobules of the tuft.\\nHyalinosis  refers to collection of eosinophilic,\\nhomogeneous, PAS-positive, hyaline material present onthe inner aspect of a sclerotic peripheral capillary loop.Mesangial hypercellularity is present in appreciablenumber of cases. In addition, to glomerular changes, thereis interstitial fibrosis and infiltration by mononuclearFigure 22.21 A, Focal GN . The characteristic feature is the cellular proliferation in some glomeruli and in one or two lobules of the affected\\nglomeruli i.e. focal and segment al proliferative change. B, C,  Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis . The features are focal and segment al involvement\\nof the glomeruli by sclerosis and hyalinosis and mesangial hypercellularity .\\n674SECTION III Systemic Pathologyleucocytes, and tubular epithelial cell atrophy and\\ndegeneration (Fig. 22.21,B, C) .\\nBesides the lesions of focal and segmental scarring, a\\nvariant of FSGS, collapsing glomerulopathy , has been\\ndescribed in HIV patients. It is segmental or globalglomerular collapse of the tuft along with the presence ofhyperpasia and hypertrophy of podocytes producing apseudo-crescent and a rapid decline in renal function.\\nBy electron microscopy,  diffuse loss of foot processes\\nas seen in minimal change disease is evident but, inaddition, there are electron-dense deposits in the regionof hyalinosis and sclerosis which are believed to beimmune complexes.\\nBy Immunofluorescence microscopy,  the deposits in the\\nlesions are shown to contain IgM and C3.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The condition may affect all ages\\nincluding children and has male preponderance. The most\\ncommon presentation is in the form of nephrotic syndromewith heavy proteinuria. Haematuria and hypertension tendto occur more frequently than in minimal change disease.Evidence of renal failure may be present at the onset.\\nIgA Nephropathy\\n(Synonyms: Berger ’s Disease, IgA  GN)\\nIgA nephropathy is emerging as the most common form ofglomerulopathy worldwide and its incidence has been rising.It is characterised by aggregates of IgA, deposited principallyin the mesangium. The condition was first described byBerger, a French physician in 1968 (Not to be confused withBuerger’s disease or thromboangiitis obliterans described byan American pathologist in 1908 and discussed on page 404).\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The etiology of IgA nephropathy\\nremains unclear:\\ni) It is idiopathic in most cases.ii) Seen as part of Henoch-Schonlein purpura.iii) Association with chronic inflammation in various bodysystems (e.g. chronic liver disease, inflammatory boweldisease, interstitial pneumonitis, leprosy,  dermatitisherpetiformis, uveitis, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjögren’ssyndrome, monoclonal IgA gammopathy).\\nPathogenesis of IgA nephropathy is explained on the basis\\nof following mechanisms:\\ni) In view of exclusive mesangial deposits of IgA and\\nelevated serum levels of IgA and IgA-immune complexes,\\nIgA nephropathy has been considered to arise fromentrapment  of these complexes in the mesangium.\\nii\\n) There is absence of early components of the complement\\nbut presence of C3 and properdin in the mesangial deposits,which point towards activation of alternate complement\\npathway.\\niii)Since there is close association between mucosal\\ninfections (e.g. of the respiratory, gastrointestinal or urinary\\ntract), it is suggested that IgA deposited in the mesangiumcould be due to increased mucosal secretion of IgA.\\niv) HLA-B35 association has been reported in some cases.Another possibility is genetically-determined abnormality of\\nthe immune system producing an increase in circulating IgA.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. By light microscopy,  the\\npattern of involvement varies. These include: focalproliferative GN, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,membranoproliferative GN, and rarely RPGN.By electron microscopy,  finely granular electron-dense\\ndeposits are seen in the mesangium.By immunofluorescence microscopy,  the diagnosis is\\nfirmly established by demonstration of mesangial depositsof IgA, with or without IgG, and usually with C3 andproperdin.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The disease is common in children\\nand young adults. The clinical picture is usually characterisedby recurrent bouts of haematuria that are often precipitatedby mucosal infections. Mild proteinuria is usually presentand occasionally nephrotic syndrome may develop.\\nChronic Glomerulonephritis\\n(Synonym: End-S tage Kidney)\\nChronic GN is the final stage of a variety of glomerulardiseases which result in irreversible impairment of renalfunction. The conditions which may progress to chronic GN,in descending order of frequency, are as under:\\ni)Rapidly progressive GN (90%)\\nii)\\nMembranous GN (50%)\\niii) Membranoproliferative GN (50%)iv) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (50%)v) IgA nephropathy (40%)\\nvi) Acute post-streptococcal GN (1%).\\nHowever, about 20% cases of chronic GN are idiopathic\\nwithout evidence of preceding GN of any type.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the kidneys are\\nusually small and contracted weighing as low as 50 gm\\neach. The capsule is adherent to the cortex. The corticalsurface is generally diffusely granular  (Fig. 22.22) . On cut\\nsection, the cortex is narrow and atrophic, while themedulla is unremarkable.\\nMicroscopically,  the changes vary greatly depending\\nupon the underlying glomerular disease. In general, the\\nfollowing changes are seen (Fig. 22.23) .\\ni) Glomeruli —Glomeruli are reduced in number and\\nmost of those present show completely hyalinised tufts,giving the appearance of acellular, eosinophilic masseswhich are PAS-positive. Evidence of underlyingglomerular disease may be present.\\nii \\n) Tubules —Many tubules completely disappear and\\nthere may be atrophy of tubules close to scarred glomeruli.\\nTubular cells show hyaline-droplets, degeneration andtubular lumina frequently contain eosinophilic,homogeneous casts.\\niii)Interstitium —There is fine and delicate fibrosis of the\\ninterstitial tissue and varying number of chronic\\ninflammatory cells are often seen.iv) Vessels —Advanced cases which are frequently\\nassociated with hypertension show conspicuous arterialand arteriolar sclerosis.675CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractPatients of end-stage kidney disease on dialysis show\\na variety of dialysis associated changes that include acqui-\\nred cystic disease (page 659), occurrence of adenomas andadenocarcinomas of the kidney, calcification of tufts anddeposition of calcium oxalate crystals in tubules.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The patients are usually adults. The\\nterminal stage of chronic GN is characterised byhypertension, uraemia and progressive deterioration of renalfunction. Besides the primary changes due to chronic renalfailure, there are a variety of systemic manifestations ofuraemia (page 655). These patients eventually die if they donot receive a renal transplant.\\nThe salient features of various types of primary\\nglomerulonephritis are summarised in Table 22.11.\\nII.SECONDARY GLOMERULAR DISEASES\\nGlomerular involvement may occur secondary to certainsystemic diseases or a few hereditary diseases. In some ofthese, renal involvement may be the initial presentation,while in others clinical evidence of renal disease appears longafter other manifestations have appeared. A list of theseconditions has already been given in Table 22.4. The\\nimportant examples are described below.\\nLupus Nephritis\\nRenal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\\nare termed lupus nephritis. Other clinical manifestations,etiology and pathogenesis of this multi-system autoimmunedisease are described in Chapter 4 (page 78). The incidenceof renal involvement in SLE ranges from 40 to 75%. The twocardinal clinical manifestations of lupus nephritis areproteinuria and haematuria. In addition, hypertension andcasts of different types such as red cell casts, fatty casts andleucocyte casts in the urinary sediment are found.\\nPathogenesis of lesions in lupus nephritis is linked to\\ngenes related to major histocompatibility complex and B-cellsignaling pathways such as TNF superfamily members.Figure 22.22 End-stage kidney, gross appearance of short contract kidney in chronic glomerulonephritis. The kidney is small and contracted.\\nThe capsule is adherent to the cortex and has diffusely granular cortical surface.\\nFigure 22.23 End-stage kidney in chronic GN, light microscopy.

Blood vessels in th e\\ninterstitium are hyalinised and thickened while the interstitium shows fine fibrosis and a few chronic inflammatory cells.\\n676SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  According to the WHO,\\nsix patterns of mutually-merging renal lesions are seen in\\nlupus nephritis ( also refer to  Table 4.9 ):\\nClass I: Minimal lesions. On light microscopy, these cases\\ndo not show any abnormality. But examination by electronmicroscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy showsdeposits within the mesangium which consist of IgG andC3.\\nClass II: Mesangial lupus nephritis. These cases have\\nmild clinical manifestations. By light microscopy, there is\\nincrease in the number of mesangial cells and of mesangialmatrix. Ultrastructural and immunofluorescence studiesreveal granular mesangial deposits of IgG and C3; some-times IgA and IgM are also present in the deposits.\\nClass III: Focal segmental lupus nephritis. This is\\ncharacterised by focal and segmental proliferation of\\nendothelial and mesangial cells, together with infiltrationby macrophages and sometimes neutrophils.Haematoxylin bodies of Gross may be present.Subendothelial and subepithelial deposits of IgG, oftenwith IgM or IgA and C3, are seen.\\nClass IV: Diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis. In this\\ntype, all the morphologic manifestations of lupus are\\npresent in most advanced form.

There is\\ndiffuse proliferation of endothelial, mesangial, andsometimes epithelial cells, involving most or all glomeruli.Electron microscopy shows large electron-dense depositsin the mesangium and in the subendothelial region whichon immunofluorescence are positive for IgG; sometimesalso for IgA or IgM, and C3.\\nClass V: Membranous lupus nephritis.  These lesions\\nresemble those of idiopathic membranous GN.

Mesangial hypercellularity ispresent in some cases.\\nClass VI: Sclerosing lupus nephritis.  This is end-stage\\nkidney of SLE, akin to chronic GN. Most glomeruli are\\nsclerosed and hyalinised and there may be remnants ofpreceding lesions.\\nAlthough in a given case, the lesions in lupus nephririts\\nfit into one of the classes described above, it is not unusualto find overlapping and progressive transformation of lupuslesions during the course of disease.\\nDiabetic Nephropathy\\nRenal involvement is an important complication of diabetes\\nmellitus. End-stage kidney with renal failure accounts fordeaths in more than 10% of all diabetics. Renal complicationsare more severe, develop early and more frequently intype 1 (earlier called insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus(30-40% cases) than in type 2 (earlier termed non-insulin-dependent) diabetics  (about 20% cases). A variety of clinicalsyndromes are associated with diabetic nephropathy thatincludes asymptomatic proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome,progressive renal failure and hypertension. Cardiovasculardisease is 40 times more common in patients of end-stagerenal disease in diabetes mellitus than in non-diabetics andmore diabetics die from cardiovascular complications thanfrom uraemia.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Diabetic nephropathy\\nencompasses 4 types of renal lesions in diabetes mellitus:diabetic glomerulosclerosis, vascular lesions, diabeticpyelonephritis and tubular lesions (Armanni-Ebsteinlesions).\\n1.DIABETIC GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS. Glomerular\\nlesions in diabetes mellitus are particularly common and\\naccount for majority of abnormal findings referable to thekidney.\\nPathogenesis of these lesions in diabetes mellitus is\\nexplained by following sequential changes:  hyper-glycaemia → glomerular hypertension → renal hyper-\\nperfusion → deposition of proteins in the mesangium →\\nglomerulosclerosis → renal failure. In addition, cellular\\ninfiltration in renal lesions in diabetic glomerular lesionsis due to growth factors, particularly transforming growthfactor- β. Strict control of blood glucose level and control\\nof systemic hypertension in  these patients retardsprogression to diabetic nephropathy.\\nGlomerulosclerosis in diabetes may take one of the 2\\nforms: diffuse or nodular lesions:i) Diffuse glomerulosclerosis.  Diffuse glomerular\\nlesions are the most common. There is involvement of allparts of glomeruli. The pathologic changes consist of\\nthickening of the GBM and diffuse increase in mesangial\\nmatrix with mild proliferation of mesangial cells. Variousexudative lesions such as capsular hyaline drops and fibrincaps may also be present (Fig. 22.24,A) Capsular drop  is an\\neosinophilic hyaline thickening of the parietal layer ofBowman’s capsule and bulges into the glomerular space.\\nFigure 22.24 Diabetic glomerulosclerosis. A, Diffuse  lesions.  The characteristic features are dif fuse involvement of the glomeruli showing\\nthickening of the GBM and diffuse increase in the mesangial matrix with mild proliferation of mesangial cells and exudative les ions (fibrin caps and\\ncapsular drops). B, Nodular lesion (Kimmelstiel-Wilson Lesion).  There are one or more hyaline nodules within the lobules of glomeruli, surrounded\\nperipherally by glomerular capillaries with thickened walls.\\n678SECTION III Systemic PathologyFibrin cap is homogeneous, brightly eosinophilic material\\nappearing on the wall of a peripheral capillary of a lobule.\\nii) Nodular glomerulosclerosis.  Nodular lesions of\\ndiabetic glomerulosclerosis are also called as Kimmelstiel-\\nWilson (KW) lesions  or intercapillary glomerulosclerosis.\\nThese lesions are specific for type 1 diabetes (juvenile-onset diabetes) or islet cell antibody-positive diabetesmellitus. The pathologic changes consist of one or morenodules in a few or many glomeruli. Nodule  is an ovoid or\\nspherical, laminated, hyaline, acellular mass locatedwithin a lobule of the glomerulus. The nodules aresurrounded peripherally by glomerular capillary loopswhich may have normal or thickened GBM (Fig. 22.24,B) .\\nThe nodules are PAS-positive and contain lipid and fibrin.As the nodular lesions enlarge, they compress the glomer-ular capillaries and obliterate the glomerular tuft(Fig. 22.25) . As a result of glomerular and arteriolar\\ninvolvement, renal ischaemia occurs leading to tubularatrophy and interstitial fibrosis and grossly small,contracted kidney.\\n2.VASCULAR LESIONS.  Atheroma  of renal arteries is\\nvery common and severe in diabetes mellitus. Hyaline\\narteriolosclerosis  (Chapter 15) affecting the afferent and\\nefferent arterioles of the glomeruli is also often severe in\\ndiabetes. These vascular lesions are responsible for renalischaemia that results in tubular atrophy and interstitialfibrosis.\\n3. DIABETIC PYELONEPHRITIS.  Poorly-controlled\\ndiabetics are particularly susceptible to bacterial infec-\\ntions. Papillary necrosis (necrotising papillitis) (page 682)is an important complication of diabetes that may resultin acute pyelonephritis. Chronic pyelonephritis is 10 to20 times more common in diabetics than in others.\\n4.\\nTUBULAR LESIONS (ARMANNI-EBSTEIN\\nLESIONS).  In untreated diabetics who have extremelyhigh blood sugar level, the epithelial cells of the proximal\\nconvoluted tubules develop extensive glycogen depositsappearing as vacuoles. These are called Armanni-Ebsteinlesions. The tubules return to normal on control ofhyperglycaemic state.\\nHereditary Nephritis\\nA group of hereditary diseases principally involving the\\nglomeruli are termed hereditary nephritis. These include thefollowing:1.Alport’s syndrome\\n2. Fabry’s disease3. Nail-patella syndrome\\n1.Alport’s syndrome.  Out of various hereditary nephritis,\\nAlport’s syndrome is relatively more common and has been\\nextensively studied. This is an X-linked dominant disorderhaving mutation in  α−5 chain of type IV collagen located on\\nX-chromosome. It affects males more severely than females.The syndrome consists of sensori-neural deafness andophthalmic complications (lens dislocation, posteriorcataracts and corneal dystrophy) associated with hereditarynephritis. The condition is slowly progressive, terminatingin end-stage kidney in the 2nd to 3rd decades of life. Thecommon presenting features are persistent or recurrenthaematuria accompanied by erythrocyte casts, proteinuriaand hypertension.\\nBy light microscopy,  the glomeruli have predominant\\ninvolvement and show segmental proliferation ofmesangial cells with increased mesangial matrix andoccasional segmental sclerosis. Another prominent featureis the presence of lipid-laden foam cells  in the interstitium.\\nAs the disease progresses, there is increasing sclerosis ofglomeruli, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis.\\nElectron microscopy  reveals characteristic basement\\nmembrane splitting or lamination in the affected parts of\\nglomeruli.\\nImmunofluorescence studies  fail to show deposits of\\nimmunoglobulins or complement components.\\n2\\n. Fabry’s disease,  another hereditary nephritis is\\ncharacterised by accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids\\nin lysosomes of glomerular, tubular, vascular and interstitialcells.\\n3. Nail-patella syndrome  or osteonychodysplasia is a rare\\nhereditary disease having abnormality in  α-1 chain of\\ncollagen V on chromosome 9 associated with multiple\\nosseous defects of elbows, knees and nail dysplasia. Abouthalf the cases develop nephropathy.\\nTUBULAR AND TUBULOINTERSTITIAL DISEASES\\nIt is difficult to separate the involvement of the tubules and\\nthe interstitium since most forms of tubular diseases alsoinvolve the interstitium, while the tubules and interstitiummay be involved secondarily as a part of the diseases of otherrenal components. For the purpose of present discussion, thisgroup of diseases is discussed under 2 headings:Figure 22.25 Diabetic nephropathy—nodular (Kimmelstiel-W ilson\\nor KW) lesions.\\n679CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractI. Primary tubular diseases  that include tubular injury by\\nischaemic or toxic agents i.e. acute tubular necrosis.\\nII. Tubulointerstitial diseases  that include inflammatory\\ninvolvement of the tubules and the interstitium i.e.\\ntubulointerstitial nephritis.\\nACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS\\nAcute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the term used for acute renal\\nfailure (ARF) resulting from destruction of tubular epithe-lial cells. ATN is the most common and most important causeof ARF characterised by sudden cessation of renal function.Various other causes of ARF (pre-renal, intra-renal and post-renal) as well as the clinical syndrome accompanying ATN(oliguric phase, diuretic phase and phase of recovery) aredescribed already on page 654. Based on etiology andmorphology, two forms of ATN are distinguished—ischaemic and toxic; however both forms have a somewhatcommon pathogenesis.\\nPathogenesis of ATN\\nThe pathogenesis of both types of ATN resulting in ARF is\\nexplained on the basis of the following sequential mechanismand is illustrated in Fig. 22.26 :\\ni) Renal tubules are highly susceptible to injury by ischaemia\\nand toxic agents.\\nii)Tubular damage  in ischaemic ATN is initiated by arteriolar\\nvasoconstriction induced by renin-angiotensin system, while\\nin toxic ATN by direct damage to tubules by the agent.\\niii) Debris of the desquamated epithelium due to necrosis\\ncauses  tubular obstruction  and may block urinary outflow with\\nconsequent reduction of GFR and also produce casts in theurine.\\niv)These events cause increased intratubular pressure  resulting\\nin damage to tubular basement membrane.v)\\nDue to increased intratubular pressure, there is tubular\\nrupture .\\nvi) Damage to tubules is accompanied with leakage of fluid\\ninto the interstitium causing interstitial oedema .\\nvii)Leakage of tubular fluid into the interstitium increasesinterstitial pressure .\\nviii) Leaked fluid incites host inflammatory response .\\nix) Increased interstitial pressure causes compression  of tubules\\nand blood vessels  and setting up a vicious cycle of accentuated\\nischaemia and necrosis.\\nx) Ultimately, it leads to reduced GFR and consequently\\noliguria.\\nIschaemic ATN\\nIschaemic ATN, also called tubulorrhectic ATN, lower\\n(distal) nephron nephrosis, anoxic nephrosis, or shockkidney, occurs due to hypoperfusion of the kidneys resultingin focal damage to the distal parts of the convoluted tubules.\\nETIOLOGY.  Ischaemic ATN is more common than toxic\\nATN and accounts for more than 80% cases of tubular injury.\\nIschaemia may result from a variety of causes as follows:1. Shock (post-traumatic, surgical, burns, dehydration,\\nobstetrical and septic type).\\n2. Crush injuries.3.\\nNon-traumatic rhabdomyolysis induced by alcohol,\\ncoma, muscle disease or extreme muscular exertion\\n(myoglobinuric nephrosis).\\n4. Mismatched blood transfusions, black-water fever\\n(haemoglobinuric nephrosis).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the kidneys are\\nenlarged and swollen. On cut section, the cortex is oftenwidened and pale, while medulla is dark.\\nHistologically, predominant changes are seen in the\\ntubules, while glomeruli remain unaffected. Theinterstitium shows oedema and mild chronicinflammatory cell infiltrate. Tubular changes are as follows(Fig. 22.27) :\\n1. Dilatation of the proximal and distal convoluted\\ntubules.2. Focal tubular necrosis at different points along thenephron.3.\\nFlattened epithelium lining the tubules suggesting\\nepithelial regeneration.4. Eosinophilic hyaline casts or pigmented haemoglobinand myoglobin casts in the tubular lumina  (Fig. 22.28) .\\n5.Disruption of tubular basement membrane adjacent\\nto the cast may occur (tubulorrhexis).Figure 22.26 Pathogenesis of ATN.\\n680SECTION III Systemic PathologyPrognosis  of ischaemic ATN depends upon the underlying\\netiology. In general, cases that follow severe trauma, surgical\\nprocedures, extensive burns and sepsis have much worseoutlook than the others.\\nToxic ATN\\nToxic ATN, also called nephrotoxic ATN or toxic nephrosis\\nor upper (proximal) nephron nephrosis,  occurs as a resultof direct damage to tubules, more marked in proximalportions, by ingestion, injection or inhalation of a number oftoxic agents.ETIOLOGY.  The toxic agents causing toxic ATN are as\\nunder:\\n1. General poisons such as mercuric chloride, carbon\\ntetrachloride, ethylene glycol, mushroom poisoning and\\ninsecticides.\\n2. Heavy metals (mercury, lead, arsenic, phosphorus and\\ngold).\\n3. Drugs such as sulfonamides, certain antibiotics (genta-\\nmycin, cephalosporin), anaesthetic agents (methoxyflurane,halothane), barbiturates, salicylates.\\n4.Radiographic contrast material.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Poisoning with mercuric\\nchloride provides the classic example that produces\\nwidespread and readily discernible tubular necrosis (acute\\nmercury nephropathy).Grossly,  the kidneys are enlarged and swollen. On cut\\nsection, the cortex is pale and swollen, while the medullais slightly darker than normal.Histologically,  the appearance varies according to the\\ncause of toxic ATN but, in general, involves the segmentof tubule diffusely (unlike ischaemic ATN where theinvolvement of nephron is focal). In mercuric chloridepoisoning, the features are as follows (Fig. 22.28) :\\n1.\\nEpithelial cells of mainly proximal convoluted tubules\\nare necrotic and desquamated into the tubular lumina.2. The desquamated cells may undergo dystrophiccalcification.3. Tubular basement membrane is generally intact.\\n4.\\nThe regenerating epithelium, which is flat and thin\\nwith few mitoses, may be seen lining the tubular basementmembrane.\\nPrognosis  of toxic ATN is good if there is no serious\\ndamage to other organs such as heart and liver.\\nThe contrasting features of the two forms of ATN are\\npresented in Table 22.12.\\nTUBULOINTERSTITIAL DISEASES\\nThe term tubulointerstitial nephritis is used for inflammatory\\nprocess that predominantly involves the renal interstitialtissue and is usually accompanied by some degree of tubulardamage. A number of primary glomerular, tubular, vascularand obstructive diseases are secondarily associated withinterstitial reaction. However, the term interstitial nephritis  is\\nreserved for those cases where there is no primaryinvolvement of glomeruli, tubules or blood vessels. The oldernomenclature, interstitial nephritis, is currently used syno-nymously with tubulointerstitial nephritis or tubulointerstitial\\nnephropathy.\\nA number of bacterial and non-bacterial, acute and\\nchronic conditions may produce tubulointerstitial nephritisand are listed in Table 22.13. The important and common\\nexamples among these are discussed below.\\nAcute Pyelonephritis\\nAcute pyelonephritis is an acute suppurative inflammation\\nof the kidney caused by pyogenic bacteria.Figure 22.27 Ischaemic ATN. There is focal necrosis along the\\nnephron involving proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) as well as distal\\nconvoluted tubule (DCT). The affected tubules are dilated, their luminacontain casts (hyaline or pigmented haem) and the affected regions arelined by regenerating thin and flat epithelium.\\nFigure 22.28\\nToxic ATN. There is extensive necrosis of epithelial\\ncells involving predominantly proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) dif fusely.\\nThe necrosed cells are desquamated into the tubular lumina and may\\nundergo dystrophic calcification. The tubular lumina cont ain casts(granular) and the regenerating flat epithelium lines the necrosed tubule.\\n681CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Most cases of acute pyelonephritis\\nfollow infection of the lower urinary tract. The most\\ncommon pathogenic organism in urinary tract infection(UTI) is  Escherichia coli  (in 90% of cases), followed in\\ndecreasing frequency, by Enterobacter, Klebsiella,\\nPseudomonas  and Proteus.  The bacteria gain entry into the\\nurinary tract, and thence into the kidney by one of the tworoutes: ascending infection and haematogenous infection(Fig. 22.29) :\\n1.Ascending infection.  This is the most common route of\\ninfection. The common pathogenic organisms are inhabitantsof the colon and may cause faecal contamination of theurethral orifice, especially in females in reproductive agegroup. This has been variously attributed to shorter urethrain females liable to faecal contamination, hormonal influencesfacilitating bacterial adherence to the mucosa, absence ofprostatic secretions which have antibacterial properties, andurethral trauma during sexual intercourse. The last namedproduces what is appropriately labelled as ‘honeymoon\\npyelitis’. Ascending infection may occur in a normal indi-\\nvidual but the susceptibility is increased in patients withdiabetes mellitus, pregnancy, urinary tract obstruction orinstrumentation. Bacteria multiply in the urinary bladder andproduce asymptomatic bacteriuria found in many of thesecases. After having caused urethritis and cystitis, the bacteriain susceptible cases ascend further up into the ureters againstthe flow of urine, extend into the renal pelvis and then therenal cortex. The role of vesico-ureteral reflux is not of a greatsignificance in the pathogenesis of acute chronic pyelo-nephritis as it is in chronic pyelonephritis.\\n2. Haematogenous infection.  Less often, acute pyelo-\\nnephritis may result from blood-borne spread of infection.\\nThis occurs more often in patients with obstructive lesions\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.12.

Grossly,  well-developed\\ncases of acute pyelonephritis show enlarged and swollenkidney that bulges on section. The cut surface shows small,yellow-white abscesses with a haemorrhagic rim. Theseabscesses may be several millimetres across and aresituated mainly in the cortex.Microscopically,  acute pyelonephritis is characterised by\\nextensive acute inflammation involving the interstitiumand causing destruction of the tubules. Generally, theglomeruli and renal blood vessels show considerableresistance to infection and are spared. The acuteinflammation may be in the form of large number ofneutrophils in the interstitial tissue and bursting intotubules, or may form focal neutrophilic abscesses in therenal parenchyma.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Classically, acute pyelonephritis has\\nan acute onset with chills, fever, loin pain, lumbar tenderness,dysuria and frequency of micturition. Urine will showbacteria in excess of 100,000/ml, pus cells and pus cell castsin the urinary sediment. Institution of specific antibiotics,after identification of bacteria by culture followed bysensitivity test, eradicates the infection in majority of patients.\\nCOMPLICATIONS.  Complications of acute pyelonephritis\\nare encountered more often in patients with diabetes mellitus\\nor with urinary tract obstruction. Following are the threeimportant complications of acute pyelonephritis:\\n1. Papillary necrosis.  Papillary necrosis or necrotising\\npapillitis develops more commonly in analgesic abuse\\nnephropathy and in sickle cell disease but may occur as acomplication of acute pyelonephritis as well. It may affectone or both kidneys.\\nGrossly,  the necrotic papillae are yellow to grey-white,\\nsharply-defined areas with congested border and resembleinfarction. The pelvis may be dilated.Microscopically,  necrotic tissue is separated from the\\nviable tissue by a dense zone of polymorphs. The necroticarea shows characteristic coagulative necrosis as seen inrenal infarcts.\\n2.\\nPyonephrosis.  Rarely, the abscesses in the kidney in\\nacute pyelonephritis are extensive, particularly in cases withobstruction. This results in inability of the abscesses to drainand this transforms the kidney into a multilocular sacfilled with pus called as pyonephrosis or renal carbuncle\\n(Fig. 22.30) .\\n3.Perinephric abscess.  The abscesses in the kidney may\\nextend through the capsule of the kidney into the perinephric\\ntissue and form perinephric abscess.\\nChronic Pyelonephritis\\nChronic pyelonephritis is a chronic tubulointerstitial disease\\nresulting from repeated attacks of inflammation and scarring.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Depending upon the etiology and\\npathogenesis, two types of chronic pyelonephritis are descri-bed—reflux nephropathy and obstructive pyelonephritis\\n(Fig. 22.31) :\\n1.\\nReflux nephropathy.  Reflux of urine from the bladder\\ninto one or both the ureters during micturition is the major\\ncause of chronic pyelonephritis. Vesicoureteric reflux  is\\nparticularly common in children, especially in girls, due tocongenital absence or shortening of the intravesical portionof the ureter so that ureter is not compressed during the act\\nof micturition. Reflux results in increase in pressure in the\\nrenal pelvis so that the urine is forced into renal tubules whichis eventually followed by damage to the kidney and scarformation (Fig. 22.29) . Vesicoureteric reflux is more common\\nin patients with urinary tract infection, whether symptomaticor asymptomatic, but reflux of sterile urine can also cause\\nrenal damage.\\n2. Obstructive pyelonephritis.  Obstruction to the outflow\\nof urine at different levels predisposes the kidney to infection\\n(page 690). Recurrent episodes of such obstruction and\\ninfection result in renal damage and scarring. Rarely,recurrent attacks of acute pyelonephritis may cause renaldamage and scarring.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the kidneys show\\nrather characteristic appearance. The kidneys are usuallysmall and contracted (weighing less than 100 gm) showingunequal reduction, which distinguishes it from otherforms of contracted kidney. The surface of the kidney isirregularly scarred; the capsule can be stripped off withdifficulty due to adherence to scars. These scars are of\\nvariable size and show characteristic U-shaped\\ndepressions on the cortical surface. There is generallyblunting and dilatation of calyces ( calyectasis ) and dilated\\npelvis of the kidney (Fig. 22.32) .\\nMicroscopically,  predominant changes are seen in\\ninterstitium and (Fig. 22.33) :\\nFigure 22.30 Pyonephrosis. The kidney is enlarged and has\\nincreased perinephric fat in the hilum. Sectioned surface shows markedly\\ndilated pelvis and calyces having irregular and ragged inner surface andcontaining necrotic debris and pus.683CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tracti) Interstitium —There is chronic interstitial inflam-\\nmatory reaction, chiefly composed of lymphocytes,\\nplasma cells and macrophages with pronouncedinterstitial fibrosis. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis  is\\nan uncommon variant characterised by collection of foamymacrophages admixed with other inflammatory cells andgiant cells.ii) Tubules —The tubules show varying degree of\\natrophy and dilatation. Dilated tubules may containeosinophilic colloid casts producing thyroidisation oftubules. A few tubules may contain neutrophils.iii)Pelvicalyceal system —The renal pelvis and calyces\\nare dilated. The walls of pelvis and calyces show markedchronic inflammation and fibrosis. Lymphoid follicleswith germinal centres may be present in the pelvicalycealwalls. The lining epithelium may undergo squamousmetaplastic change.iv) Blood vessels —Blood vessels entrapped in the scarred\\nareas show obliterative endarteritis. There may be changesof hypertensive hyaline arteriolosclerosis.v) Glomeruli —Though glomerular tuft in the scarred\\narea is usually intact, there is often periglomerular fibrosis.Figure 22.31 The two major types of mechanisms in chronic pyelonephritis.

Chronic pyelonephritis often has\\nan insidious onset. The patients present with clinical pictureof chronic renal failure or with symptoms of hypertension.Sometimes, the patients may present with features of acuterecurrent pyelonephritis with fever, loin pain, lumbartenderness, dysuria, pyouria, bacteriuria and frequency ofmicturition. Diagnosis is made by intravenous pyelography(IVP). Culture of the urine may give positive results.Longstanding cases of chronic pyelonephritis may developsecondary systemic amyloidosis.\\nTuberculous Pyelonephritis\\nTuberculosis of the kidney occurs due to haematogenous\\nspread of infection from another site, most often from thelungs. Less commonly, it may result from ascending infectionfrom tuberculosis of the genitourinary system such as fromepididymis or Fallopian tubes. The renal lesions intuberculosis may be in the form of tuberculous pyelonephritisor appear as multiple miliary tubercles.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the lesions in\\ntuberculous pyelonephritis are often bilateral, usuallyinvolving the medulla with replacement of the papillaeby caseous tissue. Obstruction may result in tuberculouspyonephrosis in which thinned out renal parenchymasurrounds dilated pelvis and calyces filled with caseousmaterial.Histologically,  typical granulomatous reaction is seen.\\nAcid-fast bacilli can often be demonstrated in the lesions.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Most patients are young to middle-\\naged adults. The clinical presentation is extremely variablebut it should always be considered as a possibility in a patientin whom there is persistent sterile pyouria, microscopichaematuria and mild proteinuria after effective antibiotictherapy for urinary tract infection. The diagnosis rests onidentification of M. tuberculosis  by repeated culture of urine\\non L.J. media.\\nMyeloma Nephropathy\\nRenal involvement in multiple myeloma (Chapter 14) is\\nreferred to as myeloma nephropathy or myeloma kidney.Functional renal impairment in multiple myeloma is acommon manifestation, developing in about 50% of patients.The pathogenesis of myeloma kidney is related to excessfiltration of Bence Jones proteins through the glomerulus,usually kappa  (\\nκ) light chains. These light chain proteins are\\nprecipitated in the distal convoluted tubules in combinationwith Tamm-Horsfall proteins, the urinary glycoproteins. Theprecipitates form tubular casts which are eosinophilic andoften laminated. These casts may induce peritubular inter-stitial inflammatory reaction. Not all light chains arenephrotoxic and their toxicity occurs under acidic pH of thetubular fluid.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the kidneys may\\nbe normal or small and shrunken.Histologically,  there are some areas of tubular atrophy\\nwhile many other tubular lumina are dilated and containcharacteristic bright pink laminated cracked or fracturedcasts consisting of Bence-Jones proteins called fracturedcasts. These casts are surrounded by peritubularinterstitial inflammatory reaction including the presenceof nonspecific inflammatory cells and some multinucleategiant cells induced by tubular casts.\\nNephrocalcinosis\\nNephrocalcinosis is a diffuse deposition of calcium salts in\\nrenal tissue in a number of renal diseases, in hypercalcaemia,Figure 22.33 Chronic pyelonephritis. The scarred area shows atrophy of some tubules and dilat ation of others which contain colloid cast s\\n(thyroidisation). The tubules are surrounded by abundant fibrous tissue and chronic interstitial inflammatory reaction. The blo od vessels included\\nare thick-walled and the glomeruli show periglomerular fibrosis.\\n685CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tracthyperphosphataemia and renal tubular acidosis. Most\\ncommonly, it develops as a complication of severehypercalcaemia such as due to hyperparathyroidism,hypervitaminosis D, excessive bone destruction in metastaticmalignancy, hyperthyroidism, excessive calcium intake suchas in milk-alkali syndrome and sarcoidosis (page 53).Clinically, patients of hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosismay have renal colic, band keratopathy due to calciumdeposits in the cornea, visceral metastatic calcification,polyuria and renal failure.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Nephrocalcinosis due to\\nhypercalcaemia characteristically shows deposition ofcalcium in the tubular epithelial cells in the basementmembrane, within the mitochondria and in the cytoplasm.These concretions may produce secondary tubular atro-phy, interstitial fibrosis and nonspecific chronic inflamm-ation in the interstitium. As the calcification occursintracellularly, radiological evidence is usually not presentuntil fairly late in the disease. The calcium deposits arefirst visible as small opacities in the renal papillae.\\nRENAL VASCULAR DISEASES\\nRenal blood vessels which enormously perfuse the kidney\\nare affected secondarily in majority of renal diseases. Renalblood flow is controlled by systemic and local haemo-dynamic, hormonal and intrinsic intra-renal mechanisms.Diseases which disturb these controlling mechanisms giverise to primary renal vascular lesions. These diseases are asunder:\\nI.Most importantly, hypertensive vascular disease  and its\\nconsequent renal manifestations in the form of benign and\\nmalignant nephrosclerosis.\\nII.Thrombotic microangiopathy .\\nIII.Renal cortical necrosis .\\nIV.Renal infarcts.\\nRenal infarcts are already described in Chapter 5; other\\nconditions are discussed here.\\nHYPERTENSIVE  VASCULAR DISEASE\\nAn elevated arterial blood pressure is a major health problem,\\nparticularly in developed countries. A persistent andsustained high blood pressure has damaging effects on theheart (e.g. hypertensive heart disease, Chapter 16), brain (e.g.cerebrovascular accident or stroke, Chapter 30) and kidneys(benign and malignant nephrosclerosis).\\nDefinition and Classification\\nHypertension is a common disease in industrialised  count-\\nries and accounts for 6% of death worldwide. Epidemiologic\\nstudies have revea led that with elevation in systolic and\\ndiastolic blood pressure above normal in adults, there is acontinuous increased risk of cardiovascular disease, strokeand renal disease—cardiovascular risk doubles with every20 mmHg increase in systolic and 10 mmHg increase indiastolic blood pressure above normal levels. Recently,criteria for normal blood pressure, prehypertension and\\nhypertension (stage 1 and stage 2) have been laid by the\\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH), US (Table 22.14) .\\nAccording to this criteria, normal cut-off values for systolicand diastolic blood pressure are taken as < 120 and < 80mmHg respectively.  As per this criteria, arterial or systemichypertension in adults is defined clinically as persistentlyelevated systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mmHg, ordiastolic pressure of 90-99 mmHg as stage 1 hypertension ,\\nand corresponding values above 160 or above 100 mmHgas stage 2  hypertension.  Cases falling between upper normal\\nvalues for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (i.e. above120/80 mmHg) and those for stage 1 hypertension (120-139/80-89 mmHg) are grouped under \\nprehypertension\\nrequiring monitoring anf follow-up. The diastolic pressureis often considered more significant. Since blood pressurevaries with many factors such as age of the patient, exercise,emotional disturbances like fear and anxiety, it is importantto measure blood pressure at least twice during twoseparate examinations under least stressful conditions.\\nHypertension is generally classified into 2 types:\\n1.Primary or essential hypertension  in which the cause of\\nincrease in blood pressure is unknown. Essentialhypertension constitutes about 80-95% patients ofhypertension.\\n2. Secondary hypertension,  in which the increase in blood\\npressure is caused by diseases of the kidneys, endocrines or\\nsome other organs. Secondary hypertension comprisesremaining 5-20% cases of hypertension.\\nAccording to the clinical course, both essential and\\nsecondary hypertension may be benign or malignant.\\nBenign hypertension  is moderate elevation of blood\\npressure and the rise is slow over the years. About 90-95%patients of hypertension have benign hypertension.\\nMalignant hypertension  is marked and suden increase\\nof blood pressure to 200/140 mmHg or more in a knowncase of hypertension or in a previously normotensiveindividual; the patients develop papilloedema, retinalhaemorrhages and hypertensive encephalopathy. Less than5% of hypertensive patients develop malignant hypertensionand life expectancy after diagnosis in these patients isgenerally less than 2 years if not treated effectively.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.14: Clinical Classification of Hypertension*.\\nCategory Systolic Diastolic\\n(mmHg) (mmHg)\\nNormal < 120 and < 80\\nPrehypertension 120-139 or 80-89\\nHypertension\\n  Stege 1 140-159 or \\n90-99\\n  Stege 2 >160 or >100\\n Isolated systolic hypertension >140 and < 90\\nMalignant hypertension    > 200 > 140\\n(sudden onset) (sudden onset)\\n*Chobanian et al, JAMA,  2003.686SECTION III Systemic PathologyEtiology and Pathogenesis\\nThe etiology and pathogenesis of secondary hypertension\\nthat comprises less than 10% cases has been betterunderstood, whereas the mechanism of essentialhypertension that constitutes about 90% of cases remainslargely obscure. In general, normal blood pressure isregulated by 2 haemodynamic forces —cardiac output  and total\\nperipheral vascular resistance. Factors which alter these two\\nfactors result in hypertension. The role of kidney inhypertension, particularly in secondary hypertension, byelaboration of renin and subsequent formation of angiotensinII, is well established (renin-angiotensin system).\\nWith this background knowledge, we next turn to the\\nmechanisms involved in the two forms of hypertension(Table 22.15).\\nESSENTIAL (PRIMARY) HYPERTENSION.  By definition,\\nthe cause of essential hypertension is unknown but a number\\nof factors are related to its development. These are as under:\\n1.Genetic factors.  The role of heredity in the etiology of\\nessential hypertension has long been suspected. The\\nevidences in support are the familial aggregation, occurrenceof hypertension in twins, epidemiologic data, experimentalanimal studies and identification of hypertensionsusceptibility gene (angiotensinogen gene).\\n2. Racial and environmental factors.  Surveys in the US\\nhave revealed higher incidence of essential hypertension in\\nAfrican Americans than in whites. A number of environ-mental factors have been implicated in the development ofhypertension including salt intake, obesity, skilledoccupation, higher living standards and individuals underhigh stress.\\n3.Risk factors modifying the course of essential hyper-\\ntension.  There is sufficient evidence to show that the course\\nof essential hypertension that begins in middle life is\\nmodified by a number of factors. These are as under:\\ni\\n) Age.  Younger the age at which hypertension is first noted\\nbut left untreated, lower the life expectancy.\\nii) Sex.  Females with hypertension appear to do better than\\nmales.\\niii)Atherosclerosis.  Accelerated atherosclerosis invariably\\naccompanies essential hypertension. This could be due tocontributory role of other independent factors like cigarette\\nsmoking, elevated serum cholesterol, glucose intolerance andobesity.\\niv) Other risk factors.  Other factors which alter the prognosis\\nin hypertension include: smoking, excess of alcohol intake,\\ndiabetes mellitus, persistently high diastolic pressure abovenormal and evidence of end-organ damage (i.e. heart, eyes,kidney and nervous system).\\nThe pathogenetic mechanism  in essential hypertension is\\nexplained by many theories. These are as under:\\n1.High plasma level of catecholamines.\\n2.Increase in blood volume  i.e. arterial overfilling (volume\\nhypertension) and arteriolar constriction (vasoconstrictor\\nhypertension).\\n3.Increased cardiac output.\\n4.Low-renin essential hypertension  found in approximately\\n20% patients due to altered responsiveness to renin release.5.High renin essential hypertension  seen in about 15% cases\\ndue to decreased adrenal responsiveness to angiotensin II.\\nSECONDARY HYPERTENSION.  Though much less\\ncommon than essential hypertension, mechanisms under-\\nlying secondary hypertension with identifiable cause havebeen studied more extensively. Based on the etiology, theseare described under four headings: renal hypertension,endocrine hypertension, hypertension associated withcoarctation of aorta and neurogenic causes.\\n1. RENAL HYPERTENSION.  Hypertension produced by\\nrenal diseases is called renal hypertension. Renal\\nhypertension is subdivided into 2 groups:\\ni) Renal vascular hypertension  e.g. in occlusion of a major\\nrenal artery, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, polyarteritis nodosa\\nand fibromuscular dysplasia of renal artery.\\nii\\n) Renal parenchymal hypertension  e.g. in various types of\\nglomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis,\\ndiabetic nephropathy, amyloidosis, polycystic kidney diseaseand renin-producing tumours.\\nIn either case, renal hypertension can be produced by\\none of the following 3 inter-related pathogenetic mechanisms:\\na) Activation of renin-angiotensin system.  Renin is a\\nproteolytic enzyme produced and stored in the granules of\\nthe juxtaglomerular cells surrounding the afferent arteriolesof glomerulus (page 651). The release of renin is stimulatedby renal ischaemia, sympathetic nervous system stimulation,depressed sodium concentration, fluid depletion anddecreased potassium intake. Released renin is transportedthrough blood stream to the liver where it acts upon substrateangiotensinogen, an α\\n2-globulin synthesised in the liver, to\\nform angiotensin I, a decapeptide. Angiotensin I is convertedinto angiotensin II, an octapeptide, by the action of convertasein the lungs. Angiotensin II is the most potent naturally-occurring vasoconstrictor substance and its pressor action ismainly attributed to peripheral arteriolar vasoconstriction.The other main effect of angiotensin II is to stimulate theadrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone that promotesreabsorption of sodium and water.\\nThus, the renin-angiotensin system is concerned mainly\\nwith 3 functions:\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.15: Etiologic Classification of Hypertension.\\nA.

Blood volume and cardiac\\noutput, both of which have a bearing on blood pressure, are\\nregulated by blood levels of sodium which is significant formaintaining extracellular fluid volume. Blood concentrationof sodium is regulated by 3 mechanisms:\\ni)Release of aldosterone  from activation of renin-angiotensin\\nsystem, as already explained.ii)Reduction in GFR  due to reduced blood flow as occurs in\\nreduced renal mass or renal artery stenosis. This results in\\nproximal tubular reabsorption of sodium.\\niii)Release of atriopeptin hormone  from atria of the heart in\\nresponse to volume expansion. These peptides cause\\nincreased GFR and inhibit sodium reabsorption.\\nc) Release of vasodepressor material.  A number of vaso-\\ndepressor materials and antihypertensives counterbalance\\nthe vasopressor effect of angiotensin II. These substancesinclude: prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2, PGA or medullin)released from interstitial cells of the medulla, urinary\\nkallikrein-kinin syste m and platelet-activating factor.2\\n. ENDOCRINE HYPERTENSION.  A number of hormonal\\nsecretions may produce secondary hypertension. These are:\\ni)Adrenal gland —e.g. in primary aldosteronism, Cushing’s\\nsyndrome, adrenal virilism and pheochromocytoma.\\nii)Parathyroid gland —e.g. hypercalcaemia in hyperpara-\\nthyroidism.iii)Oral contraceptives —Oestrogen component in the oral\\ncontraceptives stimulates hepatic synthesis of renin substrate.\\n3. COARCTATION OF AORTA.  Coarctation of the aorta\\ncauses systolic hypertension in the upper part of the body\\ndue to constriction itself (Chapter 15). Diastolic hypertensionresults from changes in circulation.\\n4. NEUROGENIC.  Psychogenic, polyneuritis, increased\\nintracranial pressure and section of spinal cord are all\\nuncommon causes of secondary hypertension.\\nEFFECTS OF HYPERTENSION\\nSystemic hypertension causes major effects in three main\\norgans—heart and its blood vessels, nervous system, andkidneys. The renal effects in the form of benign and malignantnephrosclerosis are discussed below, whereas hypertensiveeffects on other organs are described elsewhere in therespective chapters. An important and early clinical markerfor renal injury from hypertension and risk factor forcardiovascular disease is macroalbuminuria  (i.e. albuminuria\\n> 150 mg/day or random urine albumin/creatinine ratio of>300 mg/gm creatinine), or microalbuminuria  estimated by\\nradioimmunoassay (i.e. microalbumin 30-300 mg/day orrandom urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio of30-300 mg/gm creatinine).\\nBenign Nephrosclerosis\\nBenign nephrosclerosis is the term used to describe the\\nkidney of benign phase of hypertension. Mild benignnephrosclerosis is the most common form of renal disease inpersons over 60 years of age but its severity increases in thepresence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  both the kidneys\\nare affected equally and are reduced in size and weight,often weighing about 100 gm or less. The capsule is oftenadherent to the cortical surface. The surface of the kidneyis finely granular and shows V-shaped areas of scarring.*The cut surface shows firm kidney and narrowed cortex(Fig. 22.35) .\\nMicroscopically,  there are primarily diffuse vascular\\nchanges which produce parenchymal changes secondarily\\nFigure 22.34 The renin-angiotensin mechanism.\\n*The various acquired causes of ‘small contracted kidney’  and their\\ncharacteristic gross macroscopic appearance may be recollected here.\\nThese are: 1. Chronic GN (granular appearance); 2. Chronic pyelonephritis\\n(U-shaped scars); and 3. Benign nephrosclerosis (V-shaped scars).\\nAlthough granular, U- and V-shaped scars correspond to the respectivemacroscopic patterns, acronym to remember is: ‘granular’ for glomerular\\nscars of chronic GN; ‘U-scars’  for uneven scars of chronic pyelonephritis;\\nand ‘V-scars’  for vascular scars of benign nephrosclerosis. Less common\\ncauses are: amyloidosis of the kidney, myeloma kidney and diabetic\\nnephropathy.\\n688SECTION III Systemic Pathologyas a result of ischaemia. The histologic changes are, thus,\\ndescribed as vascular and parenchymal (Fig. 22.36,A) :\\ni) Vascular changes:  Changes in blood vessels involve\\narterioles and arteries up to the size of arcuate arteries.There are 2 types of changes in these blood vessels:a)Hyaline arteriolosclerosis  that results in homogeneous\\nand eosinophilic thickening of the wall of small bloodvessels.b)lntimal thickening  due to proliferation of smooth muscle\\ncells in the intima.\\nii) Parenchymal changes:  As a consequence of ischaemia,\\nthere is variable degree of atrophy of parenchyma. This\\nincludes: glomerular shrinkage, deposition of collagen inBowman’s space, periglomerular fibrosis, tubular atrophyand fine interstitial fibrosis.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  There is variable elevation of the\\nblood pressure with headache, dizziness, palpitation andnervousness. Eye ground changes may be found butpapilloedema is absent. Renal function tests and urineexamination are normal in early stage. In long-standing cases,there may be mild proteinuria with some hyaline or granularcasts. Rarely, renal failure and uraemia may occur.\\nMalignant Nephrosclerosis\\nMalignant nephrosclerosis is the form of renal disease that\\noccurs in malignant or accelerated hypertension. Malignantnephrosclerosis is uncommon and usually occurs as asuperimposed complication in 5% cases of pre-existingbenign essential hypertension or in those having secondaryhypertension with identifiable cause such as in chronic renaldiseases. However, the pure form of disease also occurs,particularly at younger age with preponderance in males.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the appearance\\nof the kidney varies. In a case of malignant hypertensionsuperimposed on pre-existing benign nephrosclerosis, thekidneys are small in size, shrunken and reduced in weightand have finely granular surface. However, the kidneysof a patient who develops malignant hypertension in pureform are enlarged, oedematous and have petechialhaemorrhages on the surface producing so called ‘flea-\\nbitten kidney’ .* Cut surface shows red and yellow mottled\\nappearance (Fig. 22.37) .\\nMicroscopically,  most commonly the changes are\\nsuperimposed on benign nephrosclerosis. These changesare as under (Fig. 22.36,B) :\\ni) Vascular changes:  These are more severe and involve\\nthe arterioles. The two characteristic vascular changes seenare as under:a)Necrotising arteriolitis  develops on hyaline arterio-\\nlosclerosis. The vessel wall shows fibrinoid necrosis, a fewacute inflammatory cells and small haemorrhages.b)Hyperplastic intimal sclerosis  or onionskin proliferation  is\\ncharacterised by concentric laminae of proliferated smoothmuscle cells, collagen and basement membranes.ii)Ischaemic changes:  The effects of vascular narrowing\\non the parenchyma include tubular loss, fine interstitialfibrosis and foci of infarction necrosis.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The patients of malignant\\nnephrosclerosis have malignant or accelerated hypertensionwith blood pressure of 200/140 mmHg or higher. Headache,dizziness and impaired vision are commonly found. Thepresence of papilloedema distinguishes malignant frombenign phase of hypertension. The urine frequently showshaematuria and proteinuria. Renal function tests showdeterioration during the course of the illness. Azotaemia(high BUN and serum creatinine) and uraemia develop soonif malignant hypertension is not treated aggressively.Approximately 90% of patients die within one year fromcauses such as uraemia, congestive heart failure andcerebrovascular accidents.\\n*Recall the other causes of flea-bitten kidney:  acute post-streptococcal GN,\\nrapidly progressive GN, haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, thrombotic\\nthrombocytopenic purpura and Henoch-Schonlein purpura.\\nFigure 22.35 Small, contracted kidney in chronic hypertension\\n(benign nephrosclerosis).

The medulla, the juxtamedullary cortexand a rim of cortex under the capsule are usually spared.The condition develops most commonly as an obstetricalemergency (e.g. in eclampsia, pre-eclampsia, prematureseparation of the placenta). Other causes include septic shock,poisoning, severe trauma etc.\\nThe lesions may be present focally, patchily or diffusely.\\nThe gross and microscopic characteristics of infarcts of cortexare present. Patients present with sudden oliguria or anuriaand haematuria. If the process has involved renal cortexextensively, acute renal failure and uraemia develop andprognosis is grave.\\nOBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHY\\nObstruction in the urinary tract is common and important\\nbecause it increases the susceptibility to infection and stoneformation. Obstruction can occur at any age and in eithersex. The cause of obstruction may lie at any level of theurinary tract—renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder andurethra. The obstruction at any of these anatomic locationsmay be intraluminal, intramural or extramural. Importantcauses are listed in Table 22.17 and illustrated in Fig. 22.38 .\\nThe obstruction may be unilateral or bilateral, partial or\\ncomplete, sudden or insidious. Complete bilateralobstruction may result in irreversible renal failure, whereaslong-standing chronic partial obstruction may cause variousfunctional abnormalities and anatomic changes. There arethree important anatomic sequelae of obstruction, namely:hydronephrosis, hydroureter and hypertrophy of the bladder.Before describing these conditions, an account of the most\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.17: Causes of Obstructive Uropathy.\\nA.

Urinary calculi are worldwidein distribution but are particularly common in somegeographic locations such as in parts of the United States,South Africa, India and South-East Asia. It is estimated thatapproximately 2% of the population experiences renal stonedisease at sometime in their life with male-female ratio of2:1. The peak incidence is observed in 2nd to 3rd decades oflife. Renal calculi are characterised clinically by colicky pain\\n691CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractFigure 22.38 Causes of obstructive uropathy.\\n(renal colic)  as they pass down along the ureter and manifest\\nby haematuria.\\nTypes of Urinary Calculi\\nThere are 4 main types of urinary calculi—calcium\\ncontaining, mixed (struvite), uric acid and cystine stones, anda few rare types (Table 22.18).\\n1. CALCIUM STONES.  Calcium stones are the most\\ncommon comprising about 75% of all urinary calculi. Theymay be pure stones of calcium oxalate (50%) or calciumphosphate (5%), or mixture of calcium oxalate and calciumphosphate (45%).\\nEtiology.  Etiology of calcium stones is variable.\\ni) About 50% of patients with calcium stones have idiopathic\\nhypercalciuria without hypercalcaemia.\\nii)\\nApproximately 10% cases are associated with hyper-\\ncalcaemia  and hypercalciuria,  most commonly due to hyper-\\nparathyroidism, or a defect in the bowel (i.e. absorptive\\nhypercalciuria), or in the kidney (i.e. renal hypercalciuria).\\niii)About 15% of patients with calcium stones have\\nhyperuricosuria with a normal blood uric acid level  and without\\nany abnormality of calcium metabolism.iv) In about 25% of patients with calcium stones, the cause\\nis unknown as there is no abnormality in urinary excretionof calcium, uric acid or oxalate and is referred to as ‘idiopathic\\ncalcium stone disease’.Pathogenesis.  The mechanism of calcium stone formation is\\nexplained on the basis of imbalance between the degree of\\nsupersaturation of the ions forming the stone and the\\nconcentration of inhibitors in the urine. Most likely site wherethe crystals of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphateare precipitated is the tubular lining or around some\\nfragment of debris in the tubule acting as nidus of the stone.\\nThe stone grows, as more and more crystals are depositedaround the nidus. A number of other predisposing factorscontributing to formation of calcium stones are alkaline\\nurinary pH, decreased urinary volume and increased\\nexcretion of oxalate and uric acid.\\nMorphology.  Calcium stones are usually small (less than a\\ncentimeter), ovoid, hard, with granular rough surface. They\\nare dark brown due to old blood pigment deposited in themas a result of repeated trauma caused to the urinary tract by\\nthese sharp-edged stones.\\n2. MIXED (STRUVITE) STONES.  About 15% of urinary\\ncalculi are made of magnesium-ammonium-calcium\\nphosphate, often called struvite;  hence mixed stones are also\\ncalled as ‘struvite stones’  or ‘triple phosphate stones’.\\nEtiology.  Struvite stones are formed as a result of infection\\nof the urinary tract with urea-splitting organisms thatproduce urease such as by species of Proteus,  and occasionally\\nKlebsiella, Pseudomonas  and Enterobacter.  These are, therefore,\\nalso known as infection-induced stones. However, E. coli  does\\nnot form urease.\\nMorphology.  Struvite stones are yellow-white or grey. They\\ntend to be soft and friable and irregular in shape. ‘Staghorn\\nstone’ which is a large, solitary stone that takes the shape ofthe renal pelvis wher e it is often formed is an example of\\nstruvite stone (Fig. 22.39) .\\nFigure 22.39 Staghorn renal stone with chronic pyelonephritis.The\\nkidney is enlarged and heavy . The capsule is adherent to the cortex and\\nhas irregular scars on the surface. Sectioned surface shows dilated pelvi-calyceal system with atrophied and thin peripheral cortex. The pelvis ofthe kidney contains a single, large, sof t yellow white stone t aking thecontour of the pelvi-calyceal system (arrow).\\n692SECTION III Systemic Pathology3. URIC ACID STONES.  Approximately 6% of urinary\\ncalculi are made of uric acid. Uric acid calculi are radiolucent\\nunlike radio-opaque calcium stones.\\nEtiology.  Uric acid stones are frequently formed in cases with\\nhyperuricaemia and hyperuricosuria such as due to primary\\ngout or secondary gout due to myeloproliferative disorders(e.g. in leukaemias), especially those on chemotherapy, andadministration of uricosuric drugs (e.g. salicylates,probenacid). Other factors contributing to their formation areacidic urinary pH (below 6) and low urinary volume.\\nPathogenesis.  The solubility of uric acid at pH of 7 is 200\\nmg/dl while at pH of 5 is 15 mg/dl. Thus, as the urine\\nbecomes more acidic, the solubility of uric acid in urinedecreases and precipitation of uric acid crystals increasesfavouring the formation of uric acid stones. Hyperuricosuriais the most important factor in the production of uric acidstones, while hyperuricaemia is found in about half the cases.\\nMorphology.  Uric acid stones are smooth, yellowish-brown,\\nhard and often multiple. On cut section, they show laminated\\nstructure.\\n4. CYSTINE STONES.  Cystine stones comprise less than\\n2% of urinary calculi.\\nEtiology.  Cystine stones are associated with cystinuria due\\nto a genetically-determined defect in the transport of cystine\\nand other amino acids across the cell membrane of the renaltubules and the small intestinal mucosa.\\nPathogenesis.  The resultant excessive excretion of cystine\\nwhich is least soluble of the naturally-occurring amino acids\\nleads to formation of crystals and eventually cystine calculi.\\nMorphology.  Cystine stones are small, rounded, smooth and\\noften multiple. They are yellowish and waxy.\\n5. OTHER CALCULI.  Less than 2% of urinary calculi\\nconsist of other rare types such as due to inherited abnor-\\nmality of enzyme metabolism e.g. hereditary xanthinuriadeveloping xanthine stones.\\nHYDRONEPHROSIS\\nHydronephrosis is the term used for dilatation of renal pelvis\\nand calyces due to partial or intermittent obstruction to the\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.18: Salient Features of Urinary Calculi.\\nType Incidence Etiology Pathogenesis\\n1.

Hydronephrosis develops if\\none or both the pelviureteric sphincters are incompetent, asotherwise there will be dilatation and hypertrophy of theurinary bladder but no hydronephrosis. Hydroureter nearlyalways accompanies hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis maybe unilateral or bilateral.\\nUnilateral Hydronephrosis\\nThis occurs due to some form of ureteral obstruction at the\\nlevel of pelviureteric junction (PUJ). The causes are:\\n1.Intraluminal  e.g. a calculus in the ureter or renal pelvis.\\n2.Intramural  e.g. congenital PUJ obstruction, atresia of\\nureter, inflammatory stricture, trauma, neoplasm of ureter\\nor bladder.\\n3.\\nExtramural  e.g. obstruction of upper part of the ureter\\nby inferior renal artery or vein, pressure on ureter from\\noutside such as carcinoma cervix, prostate, rectum, colon orcaecum and retroperitoneal fibrosis.\\nBilateral Hydronephrosis\\nThis is generally the result of some form of urethral obstruc-\\ntion but can occur from the various causes listed above if thelesions involve both sides. Based on this, hydronephrosis maybe of following types:\\n1. Congenital  e.g. atresia of the urethral meatus, congenital\\nposterior urethral valve.\\n2.Acquired  e.g. bladder tumour involving both ureteric\\norifices, prostatic enlargement, prostatic carcinoma and\\nprostatitis, bladder neck stenosis, inflammatory or traumaticurethral stricture and phimosis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The pathologic changes\\nvary depending upon whether the obstruction is suddenand complete, or incomplete and intermittent. The lattersituation is more common.Grossly,  the kidneys may have moderate to marked\\nenlargement. Initially, there is extrarenal hydronephrosis\\ncharacterised by dilatation of renal pelvis medially in theform of a sac (Fig. 22.40,A) . As the obstruction persists,693CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tract\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 22.18: Urinary Calculi (continued)\\nMorphology\\nCalcium oxalate stones\\nStruvite (‘Staghorn’) stone\\nUric acid stones\\nCystine stones\\nFigure facing Table 22.18\\nTUMOURS OF KIDNEY\\nBoth benign and malignant tumours occur in the kidney, the\\nlatter being more common. These may arise from renal tubules\\n(adenoma, adenocarcinoma), embryonic tissue  (mesoblastic\\nnephroma, Wilms’ tumour), mesenchymal tissue\\n(angiomyolipoma, medullary interstitial tumour) and fromthe epithelium of the renal pelvis  (urothelial carcinoma). Besides\\nthese tumours, the kidney may be the site of the secondarytumours.\\nTable 22.19  provides a list of kidney tumours; the impor-\\ntant forms of renal neoplasms are described below.\\nBENIGN  TUMOURS\\nBenign renal tumours are usually small and are often an\\nincidental finding at autopsy or nephrectomy.\\nCortical Adenoma\\nCortical tubular adenomas are more common than other\\nbenign renal neoplasms. They are frequently multiple andassociated with chronic pyelonephritis or benignnephrosclerosis.\\nGrossly,  these tumours may form tiny nodules up to 3\\ncm in diameter. They are encapsulated and white oryellow.Microscopically,  they are composed of tubular cords or\\npapillary structures projecting into cystic space. The cellsof the adenoma are usually uniform, cuboidal with noatypicality or mitosis. However, size of the tumour ratherthan histologic criteria is considered more significantparameter to predict the behaviour of the tumour—thoselarger than 3 cm in diameter are potentially malignantand metastasising.there is progressive dilatation of pelvis and calyces andpressure atrophy of renal parenchyma. Eventually, thedilated pelvi-calyceal system extends deep into the renalcortex so that a thin rim of renal cortex is stretched overthe dilated calyces and the external surface assumeslobulated appearance. This advanced stage is called asintrarenal hydronephrosis  (Fig. 22.40,B). An important point\\nof distinction between the sectioned surface of advancedhydronephrosis and polycystic kidney disease (page 657)is the direct continuity of dilated cystic spaces (i.e. dila-ted calyces) with the renal pelvis in the former  (Fig. 22.41) .\\nMicroscopically,  the wall of hydronephrotic sac is\\nthickened due to fibrous scarring and chronic inflam-matory cell infiltrate. There is progressive atrophy oftubules and glomeruli alongwith interstitial fibrosis. Stasisof urine in hydronephrosis causes infection (pyelitis)\\nresulting in filling of the sac with pus, a condition calledpyonephrosis.\\nFigure 22.40 Hydronephrosis, stages in its evolution.\\nFigure 22.41 Hydronephrosis with nephrolithiasis. The kidney is\\nenlarged and heavy . On cut section, the renal pelvis and calyces are\\ndilated and cystic and contain a large stone in the pelvis of the kidney(arrow). The cystic change is seen to extend into renal p arenchyma,\\ncompressing the cortex as a thin rim at the periphery . Unlike polycystickidney, however, these cysts are communicating with the pelvi-calycealsystem.\\n694SECTION III Systemic Pathology Oncocytoma\\nOncocytoma is a benign epithelial tumour arising from\\ncollecting ducts.\\nGrossly,  The tumour is encapsulated and has variable size.\\nCut section is homogeneous and has characteristicmahogany-brown or tan colour.\\nMicroscopically,  the tumour cells are plump with\\nabundant, finely granular, acidophilic cytoplasm and\\nround nuclei. Electron microscopy demonstratesnumerous mitochondria in the cytoplasm.\\nOther Benign Tumours\\nAngiomyolipoma  is a hamartoma of the kidney that\\ncontains differentiated tissue element derived from bloodvessels, smooth muscle and fat. Patients of tuberous sclerosis,a multisystem disease characterised by skin lesions, CNS andrenal involvement, frequently have bilateral angiomyo-lipomas.\\nMesoblastic nephroma  is a congenital benign tumour.\\nGrossly,  the tumour resembles a uterine leiomyoma in\\nhaving whorled appearance.Microscopically,  it shows cellular growth of spindle cells\\nderived from secondary mesenchyme.\\nMulticystic nephroma  is another uncommon tumour of\\nearly infancy.Grossly,  it is a solitary, unilateral well demarcated tumour\\nof varying size. Cut surface shows characteristicmultilocular appearance.Microscopically, the cysts are lined by tubular epitheliumwhile the stroma between the cysts contains mesenchymaltissue with some immature blastemal or abortive tubules.Some authors consider this entity as fully-differentiatedvariant of Wilms’ tumour. However, clinically multicysticnephroma is always benign compared to Wilms’ tumour.\\nMedullary interstitial cell tumour  is a tiny nodule in the\\nmedulla composed of fibroblast-like cells in hyalinisedstroma. These tumours used to be called renal fibromas  but\\nelectron microscopy has revealed that the tumour cells arenot fibrocytes but are medullary interstitial cells.\\nJuxtaglomerular tumour or reninoma  is a rare tumour\\nof renal cortex consisting of sheets of epithelioid cells withmany small blood vessels. The tumour secretes excessivequantities of renin and, thus, the patients are likely to havehypertension.\\nMALIGNANT TUMOURS\\nThe two most common primary malignant tumours of the\\nkidney are adenocarcinoma  and Wilms’ tumour.  A third\\nmalignant renal tumour is urothelial carcinoma  occurring more\\ncommonly in the renal pelvis is described in the next sectionalong with other tumours of the lower urinary tract.\\nAdenocarcinoma of Kidney (Synonyms: Renal cell\\ncarcinoma, Hypernephroma, Grawitz tumour)\\nHypernephroma is an old misnomer under the mistaken\\nbelief that the tumour arises from adrenal rests because ofthe resemblance of the tumour cells with clear cells of theadrenal cortex. It is now known that the renal cell carcinoma(RCC) is an adenocarcinoma arising from tubular epithelium.This cancer comprises 70 to 80% of all renal cancers andoccurs most commonly in 50 to 70 years of age with malepreponderance (2:1).\\nETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS.  Various etiologic\\nfactors implicated in the etiology of RCC are as follows:\\n1. Tobacco. Tobacco  is the major risk factor for RCC,\\nwhether chewed or smoked and accounts for 20-30% cases\\nof RCC. Cigarette smokers have two-fold higher risk ofdeveloping RCC.\\n2.Genetic factors.  Heredity and first-degree relatives of\\nRCC are associated with higher risk. Although majority of\\ncases of RCC are sporadic but about 5% cases are inherited.These cases have following associations:\\ni)von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease:  It is an autosomal\\ndominant cancer syndrome that includes: haemangio-\\nblastoma of the cerebellum, retinal angiomas, multiple RCC(clear cell type), pheochromocytoma and cysts in differentorgans. Patients of VHL disease have germline mutations oftumour suppressor VHL gene located on chromosome 3p,\\ncommonly as homozygous loss of VHL  gene.

Cystic diseases of the kidneys. Both  hereditary and\\nacquired cystic diseases of the kidney have increased risk of\\ndevelopment of RCC. Patients on longterm dialysis developacquired cystic disease which may evolve into RCC andadenomas. Adult polycystic kidney disease and multicysticnephroma is associated with higher occurrence of papillaryRCC.\\n4. Other risk factors. Besides above, following other factors\\nare associated with higher incidence of RCC:\\ni) Exposure to asbestos, heavy metals and petrochemical\\nproducts.\\nii) In women, obesity and oestrogen therapy.\\niii) Analgesic nephropathy.v) Tuberous sclerosis.\\nCLASSIFICATION.  Based on cytogenetics of sporadic and\\nfamilial tumours, RCC has been reclassified into clear cell,\\npapillary, granular cell, chromophobe, sarcomatoid andcollecting duct type (Table 22.20).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  RCC commonly\\narises from the poles of the kidney as a solitary andunilateral tumour, more often in the upper pole. Thetumour is generally large, golden yellow and circum-scribed. Papillary tumours have grossly visible papillaeand may be multifocal. About 1% RCC are bilateral. Cutsection of the tumour commonly shows large areas ofischaemic necrosis, cystic change and foci of haemor-rhages. Another significant characteristic is the frequentpresence of tumour thrombus in the renal vein which mayextend into the vena cava (Fig. 22.42) .\\nHistologically,  the features of various types of RCC are\\nas under:1.Clear cell type RCC (70%):  This is the most common\\npattern. The clear cytoplasm of tumour cells is due toremoval of glycogen and lipid from the cytoplasm duringprocessing of tissues. The tumour cells have a variety ofpatterns: solid, trabecular and tubular, separated bydelicate vasculature. Majority of clear cell tumours are welldifferentiated (Fig. 22.43) .\\n2.Papillary type RCC (15%):  The tumour cells are arran-\\nged in papillary pattern over the fibrovascular stalks. Thetumour cells are cuboidal with small round nuclei.Psammoma bodies may be seen.3.Granular cell type RCC (8%):  The tumour cells have\\nabundant acidophilic cytoplasm. These tumours havemore marked nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatismand cellular atypia.\\n4.Chromophobe type RCC (5%):  This type shows\\nadmixture of pale clear cells with perinuclear halo and\\nacidophilic granular cells. The cytoplasm of these tumourcells contains many vesicles.\\n5.Sarcomatoid type RCC (1.5%):  This is the most anaplastic\\nand poorly differentiated form. The tumour is\\ncharacterised by whorls of atypical spindle tumour cells.\\n6.Collecting duct type RCC (0.5%):  This is a rare type that\\noccurs in the medulla. It is composed of  a single  layer of\\ncuboidal tumour cells arranged in tubular and papillarypattern.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Renal cell carcinoma is generally a\\nslow-growing tumour and the tumour may have beenpresent for years before it is detected.

Collecting duct type 0.5% — Tubular and papillary pattern696SECTION III Systemic Pathologyevidence for diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma is the triad of\\ngross haematuria, flank plain  and palpable abdominal mass.  The\\nmost common presenting abnormality is haematuria that\\noccurs in about 60% of cases. By the time the tumour isdetected, it has spread to distant sites via haematogenousroute to the lungs, brain and bone, and locally to the liver\\nand perirenal lymph nodes.\\nSystemic symptoms of fatiguability, weight loss, cachexia\\nand intermittent fever unassociated with evidence of infection\\nare found in many cases at presentation. A number ofparaneoplastic syndromes due to ectopic hormoneproduction by the renal cell carcinoma have been described.\\nThese include polycythaemia (by erythropoietin), hyper-\\ncalcaemia  (by parathyroid hormone and prostaglandins),hypertension  (by renin), effects of feminisation  or masculinisation\\n(by gonadotropins) and Cushing’s syndrome  (by gluco-\\ncorticoids).\\nThe prognosis  in renal cell carcinoma depends upon the\\nextent of tumour involvement at the time of diagnosis. The\\noverall 5-year survival rate is about 70%. Presence ofmetastases, renal vein invasion and higher nuclear grade ofthe tumour are some of the predictors of poor prognosis.\\nWilms’  Tumour\\n(Synonym: Nephroblastoma)\\nNephroblastoma or Wilms’ tumour is an embryonic tumour\\nderived from primitive renal epithelial and mesenchymalcomponents. It is the most common abdominal malignantFigure 22.42 Renal cell carcinoma. The upper pole of the kidney\\nshows a large and tan mass while rest of the kidney has reniform contour .\\nSectioned surface shows irregular , circumscribed, yellowish mass with\\nareas of haemorrhages and necrosis. The residual kidney is compressed\\non one side and shows obliterated calyces and renal pelvis.\\nFigure 22.43 Renal cell carcinoma. The tumour shows solid masses and acini of uniform-appearing tumour cells. Clear cells predominate in\\nthe tumour while the stroma is composed of fine and delicate fibrous tissue.\\n697CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary Tracttumour of young children, seen most commonly between 1\\nto 6 years of age with equal sex incidence.\\nETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS.  Wilms’ tumour has\\nfollowing etiologic associations:\\n1. A defect in chromosome 11p13  results in abnormal growth\\nof metanephric blastema without differentiation into normal\\ntubules and glomeruli.\\n2. A higher incidence has been seen in monozygotic twins\\nand cases with family history.3. Association of Wilms’ tumour with some other congenital\\nanomalies  has been observed, especially of the genitourinary\\ntract.\\n4. A few other malignancies  are known to have higher\\nincidence of Wilms’ tumour. These include osteosarcoma,\\nbotyroid sarcoma, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma etc.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nusually quite large, spheroidal, replacing most of thekidney. It is generally solitary and unilateral but5-10% cases may have bilateral tumour. On cut section,the tumour shows characteristic variegated appearance—soft, fishflesh-like grey-white to cream-yellow tumourwith foci of necrosis and haemorrhages and grosslyidentifiable myxomatous or cartilaginous elements(Fig. 22.44) . Invasion into renal vein is grossly evident in\\nhalf the cases.Microscopically,  nephroblastoma shows mixture of\\nprimitive epithelial and mesenchymal elements. Most ofthe tumour consists of small, round to spindled,anaplastic, sarcomatoid tumour cells. In these areas arepresent abortive tubules and poorly-formed glomerularstructures (Fig. 22.45) . Mesenchymal elements such as\\nsmooth and skeletal muscle, cartilage and bone, fat cellsand fibrous tissue, may be seen.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The most common presenting\\nfeature is a palpable abdominal mass in a child. OtherFigure 22.44 Nephroblastoma (W ilms’ tumour). The kidney is\\nenlarged and has ovoid and nodular appearance. The sectioned surface\\nshows replacement of almost whole kidney by the tumour leaving a thinstrip of compressed renal tissue at lower end (arrow). Cut section of thetumour is gray white, fleshy and has small areas of haemorrhages and\\nnecrosis.\\nFigure 22.45 Wilms’ tumour. There is predominance of small round to spindled sarcomatoid tumour cells. A few abortive tubules and poorly-\\nformed glomerular structures are present in it.\\n698SECTION III Systemic Pathologycommon abnormalities are haematuria, pain, fever and\\nhypertension. The tumour rapidly spreads via blood,especially to lungs.\\nThe prognosis  of the tumour with combination therapy\\nof nephrectomy, post-operative irradiation and chemo-therapy, has improved considerably and the 5-year survivalnow is 80-90%.\\nSecondary  Tumours\\nLeukaemic infiltration of the kidneys is a common finding,\\nparticularly in chronic myeloid leukaemia. Kidney is acommon site for blood-borne metastases from differentprimary sites, chiefly from cancers of the lungs, breast andstomach.\\nLOWER  URINARY  TRACT\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe lower urinary tract consists of ureters, urinary bladder  and\\nurethra.URETERS  are tubular structures, 30 cm in length and half a\\ncentimeter in diameter, and extend from the renal pelvis\\n(pelvi-ureteric junction) to the urinary bladder (vesico-ureteric junction). Normally they enter obliquely into thebladder, so that ureter is compressed during micturition, thuspreventing vesico-ureteric reflux. Ureters lie retroperitoneallythroughout their course.\\nHistologically,  ureter has an outer fibrous investing layer\\nwhich overlies a thick muscular layer and is lined internally\\nby transitional epithelium or urothelium similar to the liningof the renal pelvis above and bladder below.\\nURINARY BLADDER  lies extraperitoneally and the\\nperitoneum is reflected on its superior surface. Besides\\nsuperior surface (or dome), the bladder has posterior surface\\n(or base)  and two lateral surfaces . The trigone  is at the base of\\nthe bladder and continues as blader neck . Normally, the\\ncapacity of bladder is about 400 to 500 ml without over-distension. Micturition is partly a reflex and partly avoluntary act under the control of sympathetic andparasympathetic innervation.\\nHistologically,  the greater part of the bladder wall is made\\nup of muscular layer (detrusor muscle) having 3 coats—\\ninternal, middle and external. The trigone  muscle is derived\\nfrom the prolongation of the longitudinal muscle layer ofeach ureter. The inner layer of bladder consists of urothelium6-7 layers in thickness. The superficial epithelial layer is madeof larger cells in the form of a row and have abundanteosinphilic cytoplasm; these cells are called umbrella cells .\\nURETHRA  runs from the bladder up to the external meatus.\\nThe male urethra  consists of 3 parts—prostatic, membranous\\nand penile. It is lined in the prostatic part by urothelium butelsewhere by stratified columnar epithelium except near itsorifice where the epithelium is stratified squamous. Theurethral mucosa rests on highly vascular submucosa andouter layer of striated muscle. There are numerous smallmucous glands in the urethral mucosa. The female urethra  is\\nshorter and runs from the bladder parallel with the anteriorwall of the vagina. The mucous membrane in female urethrais lined throughout by columnar epithelium except near thebladder where the epithelium is transitional. The other layersand mucous glands are similar to those in male urethra.\\nCONGENITAL ANOMALIES\\nVesicoureteric reflux  is the most common anomaly described\\nalready on page 682. A few others are considered below.DOUBLE URETER.  This is a condition in which the entire\\nureter or only the upper part is duplicated. Double ureter is\\ninvariably associated with a double renal pelvis, one in the\\nupper part and the other  in the lower part of the kidney. If\\ndouble ureter affects the entire length, then there are twoseparate openings into the bladder on one side but morecommonly they are joined in the intravesical portion andopen by a single ureteric orifice.\\nURETEROCELE.  Ureterocele is cystic dilatation of the\\nterminal part of the ureter which lies within the bladder wall.\\nThe cystic dilatation lies beneath the bladder mucosa andcan be visualised by cystoscopy.\\nECTOPIA VESICAE (EXSTROPHY).  This is a rare condition\\nowing to congenital developmental deficiency of anterior\\nwall of the bladder and is associated with splitting of theoverlying anterior abdominal wall. This results in exposedinterior of the bladder. There may be prolapse of the posteriorwall of the bladder through the defect in the anterior bladderand abdominal wall. The condition in males is oftenassociated with epispadias  in which the urethra opens on the\\ndorsal aspect of penis. If the defect is not properly repaired,the exposed bladder mucosa gets infected repeatedly andmay undergo squamous metaplasia with subsequentincreased tendency to develop carcinoma of the bladder.\\nURACHAL ABNORMALITIES.  Rarely, there may be\\npersistence of the urachus in which urine passes from the\\nbladder to the umbilicus. More often, part of urachus remains\\npatent which may be the umbilical end, bladder end, or\\ncentral portion. Persistence of central portion gives rise tourachal cyst  lined by transitional or squamous epithelium.\\nAdenocarcinoma may develop in urachal cyst.\\nINFLAMMATIONS\\nUrinary tract infection (UTI)  is common, especially in females\\nand has been described already along with its morphologic\\nconsequences (page 681). Inflammation of the tissues of lowerurinary tract (ureteritis, cystitis and urethritis) are consideredhere.\\nUreteritis\\nInfection of the ureter is almost always secondary to pyelitis\\nabove, or cystitis below. Ureteritis is usually mild butrepeated and longstanding infection may give rise to chronic\\nureteritis.699CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractCystitis\\nInflammation of the urinary bladder is called cystitis. Primary\\ncystitis is rare since the normal bladder epithelium is quite\\nresistant to infection. Cystitis may occur by spread of\\ninfection from upper urinary tract as seen following renaltuberculosis, or may spread from the urethra such as ininstrumentation. Cystitis is caused by a variety of bacterial\\nand fungal infections as discussed in the etiology of\\npyelonephritis (page 682). The most common pathogenicorganism in UTI is E. coli,  followed in decreasing frequency\\nby Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas  and Proteus.  Infection\\nwith Candida albicans may occur in the bladder in immuno-\\nsuppressed patients. Besides bacterial and fungal organisms,parasitic infestations such as with Schistosoma haematobium\\nis common in the Middle-East countries, particularly in\\nEgypt. Chlamydia  and Mycoplasma  may occasionally cause\\ncystitis. In addition, radiation, direct exposure to chemical\\nirritant, foreign bodies and local trauma may all initiatecystitis.\\nCystitis, like UTI, is more common in females than in\\nmales because of the shortness of urethra which is liable tofaecal contamination and due to mechanical trauma duringsexual intercourse. In males, prostatic obstruction is a\\nfrequent cause of cystitis. All forms of cystitis are clinically\\ncharacterised by a triad  of symptoms —frequency  (repeated\\nurinati on), dysuria  (painful or burning micturition) and low\\nabdominal pain.  There may, however, be systemic manifes-\\ntations of bacteraemia such as fever, chills and malaise.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Cystitis may be acute or\\nchronic.\\nACUTE CYSTITIS. Grossly,  the bladder mucosa is red,\\nswollen and haemorrhagic. There may be suppurative\\nexudate or ulcers on the bladder mucosa.Microscopically,  this form of cystitis is characterised by\\nintense neutrophilic exudate admixed with lymphocytesand macrophages. There is oedema and congestion ofmucosa.\\nCHRONIC CYSTITIS.  Repeated attacks of acute cystitis\\nlead to chronic cystitis.\\nGrossly,  the mucosal epithelium is thickened, red and\\ngranular with formation of polypoid masses. Long-standing cases result in thickened bladder wall andshrunken cavity.Microscopically,  there is patchy ulceration of the mucosa\\nwith formation of granulation tissue in the regions ofpolypoid masses. Submucosa and muscular coat showfibrosis and infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells. Aform of chronic cystitis characterised by formation of lym-phoid follicles in the bladder mucosa is termed cystitis\\nfollicularis.\\nA few other special forms of cystitis having distinct\\nclinical and morphological appearance are described below.\\nINTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS (HUNNER’S ULCER).  This\\nvariant of cystitis occurs in middle-aged women. The patientsget repeated attacks of severe and excruciating pain on\\ndistension of the bladder, frequency of micturition and greatdecrease in bladder capacity. Cystoscopy often reveals alocalised ulcer. The etiology  of the condition is unknown but\\nit is thought to be neurogenic in origin.\\nMicroscopically,  the submucosa and muscle coat show\\nincreased fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrate,chiefly lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils.\\nCYSTITIS CYSTICA.  As a result of long-standing chronic\\ninflammation, there occurs a downward projection ofepithelial nests known as Brunn’s nests  from the deeper layer\\nof bladder mucosa. These epithelial cells may appear as smallcystic inclusions in the bladder wall, or may actually developcolumnar metaplasia with secretions in the lumen of cysts.\\nMALAKOPLAKIA.  This is a rare condition most frequently\\nfound in the urinary bladder but can occur in the ureters,\\nkidney, testis and prostate, and occasionally in the gut. Theetiology of the condition is unknown but probably results from\\npersistence of chronic inflammation with defectivephagocytic process by the macrophages. Malakoplakiaoccurs more frequently in immunosuppressed patients andrecipients of transplants.\\nGrossly,  the lesions appear as soft, flat, yellowish, slightly\\nraised plaques on the bladder mucosa. They may varyfrom 0.5 to 5 cm in diameter.Microscopically,  the plaques are composed of massive\\naccumulation of foamy macrophages with occasionalmultinucleate giant cells and some lymphocytes. Thesemacrophages have granular PAS-positive cytoplasm andsome of them contain cytoplasmic laminated concretionsof calcium phosphate called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies.\\nThese bodies ultrastructurally represent lysosomes filledwith partly digested debris of bacteria phagocytosed bymacrophages which have not been digested fully by themdue to defective phagocytosis.\\nPOLYPOID CYSTITIS.  Polypoid cystitis is characterised by\\npapillary projections on the bladder mucosa due tosubmucosal oedema and can be confused with transitionalcell carcinoma. The condition occurs due to indwellingcatheters and infection.\\nUrethritis\\nUrethritis may be gonococcal  or non-gonococcal.\\nGonococcal (gonorrhoeal) urethritis  is an acute\\nsuppurative condition caused by gonococci (Neisseria gonorr-\\nhoeae).  The mucosa and submucosa are eventually converted\\ninto granulation tissue which becomes fibrosed and scarred\\nresulting in urethral stricture.\\nNon-gonococcal urethritis  is more common and is most\\nfrequently caused by E. coli.  The infection of urethra often\\naccompanies cystitis in females and prostatitis in males.Urethritis is one of the components in the triad of Reiter’ssyndrome which comprises arthritis, conjunctivitis and700SECTION III Systemic Pathologyurethritis (Chapter 4). The pathologic changes are similar to\\ninflammation of the lower urinary tract elsewhere butstrictures are less common than following gonococcalinfection of the urethra.\\nTUMOURS\\nMajority of lower urinary tract tumours are epithelial. Both\\nbenign and malignant tumours occur; the latter being morecommon. About 90% of malignant tumours of the lowerurinary tract occur in the urinary bladder, 8% in the renalpelvis and remaining 2% are seen in the urethra or ureters.\\nTUMOURS OF THE BLADDER\\nEpithelial (Urothelial) Bladder T umours\\nMore than 90% of bladder tumours arise from transitional\\nepithelial (urothelium) lining of the bladder in continuitywith the epithelial lining of the renal pelvis, ureters, and themajor part of the urethra. Though many workers considerall transitional cell tumours as transitional cell carcinoma,others distinguish true transitional cell papilloma from gradeI transitional cell carcinoma.\\nBladder cancer comprises about 3% of all cancers. Most\\nof the cases appear beyond 5th decade of life with 3-timeshigher preponderance in males than females.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Urothelial tumours in the urinary\\ntract are typically multifocal and the pattern of disease\\nbecomes apparent over a period of years. A number of\\nenvironmental and host factors are associated with increased\\nrisk of bladder cancer. These are as under:\\n1. Industrial occupations.  Workers in industries that\\nproduce aniline dyes, rubber, plastic, textiles, and cable have\\nhigh incidence of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer may occurin workers in these factories after a prolonged exposure ofabout 20 years. The carcinogenic substances responsible forbladder cancer in these cases are the metabolites of β-\\nnaphthylamine and benzene.\\n2.Schistosomiasis.  There is increased risk of bladder cancer,\\nparticularly squamous cell carcinoma, in patients having\\nbilharzial infestation (Schistosoma haematobium)  of the\\nbladder. Schistosomiasis is common in Egypt and accountsfor high incidence of bladder cancer in that country. It isthought to induce local irritant effect and initiate squamousmetaplasia followed by squamous cell carcinoma.3\\n. Dietary factors.  Certain carcinogenic metabolites of\\ntryptophan are excreted in urine of patients with bladdercancer. These metabolites have been shown to induce bladdercancer in experimental animals. The role of artificialsweeteners like saccharin, coffee or caffeine and chronicalcoholism in the etiology of bladder cancer in man iscontroversial.\\n4. Local lesions.  A number of local lesions in the bladder\\npredispose to the development of bladder cancer. These\\ninclude ectopia vesicae (extrophied bladder), vesicaldiverticulum, leukoplakia of the bladder mucosa and urinarydiversion in defunctionalised bladder. All these conditionsare associated with squamous metaplasia and high incidenceof bladder cancer.\\n5. Smoking.  Tobacco smoking is associated with 2 to 3 fold\\nincreased risk of developing bladder cancer, probably due\\nto increased urinary excretion of carcinogenic substances.\\n6. Drugs.  Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclo-\\nphosphamide and patients having analgesic-abuse\\n(phenacetin-) nephropathy have high risk of developingbladder cancer.\\nMulticentric nature of urothelial cancer and high rate of\\nrecurrence has led to the hypothesis that a field effect  in the\\nurothelium is responsible for this form of cancer. This isresponsible for polychronotropism in bladder cancer i.e. thetumour tends to recur with time and develops at newlocations within the urinary tract.\\nSeveral cytogentic abnormalities have been seen in\\nbladder cancer. These include mutations in p53, RB gene and\\np21 gene, all of which are associated with higher rate of\\nrecurrences and metastasis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  urothelial\\ntumours may be single or multiple. About 90% of thetumours are papillary (non-invasive or invasive), whereasthe remaining 10% are flat indurated (non-invasive orinvasive) (Fig. 22.46) . The papillary tumours have free\\nfloating fern-like arrangement with a broad or narrowpedicle. The non-papillary tumours are bulkier withulcerated surface (Fig. 22.47) . More common locations for\\neither of the two types are the trigone, the region ofureteral orifices and on the lateral walls.Histologically,  urothelial tumours are of 3 cell types—\\ntransitional cell, squamous cell, and glandular(Table 22.21).\\nFigure 22.46 Gross patterns of epithelial bladder tumours.\\n701CHAPTER 22 The Kidney and Lower Urinary TractA. TRANSITIONAL CELL TUMOURS.  Approximately\\n90% of all epithelial tumours of the bladder are transitional\\ncell tumours. As stated before, transitional cell papillomais distinguished by some workers from grade I transitionalcell carcinoma (TCC), whereas others do not consider thisas a distinct entity.\\n1. Transitional cell papilloma.  Papillomas may occur\\nsingly or may be multiple. They are generally small, less\\nthan 2 cm in diameter, papillary with branching pattern.Each papilla is composed of fibrovascular stromal corecovered by normal-looking transitional cells havingnormal number of layers (upto 6-7) in thickness. Theindividual cells resemble the normal transitional cells anddo not vary in size and shape. Mitoses are absent and basalpolarity is retained. It must be emphasised that thedesignation transitional cell papilloma is purely a histo-logical diagnosis but does not imply an innocent biologicbehaviour. In fact, it may recur and behave in a malignantmanner.\\n2. Carcinoma in situ (CIS).  Foci of epithelial hyperplasia,\\ndysplasia and carcinoma in situ are seen in other parts of\\nthe bladder in non-invasive as well as in invasivecarcinomas. Similar foci may be present in the ureters andrenal pelvis. The malignant potential of epithelialhyperplasia and dysplasia is uncertain but carcinoma in\\nsitu is certainly precancerous and is currently included as\\ngrade 0 transitional cell carcinoma. Carcinoma in situ  is\\ncharacterised by anaplastic malignant cells confined tolayers superficial to basement membrane of the bladdermucosa. These pathologic changes can be induced inexperimental animals by chemical carcinogens. Therefore,it is reasonable to assume that these stages are precursorsof invasive bladder cancer.\\n3. Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).  This is the commo-\\nnest cancer of the bladder. The widely accepted\\nclassification of Mostofi (1960) adopted by the AmericanBladder Tumour Registry divides TCC into 3 grades. Thebasis for this grading depends upon 2 features: the degree\\nof anaplasia  and the extent of invasion.\\nThe criteria for anaplasia are: increased cellularity,\\nnuclear crowding, deranged cellular polarity, failure ofnormal orientation from base to the surface, variation incell size and shape, variation in nuclear chromatin pattern,mitotic figures and giant cells.\\nThe criteria for invasion  in papillary as well as non-\\npapillary tumours are: penetration of the basementmembrane of bladder mucosa.\\nBased on these salient features, the characteristics of\\nthree grades of transitional cell carcinoma are as under:\\nGrade I:  The tumour cells are clearly transitional type but\\nshow increased number of layers of cells (c.f. transitional\\ncell papilloma). The individual cells are generally regular\\nbut are slightly larger and show mild hyperchromatism.\\nGrade II:  The tumour cells are still recognisable as of\\ntransitional cell origin and the number of layers of cells is\\nincreased. The individual tumour cells are less regular,larger in size, and show pronounced nuclearhyperchromatism, mitotic activity and loss of polarity. Thetumour may or may not be invasive (Fig.22.48) .\\nGrade  III: This is the anaplastic or undifferentiated grade\\nof the tumour which is always invasive extending intothe bladder wall to variable depth depending upon theclinical stage (described later). The tumour cells are nolonger recognisable as of transitional origin. Theindividual tumour cells show pronounced features ofanaplasia such as marked pleomorphism, hyperchro-matism, total loss of polarity with loosened surface cellsexfoliated in the bladder lumen.\\nThere may be foci of squamous or glandular\\nmetaplasia in any grade of the tumour.\\nB. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA.  Squamous cell\\ncarcinoma comprises about 5% of the bladder carcinomas.\\nUnlike TCC which is mostly papillary and non-ulcerating,most squamous carcinomas of the bladder are sessile,nodular, infiltrating and ulcerating. Association ofsquamous carcinoma and schistosomiasis has alreadybeen highlighted. The carcinoma may be well-differentiated with keratin pearl formation, or may beanaplastic.\\nFigure 22.47 Carcinoma urinary bladder .

Adenocarcinoma (Rare)E. Mixed carcinoma (5%)702SECTION III Systemic PathologyC. ADENOCARCINOMA.  Adenocarcinoma of the\\nbladder is rare. Adenocarcinoma has association with\\nexostrophy of the bladder with glandular metaplasia, ormay arise from urachal rests, periurethral andperiprostatic glands, or from cystitis cystica. The tumouris characterised by glandular and tubular pattern with orwithout mucus production.\\nSTAGING OF BLADDER CANCER.  The clinical behaviour\\nand prognosis of bladder cancer can be assessed by thefollowing simple staging system:\\nStage 0:  Carcinoma confined to the mucosa.\\nStage A:  Carcinoma invades the lamina propria but not the\\nmuscularis.Stage B1:  Carcinoma invades the superficial muscle layer.\\nStage B2:  Carcinoma invades the deep muscle layer.\\nStage C:  Carcinoma invades the perivesical tissues.\\nStage D1:  Carcinoma shows regional metastases.\\nStage D2:  Carcinoma shows distant metastases.\\nNon-epithelial Bladder Tumours\\nThese may be benign or malignant.\\nBENIGN.  The most common benign mesenchymal tumour\\nof the bladder is leiomyoma. Other less common examples\\nare neurofibroma, haemangioma and granular cellmyoblastoma.\\nMALIGNANT.  Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most frequent\\nmalignant mesenchymal tumour. It exists in 2 forms:\\nAdult form  occurring in adults over 40 years of age and\\nresembles the rhabdomyosarcoma of skeletal muscle.Childhood form  occurring in infancy and childhood and\\nappears as large polypoid, soft, fleshy, grapelike mass\\nand is also called sarcoma botryoides  or embryonal rhabdo-Figure 22.48 Transitional cell carcinoma, grade II. There is increase in the number of layers of epithelium. The cells are still recognisabl e as\\nof transitional origin and show features of anaplasia.\\nmyosarcoma. It is morphologically characterised by\\nmasses of embryonic mesenchyme consisting of massesof highly pleomorphic stellate cells in myxomatousbackground. Similar tumours occur in the female genitaltract (Chapter 24).\\nTUMOURS OF RENAL PELVIS AND URETERS\\nAlmost all the tumours of the renal pelvis and ureters are of\\nepithelial origin. They are of the same types as are seen inthe urinary bladder. However, tumours in the ureters arequite rare.\\nTUMOURS OF URETHRA\\nTumours of the urethra are rare except for the urethral\\ncaruncle which is a tumour-like lesion.\\nURETHRAL CARUNCLE.  Urethral caruncle is not\\nuncommon. It is an inflammatory lesion present on external\\nurethral meatus in elderly females.\\nGrossly,  the caruncle appears as a solitary, 1 to 2 cm in\\ndiameter, pink or red mass, protruding from urethralmeatus. It is quite friable and ulcerated.Microscopically,  the mass may be covered by squamous\\nor transitional epithelium or there may be ulceratedsurface. The underlying tissues show proliferating bloodvessels, fibroblastic connective tissue and intense acuteand chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Thus, the histologicappearance closely resembles a pyogenic granuloma.\\nURETHRAL CARCINOMA.  Carcinoma of the urethra is\\nuncommon. In most cases it occurs in the distal urethra nearthe external meatus and thus is commonly squamous cellcarcinoma. Less often, there may be transitional cellcarcinoma or adenocarcinoma arising from periurethralglands.\\n❑\\n703CHAPTER 23 The Male Reproductive System and Prostate\\nThe Male Reproductive System\\nand ProstateChapter 23Chapter 23\\nTESTIS AND EPIDIDYMIS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nContents of the scrotal sac include the testicle and epididymis\\nalong with lower end of the spermatic cord and the tunicavaginalis that forms the outer serous investing layer. Theepididymis is attached to body of the testis posteriorly. Thus,the testicle and epididymis may be regarded as one organ.\\nStructurally, the main components of the testicle are the\\nseminiferous tubules which when uncoiled are ofconsiderable length.\\nHistologically,  the seminiferous tubules are formed of a\\nlamellar connective tissue membrane and contain several\\nlayers of cells (Fig. 23.1,A) . In the adult, the cells lining the\\nseminiferous tubules are of 2 types:\\n1.Spermatogonia  or germ cells which produce spermatocytes\\n(primary and secondary), spermatids and mature\\nspermatozoa.\\n2.Sertoli cells  which are larger and act as supportive cells\\nto germ cells, produce mainly androgen (testosterone) and\\nlittle oestrogen.\\nThe seminiferous tubules drain into collecting ducts\\nwhich form the rete testis from where the secretions passinto the vasa efferentia. Vasa efferentia opens at the upperend of the epididymis. The lower end of the epididymis isprolonged into a thick muscular tube, the vas deferens,  thattransports the secretions into the urethra.\\nThe fibrovascular stroma present between the\\nseminiferous tubules contains varying number of interstitial\\ncells of Leydig.  Leydig cells have abundant cytoplasm\\ncontaining lipid granules and elongated Reinke’s crystals.These cells are the main source of testosterone and otherandrogenic hormones in males. Thus, Sertoli and Leydig cellsare hormone-producing cells homologous to their ovariancounterparts (granulosa-theca cells) and are termed specialised\\nstromal cells of  the gonads.\\nThus, the main functions  of the testis are to produce\\nsperms and testosterone.\\nCONGENITAL ANOMALIES\\nCryptorchidism\\nCryptorchidism or undescended testis is a condition in which\\nthe testicle is arrested at some point along its descent. Itsincidence is about 0.2% in adult male population. In 70% ofcases, the undescended testis lies in the inguinal ring, in 25%in the abdomen and, in the remaining 5%, it may be presentat other sites along its descent from intra-abdominal locationto the scrotal sac.\\nETIOLOGY.  The exact etiology is not known in majority of\\ncases. However, a few apparent causes associated with\\ncryptorchidism are as under:\\n1.Mechanical factors  e.g. short spermatic cord, narrow\\ninguinal canal, adhesions to the peritoneum.\\n2.Genetic factors  e.g. trisomy 13, maldevelopment of the\\nscrotum or cremaster muscles.\\n3.\\nHormonal  factors e.g. deficient androgenic secretions.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Cryptorchidism is unila-\\nteral in 80% cases and bilateral in the rest.\\nGrossly,  the cryptorchid testis is small in size, firm and\\nfibrotic.Histologically,  contrary to previous beliefs, the changes\\nof atrophy begin to appear by about 2 years of age. These\\nchanges are as under (Fig. 23.1,B) :\\n1.Seminiferous tubules:  There is progressive loss of germ\\ncell elements so that the tubules may be lined by onlyspermatogonia and spermatids but foci ofspermatogenesis are discernible in 10% of cases. Thetubular basement membrane is thickened. Advancedcases show hyalinised tubules with a few Sertoli cells only,surrounded by prominent basement membrane.2.Interstitial stroma: There is usually increase in the\\ninterstitial fibrovascular stroma and conspicuous presenceof Leydig cells, seen singly or in small clusters.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES. As such, cryptorchidism is comp-\\nletely asymptomatic and is discovered only on physicalexamination. However, if surgical correction by orchiopexyis not undertaken by about 2 years of age, or certainly in theprepubertal period, significant adverse clinical outcome mayresult as under:\\n1.Sterility-infertility.  Bilateral cryptorchidism is associa-\\nted with sterility while unilateral disease may result in\\ninfertility.\\n2.\\nInguinal hernia.  A concomitant inguinal hernia is\\nfrequently present along with cryptorchidism.\\n3. Malignancy.  Cryptorchid testis is at 30-50 times increa-\\nsed risk of developing testicular malignancy, most commonly\\nseminoma and embryonal carcinoma, than a normallydescended testis. The risk of malignancy is greater in intra-abdominal testis than in testis in the inguinal canal for thesimple reason that the neoplastic process in the testis inscrotal location is detected early than intra-abdominal site.704SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nMale Infertility\\nThe morphologic pattern of testicular atrophy described\\nabove for cryptorchidism can result from various othercauses of male infertility. These causes can be divided into 3groups: pre-testicular, testicular and post-testicular.\\nA. PRE-TESTICULAR CAUSES:\\n1. Hypopituitarism.  Pre-pubertal or post-pubertal hypo-\\npituitarism such as from tumour, trauma, infarction, cyst and\\ngenetic deficiency of FSH and LH secretion.\\n2. Oestrogen excess.  Endogenous  excess such as from hepatic\\ncirrhosis, adrenal tumour, Sertoli and Leydig cell tumour;\\nor exogenous excess such as in the treatment of carcinoma of\\nthe prostate.\\n3.Glucocorticoid excess. Endogenous  excess may occur in\\nCushing’s syndrome while exogenous  excess may occur in\\nthe treatment of ulcerative colitis, bronchial asthma,\\nrheumatoid arthritis etc.\\n4\\n. Other endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism and\\ndiabetes mellitus are associated with hypospermatogenesis.B. TESTICULAR CAUSES:\\n1. Agonadism  i.e. total absence of the testes.\\n2.Cryptorchidism  or undescended testis described above.\\n3. Maturation arrest  i.e. failure of spermatogenesis beyond\\none of the immature stages.\\n4.\\nHypospermatogenesis  i.e. presence of all the maturation\\nstages of spermatogenesis but in decreased number.5. Sertoli cell-only syndrome.  Congenital or acquired\\nabsence of all germ cells so that the seminiferous tubules are\\nlined by Sertoli cells only.\\n6. Klinefelter’s syndrome.  An XXY intersexuality charac-\\nterised by primary hypogonadism, azoospermia, gynaeco-\\nmastia, eunuchoid built and subnormal intelligence.\\n7. Mumps orchitis occurring as a complication of parotitis\\n(Chapter 19).8. Irradiation damage  resulting in permanent germ cell\\ndestruction.\\nC. POST-TESTICULAR CAUSES:\\n1. Congenital block  e.g. absence or atresia of vas deferens.Figure 23.1 Microscopic appearance of normal testis (A) contrasted\\nwith that of cryptorchid testis (B).\\n705CHAPTER 23 The Male Reproductive System and Prostate2. Acquired block e.g. due to gonorrhoea and surgical\\nintervention.\\n3. Impaired sperm motility  in the presence of normal sperm\\ncounts e.g. immotile cilia syndrome (Chapter 17).\\nINFLAMMATIONS\\nInflammation of the testis is termed as orchitis and of\\nepididymis is called as epididymitis; the latter being morecommon. A combination epididymo-orchitis may also occur.A few important types are described below.\\nNon-specific Epididymitis and Orchitis\\nNon-specific epididymitis and orchitis, or their combination,\\nmay be acute or chronic. The common routes of spread ofinfection are via the vas deferens, or via lymphatic andhaematogenous routes. Most frequently, the infection iscaused by urethritis, cystitis, prostatitis and seminalvesiculitis. Other causes are mumps, smallpox, dengue fever,influenza, pneumonia and filariasis. The common infectingorganisms in sexually-active men under 35 years of age areNeisseria gonorrhoeae  and Chlamydia trachomatis, whereas in\\nolder individuals the common organisms are urinary tractpathogens like Escherichia coli  and Pseudomonas.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  in acute stage the\\ntesticle is firm, tense, swollen and congested. There maybe multiple abscesses, especially in gonorrhoeal infection.In chronic cases, there is usually variable degree ofatrophy and fibrosis.Histologically,  acute orchitis and epididymitis are charac-\\nterised by congestion, oedema and diffuse infiltration byneutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophagesor formation of neutrophilic abscesses. Acuteinflammation may resolve, or may progress to chronicform. In chronic epididymo-orchitis, there is focal ordiffuse chronic inflammation, disappearance ofseminiferous tubules, fibrous scarring and destruction ofinterstitial Leydig cells. Such cases usually result inpermanent sterility.\\nGranulomatous (Autoimmune) Orchitis\\nNon-tuberculous granulomatous orchitis is a peculiar type\\nof unilateral, painless testicular enlargement in middle-agedmen that may resemble a testicular tumour clinically. Theexact etiology and pathogenesis of the condition are notknown though an autoimmune basis is suspected.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the affected testis\\nis enlarged with thickened tunica. Cut section of thetesticle is greyish-white to tan-brown.Histologically,  there are circumscribed non-caseating\\ngranulomas lying within the seminiferous tubules. Thesegranulomas are composed of epithelioid cells, lympho-cytes, plasma cells, some neutrophils and multinucleategiant cells. The origin of the epithelioid cells is from Sertolicells lining the tubules. The tubules show peritubularfibrosis which merges into the interstitial tissue that isinfiltrated by lymphocytes and plasma cells.Tuberculous Epididymo-orchitis\\nTuberculosis invariably begins in the epididymis and\\nspreads to involve the testis. Tuberculous epididymo-orchitisis generally secondary tuberculosis from elsewhere in thebody. It may occur either by direct spread from genitourinarytuberculosis such as tuberculous seminal vesiculitis,prostatitis and renal tuberculosis, or may reach byhaematogenous spread of infection such as from tuberculosisof the lungs. Primary genital tuberculosis may occur rarely.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  discrete,\\nyellowish, caseous necrotic areas are seen.Microscopically, numerous tubercles which may coalesce\\nto form large caseous mass are seen. Characteristics oftypical tubercles such as epithelioid cells, peripheralmantle of lymphocytes, occasional multinucleate giantcells and central areas of caseation necrosis are seen(Fig. 23.2) . Numerous acid-fast bacilli can be\\ndemonstrated by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. The lesionsproduce extensive destruction of the epididymis and mayform chronic discharging sinuses on the scrotal skin. Inlate stage, the lesions heal by fibrous scarring and mayundergo calcification.\\nSpermatic Granuloma\\nSpermatic granuloma is the term used for development of\\ninflammatory lesions due to invasion of spermatozoa intothe stroma. Spermatic granuloma may develop due totrauma, inflammation and loss of ligature following\\nvasectomy.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the sperm granu-\\nloma is a small nodule, 3 mm to 3 cm in diameter, firm,\\nwhite to yellowish-brown.\\nFigure 23.2 Tuberculous epididymo-orchitis. The interstitium\\ncontains several epithelioid cell granulomas with central areas of\\ncaseation necrosis. These granulomas are surrounded by  Langhans’giant cells and mantle of lymphocytes.\\n706SECTION III Systemic PathologyHistologically,  it consists of a granuloma composed of\\nhistiocytes, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes and some\\nneutrophils. Characteristically, the centre of spermaticgranuloma contains spermatozoa and necrotic debris. Thelate lesions have fibroblastic proliferation at the peripheryand hyalinisation.\\nElephantiasis\\nElephantiasis is enormous thickening of the scrotal skin\\nresembling the elephant’s hide and results in enlargementof the scrotum. The condition results from filariasis in whichthe adult worm lives in the lymphatics, while the larvaetravel in the blood. The most important variety of filaria isWuchereria bancrofti.  The condition is common in all tropical\\ncountries. The vector is generally the Culex mosquito. Thepatients may remain asymptomatic or may manifest withfever, local pain, swelling, rash, tender lymphadenopathyand blood eosinophilia. An asthma-like respiratory comp-laint may develop in some cases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the affected leg\\nand scrotum are enormously thickened with enlargementof regional lymph nodes. The affected area of skin mayshow dilated dermal lymphatics and varicosities.Histologically,  the changes begin with lymphatic\\nobstruction by the adult worms. The worm in alive, deador calcified form may be found in the dilated lymphaticsor in the lymph nodes. Dead or calcified worm inlymphatics is usually followed by lymphangitis withintense infiltration by eosinophils. Sometimes,granulomatous reaction may be evident. In advancedcases, chronic lymphoedema with tough subcutaneousfibrosis and epidermal hyperkeratosis develops which istermed elephantiasis.\\nMISCELLANEOUS LESIONS\\nTorsion of T estis\\nTorsion of the testicle may occur either in a fully-descended\\ntestis or in an undescended testis. The latter is more commonand more severe. It results from sudden cessation of venousdrainage and arterial supply to the testis, usually followingsudden muscular effort or physical trauma. Torsion iscommon in boys and young men.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The pathologic changes\\nvary depending upon the duration and severity ofvascular occlusion. There may be coagulative necrosis ofthe testis and epididymis, or there may be haemorrhagicinfarction. The inflammatory reaction is generally not sopronounced.\\nV\\naricocele\\nVaricocele is the dilatation, elongation and tortuosity of theveins of the pampiniform plexus in the spermatic cord. It isof 2 types: primary (idiopathic) and secondary.\\nPrimary or idiopathic form is more frequent and is\\ncommon in young unmarried men. It is nearly always onthe left side as the loaded rectum presses the left vein.Besides, the left spermatic vein enters the renal vein at rightangles while the right spermatic vein enters the vena cavaobliquely.\\nSecondary form occurs due to pressure on the spermatic\\nvein by enlarged liver, spleen or kidney. It is commoner inmiddle-aged people.\\nHydrocele\\nA hydrocele is abnormal collection of serous fluid in the\\ntunica vaginalis. It may be acute or chronic, congenital oracquired. The usual causes are trauma, systemic oedemasuch as in cardiac failure and renal disease, and as acomplication of gonorrhoea, syphilis and tuberculosis.\\nThe hydrocele fluid is generally clear and straw-coloured\\nbut may be slightly turbid or haemorrhagic. The hydrocelesac may have single loculus or may have multiple loculi. Thewall of the hydrocele sac is composed of fibrous tissueinfiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells.\\nHaematocele\\nHaematocele is haemorrhage into the sac of the tunica\\nvaginalis. It may result from direct trauma, from injury to avein by the needle, or from haemorrhagic diseases.\\nIn recent haematocele, the blood coagulates and the wall\\nis coated with ragged deposits of fibrin. In long-standingcases, the tunica vaginalis is thickened with dense fibroustissue and occasionally may get partly calcified (Fig. 23.3) .\\nTESTICULAR TUMOURS\\nTesticular tumours are the cause of about 1% of all cancer\\ndeaths. They are more frequent in white male populationbut are less common in Africans and Asians. They havetrimodal  age distribution—a peak during infancy, another\\nduring late adolescence and early adulthood, and a thirdpeak after 60 years of age.\\nFigure 23.3 Haematocele testis. Sectioned surface of the sac shows\\nthick wall coated internally by brownish, tan and necrotic material which\\nis organised blood clot (arrow).707CHAPTER 23 The Male Reproductive System and ProstateCLASSIFICATION\\nThe most widely accepted classification is the histogenetic\\nclassification proposed by the World Health Organisation(Table 23.1). Based on this, all testicular tumours are dividedinto 3 groups: germ cell tumours, sex cord-stromal tumours  and\\nmixed forms.  Vast majority of the testicular tumours (95%)\\narise from germ cells or their precursors in the seminiferoustubules, while less than 5% originate from sex cord-stromalcomponents of the testis. From clinical point of view, germcell tumours of the testis are categorised into 2 main groups—seminomatous and non-seminomatous which need to bedistinguished (Table 23.2).\\nETIOLOGIC F AC\\nTORS\\nExact etiology of testicular germ cell tumours is unknown,but the following factors have been implicated:\\n1. Cryptorchidism.  The probability of a germ cell tumour\\ndeveloping in an undescended testis is 30-50 times greater\\nthan in a normally-descended testis. About 10% of testiculargerm cell tumours are associated with cryptorchidism. Thehigh incidence is attributed to higher temperature to whichthe undescended testis in the groin or abdomen is exposed.Intra-abdominal testis is at greater risk than the inguinaltestis. There is increased incidence of tumour in the contra-lateral normally-descended testis. There are no data toconfirm or deny whether surgical repositioning ororchiopexy of a cryptorchid testis alters the incidence oftesticular tumour. However, surgical correction is still helpfulsince it is easier to detect the tumour in scrotal testis than inan abdominal or inguinal testis.\\n2.\\nOther developmental disorders.  Dysgenetic gonads\\nassociated with endocrine abnormalities such as androgen\\ninsensitivity syndrome have higher incidence ofdevelopment of germ cell tumours.\\n3. Genetic factors.  Genetic factors play a role in the develop-\\nment of germ cell tumours supported by the observation of\\nhigh incidence in first-degree family members, twins and inwhite male populations while blacks in Africa have a verylow incidence. However, no definite pattern of inheritancehas been recognised.\\n4. Other factors.  A few less common factors include the\\nfollowing:\\ni)Orchitis.  A history of mumps or other forms of orchitis\\nmay be given by the patient with germ cell tumour.\\ni\\ni) Trauma.  Many patients give a history of trauma prior to\\nthe development of the tumour but it is not certain how\\ntrauma initiates the neoplastic process. Instead, possibly itbrings the patient to attention of the physician.\\niii)Carcinogens.  A number of carcinogens such as use of\\ncertain drugs (e.g. LSD, hormonal therapy for sterility,\\ncopper, zinc etc), exposure to radiation and endocrine abnor-malities may play a role in the development of testiculartumours.\\nHISTOGENESIS\\nPathogenesis of testicular tumours remains controversial\\nexcept that vast majority of these tumours originate fromgerm cells. Based on current concepts on histogenesis oftesticular tumours, following agreements and disagreementshave emerged (Fig. 23.4) :\\n1. Developmental disorders.  Disorders such as cryptor-\\nchidism, gonadal dysgenesis and androgen insensitivitysyndrome are high risk factors for development of testiculargerm cell tumours. These observations point to develop-mental defect in gonadogenesis.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 23.1: Classification of Testicular Tumours.\\nI. GERM CELL TUMOURS\\n1.

Testicular germ cell tumours\\nhave been found to have several genetic abnormalities\\nsuggesting a common molecular pathogenesis of  all germcell tumours:i) Hyperdiploidy is almost a constant feature of all germ cell\\ntumours of the testis.ii) In more than 90% of testicular germ cell tumoursirrespective of histologic type (as also ovarian germ celltumours), an isochromosome of short arm of chromosome12, abbreviated as i(12p), is found.\\niii) Similarly, deletion of long arm of chromosome 12abbreviated as del(12q) , is present.\\niv) Telomerase activity  is present in all germ cell tumours of\\nthe testis.v) Other mutations include p53, cyclin E  and FAS gene.\\n3. CIS/ITGCN. A preinvasive stage of carcinoma in situ\\n(CIS) termed intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) generally\\nprecedes the development of most of the invasive testiculargerm cell tumours in adults. CIS originates from spermato-genic elements. Areas of CIS are found in seminiferoustubules adjacent to most seminomas, embryonal carcinomasand other mixed germ cell tumours. However, CIS is notfound in seminiferous tubules adjoining yolk sac carcinomaof childhood, benign teratoma in children and adolescents,and spermatocytic seminoma indicating their different patho-genetic mechanisms.4. ‘Three hit’ process.  Germ cells in seminiferous tubules\\nundergo activation (‘first hit’) before undergoing malignant\\ntransformation confined to seminiferous tubules (CIS)(‘second hit’)  and eventually into invasive stage by some\\nepigenetic phenomena (‘third hit’).  Though this sequential\\ntumorigenesis explains the development of seminomatoustumours, it is yet not clear whether non-seminomatous germcell tumours develop directly or through intermediate stage.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS\\nThe usual presenting clinical symptoms of testicular tumours\\nare gradual gonadal enlargement and a dragging sensationin the testis. Metastatic involvement may produce secondarysymptoms such as pain, lymphadenopathy, haemoptysis andurinary obstruction.\\nSPREAD.  Since testicular germ cell tumours originate from\\ntotipotent germ cells, it is not unusual to find metastases of\\nhistologic types different from the primary growth. Testiculartumours may spread by both lymphatic and haematogenousroutes:\\nLymphatic spread  occurs to retroperitoneal para-aortic\\nlymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes and supraclavicularlymph nodes.\\nHaematogenous spread  primarily occurs to the lungs, liver,\\nbrain and bones.Figure 23.4 Schematic diagram showing histogenesis of testicular tumours.\\n709CHAPTER 23 The Male Reproductive System and ProstateTUMOUR MARKERS.  Germ cell tumours of the testis\\nsecrete polypeptide hormones and certain enzymes which\\ncan be detected in the blood. Two tumour markers widelyused in the diagnosis, staging and monitoring the follow-upof patients with testicular tumours are: human chorionicgonadotropin (hCG) and alpha-foetoprotein (AFP). Inaddition, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), human placentallactogen (HPL), placental alkaline phosphatase, testosterone,oestrogen and luteinising hormone may also be elevated.\\nhCG  is synthesised by placental syncytio-trophoblast\\nsuch as in various non-seminomatous germ cell tumours ofthe testis (e.g. in choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumour andembryonal carcinoma). However, ectopic hCG productionmay occur in a variety of non-testicular non-germ celltumours as well.\\nAFP  is normally synthesised by the foetal liver cells, yolk\\nsac and foetal gut. Its levels are elevated in testicular tumoursassociated with yolk sac components. However, elevatedserum AFP levels are also found in liver cell carcinoma.\\nPROGNOSIS.  For selecting post-orchiectomy treatment\\n(radiation, surgery, chemotherapy or all the three) and for\\nmonitoring prognosis, 3 clinical stages are defined:\\nStage I:  tumour confined to the testis.\\nStage II:  distant spread confined to retroperitoneal lymph\\nnodes below the diaphragm.\\nStage III:  distant metastases beyond the retroperitoneal\\nlymph nodes.\\nSeminomas tend to remain localised to the testis (stage\\nI) while non-seminomatous germ cell tumours more often\\npresent with advanced clinical disease (stage II and III).Seminomas are extremely radiosensitive while non-seminomatous germ cell tumours are radio-resistant. Ingeneral, seminomas have a better prognosis with 90% curerate while the non-seminomatous tumours behave in a moreaggressive manner and have poor prognosis.\\nAfter these general comments, specific testicular tumours\\nare as described below.\\nGERM CELL TUMOURS\\nGerm cell tumours comprise approximately 95% of all\\ntesticular tumours and are more frequent before the age of45 years. Testicular germ cell tumours are almost always\\nmalignant.  Nearly half of them contain more than one\\nhistologic type. Germ cell tumours are also found at theextragonadal sites such as the retroperitoneum and media-stinum, besides their counterparts in the female gonads (page745).\\nIntratubular Germ Cell Neoplasia\\nThe term intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) is used\\nto describe the preinvasive stage of germ cell tumours,notably intratubular seminoma and intratubular embryonalcarcinoma. Others have used carcinoma in situ  (CIS) stage\\nof germ cell tumours as synonymous term.\\nHistologically,  the malignant atypical tumour cells are\\nrestricted to the seminiferous tubules without evidentinvasion into the interstitium.\\nClassic Seminoma\\nSeminoma is the commonest malignant tumour of the testis\\nand corresponds to dysgerminoma in the female (page 747).It constitutes about 45% of all germ cell tumours, and inanother 15% comprises the major component of mixed germcell tumour. Seminoma is divided into 2 main categories:classic and spermatocytic. Classic seminoma comprises about93% of all seminomas and has a peak incidence in the 4thdecade of life and is rare before puberty. Undescended testisharbours seminoma more frequently as compared to othergerm cell tumours. About 10% pure seminomas areassociated with elevated hCG levels in serum.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the involved\\ntestis is enlarged up to 10 times its normal size but tendsto maintain its normal contour since the tumour rarelyinvades the tunica. The larger tumour replaces the entiretestis, whereas the smaller tumour appears ascircumscribed mass in the testis. Cut section of the affectedtestis shows homogeneous, grey-white lobulatedappearance (Fig. 23.5) . Necrosis and haemorrhage in the\\ntumour are rare.Microscopically,  the tumour has the following charac-\\nteristics  (Fig. 23.6) :\\nFigure 23.5 Seminoma testis. The testis is enlarged but without\\ndistorting its contour. Sectioned surface shows replacement of the entire\\ntestis by lobulated, homogeneous, grey-white mass.\\n710SECTION III Systemic Pathology1. Tumour cells.  The seminoma cells generally lie in cords,\\nsheets or columns forming lobules. Typically, in a classic\\nseminoma, the tumour cells are fairly uniform in size withclear cytoplasm and well-defined cell borders. The cyto-plasm contains variable amount of glycogen that stainspositively with PAS reaction. The nuclei are centrallylocated, large, hyperchromatic and usually contain 1-2prominent nucleoli. Tumour giant cells may be present.Mitotic figures are infrequent. However, about 10% ofseminomas have increased mitotic activity and haveaggressive behaviour and are categorised as anaplastic\\nseminomas.\\n2. Stroma.  The stroma of seminoma is delicate fibrous\\ntissue which divides the tumour into lobules. The stroma\\nshows a characteristic lymphocytic infiltration, indicativeof immunologic response of the host to the tumour. About20% of the tumours show granulomatous reaction in thestroma.\\nThe prognosis  of classic seminoma is better than other\\ngerm cell tumours. The tumour is highly radiosensitive.Natural history of anaplastic seminoma, however, isunclear—perhaps it represents an advanced stage of classicseminoma with a more aggressive behaviour.\\nSpermatocytic Seminoma\\nSpermatocytic seminoma is both clinically and\\nmorphologically a distinctive tumour from classic seminomaand is, therefore, classified separately in the WHOclassification. It is an uncommon tumour having an incidenceof about 5% of all germ cell tumours. Spermatocyticseminoma usually occurs in older patients, generally in 6thdecade of life. The tumour is bilateral in 10% of patients.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, spermatocytic\\nseminoma is homogeneous, larger, softer and moreyellowish and gelatinous than the classic seminoma.Histologically, the distinctive features are as under:\\n1. Tumour cells.  The tumour cells vary considerably in\\nsize from lymphocyte-like to huge mononucleate ormultinucleate giant cells. Majority of the tumour cells are,however, of intermediate size. The cells have eosinophiliccytoplasm devoid of glycogen. The nuclei of intermediateand large cells have filamentous pattern. Mitoses are oftenfrequent.\\n2. Stroma.  The stroma lacks lymphocytic and granulo-\\nmatous reaction seen in classic seminoma.\\nThe prognosis  of spermatocytic seminoma is excellent\\ncompared and better than classic seminoma since the tumour\\nis slow-growing and rarely metastasises. The tumour isradiosensitive.\\nEmbryonal Carcinoma\\nPure embryonal carcinoma constitutes 30% of germ cell\\ntumours but areas of embryonal carcinoma are present in40% of germ cell tumours. These tumours are more commonin 2nd to 3rd decades of life. About 90% cases are associatedwith elevation of AFP or hCG or both. They are moreaggressive than the seminomas.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  embryonal carci-\\nnoma is usually a small tumour in the testis. It distortsthe contour of the testis as it frequently invades the tunicaand the epididymis. Cut surface of the tumour is grey-white, soft with areas of haemorrhages and necrosis.Microscopically,  the following features are seen:\\n1. The tumour cells are arranged in a variety of patterns —\\nglandular, tubular, papillary and solid.\\n2.\\nThe tumour cells are highly anaplastic carcinomatous\\ncells having large size, indistinct cell borders, amphophilic\\ncytoplasm and prominent hyperchromatic nuclei showingconsiderable variation in nuclear size. Mitotic figures andFigure 23.6 Seminoma testis. Microscopy of the tumour shows lobules of monomorphic seminoma cells separated by delicate fibrous stroma\\ncontaining lymphocytic infiltration.\\n711CHAPTER 23 The Male Reproductive System and Prostatetumour giant cells are frequently present. Haemorrhage\\nand necrosis are common.\\n3. The stroma  is not as distinct as in seminoma and may\\ncontain variable amount of primitive mesenchyme.\\nEmbryonal carcinoma is more aggressive and less\\nradiosensitive than seminoma. Chemotherapy is more\\neffective in treating this tumour.\\nYolk Sac Tumour\\n(Synonyms: Endodermal Sinus T umour,\\nOrchioblastoma, Infantile Embryonal Carcinoma)\\nThis characteristic tumour is the most common testicular\\ntumour of infants and young children upto the age of 4 years.In adults, however, yolk sac tumour in pure form is rare butmay be present as the major component in 40% of germ celltumours. AFP levels are elevated in 100% cases of yolk sactumours.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is\\ngenerally soft, yellow-white, mucoid with areas of necrosisand haemorrhages.Microscopically, yolk sac tumour has the following\\nfeatures  (Fig. 23.7) :\\n1. The tumour cells form a variety of patterns— loose\\nreticular network, papillary, tubular and solid arrange-ment.2.The tumour cells  are flattened to cuboid epithelial cells\\nwith clear vacuolated cytoplasm.3.\\nThe tumour cells may form distinctive perivascular\\nstructures resembling the yolk sac or endodermal sinusesof the rat placenta called Schiller-Duval bodies.4. There may be presence of both intracellular andextracellular PAS-positive hyaline globules,  many of which\\ncontain AFP.\\nPolyembryoma\\nPolyembryoma is defined as a tumour composed predo-\\nminantly of embryoid bodies. Embryoid bodies are structures\\ncontaining a disc and cavities surrounded by loosemesenchyme simulating an embryo of about 2 weeks’gestation. Polyembryoma is extremely rare but embryoidbodies may be present with embryonal carcinoma andteratoma.\\nChoriocarcinoma\\nPure choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumour compo-\\nsed of elements consisting of syncytiotrophoblast andcytotrophoblast.\\nHowever, pure form is extremely rare and occurs more\\noften in combination with other germ cell tumours. Thepatients are generally in their 2nd decade of life. The primarytumour is usually small and the patient may manifest initiallywith symptoms of metastasis. The serum and urinary levelsof hCG are greatly elevated in 100% cases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is\\nusually small and may appear as a soft, haemorrhagic andnecrotic mass.Microscopically, the characteristic feature is the\\nidentification of intimately related syncytiotrophoblastand cytotrophoblast without formation of definiteplacental-type villi.\\nSyncytiotrophoblastic cells  are large with many irregular\\nand bizarre nuclei and abundant eosinophilic vacuolatedcytoplasm which stains positively for hCG. These cellsoften surround masses of cytotrophoblastic cells.\\nCytotrophoblastic cells  are polyhedral cells which are\\nmore regular and have clear or eosinophilic cytoplasmwith hyperchromatic nuclei.\\nTeratoma\\nTeratomas are complex tumours composed of tissues derived\\nfrom more than one of the three germ cell layers—endoderm,mesoderm and ectoderm. Testicular teratomas are morecommon in infants and children and constitute about 40%of testicular tumours in infants, whereas in adults theycomprise 5% of all germ cell tumours. However, teratomasare found in combination with other germ cell tumours (mostcommonly with embryonal carcinoma) in about 45% ofmixed germ cell tumours. About half the teratomas haveelevated hCG or AFP levels or both.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Testicular teratomas are\\nclassified into 3 types:1. Mature (differentiated) teratoma2. Immature teratoma3. Teratoma with malignant transformation.\\nFigure 23.7 Yolk sac tumour testis. The tumour has microcystic\\npattern and has highly anaplastic tumour cells. Several characteristic\\nSchiller-Duval bodies are present. Inset shows intra- and extracellularhyaline globules.\\n712SECTION III Systemic PathologyGrossly, most teratomas are large, grey-white masses\\nenlarging the involved testis. Cut surface shows\\ncharacteristic variegated appearance—grey-white solidareas, cystic and honey-combed areas, and foci of cartilageand bone (Fig. 23.8) . Dermoid tumours commonly seen\\nin the ovaries are rare in testicular teratomas.Microscopically,  the three categories of teratomas show\\ndifferent appearances:\\n1.Mature (differentiated) teratoma. Mature teratoma is\\ncomposed of disorderly mixture of a variety of well-\\ndifferentiated structures such as cartilage, smooth muscle,intestinal and respiratory epithelium, mucus glands, cystslined by squamous and transitional epithelium, neuraltissue, fat and bone. This type of mature or differentiatedteratoma is the most common, seen more frequently ininfants and children and has favourable prognosis.However, similar mature and benign-appearing tumourin adults is invariably associated with small hidden fociof immature elements so that their clinical course in adultsis unpredictable. It is believed that all testicular teratomas\\nin the adults are malignant.\\nAs mentioned above, dermoid cysts similar to those\\nof the ovary are rare in the testis.\\n2. Immature teratoma.  Immature teratoma is composed\\nof incompletely differentiated and primitive or embryonic\\ntissues along with some mature elements  (Fig. 23.9).\\nPrimitive or embryonic tissue commonly present arepoorly-formed cartilage, mesenchyme, neural tissues,abortive eye, intestinal and respiratory tissue elements etc.Mitoses are usually frequent.Figure 23.8 Immature teratoma testis. The testis is enlarged and nodular distorting the testicular contour. Sectioned surface shows replace ment\\nof the entire testis by variegated mass having grey-white solid areas, cystic areas, honey-combed areas and foci of cartilage and bone.\\nFigure 23.9 Immature teratoma testis. Microscopy shows a variety of incompletely differentiated tissue elements.\\n713CHAPTER 23 The Male Reproductive System and Prostate3. Teratoma  with malignant transformation. This is an\\nextremely rare form of teratoma in which one or more of\\nthe tissue elements show malignant transformation. Suchmalignant change resembles morphologically with typicalmalignancies in other organs and tissues and commonlyincludes rhabdomyosarcoma, squamous cell carcinomaand adenocarcinoma.\\nMixed Germ Cell Tumours\\nAbout 60% of germ cell tumours have more than one of the\\nabove histologic types (except spermatocytic seminoma) andare called mixed germ cell tumours. The clinical behaviourof these tumours is worsened by inclusion of more aggressivetumour component in a less malignant tumour. Interestingly,metastases of the mixed germ cell tumours may not exactlyreproduce the histologic types present in the primarytumour.\\nThe most common combinations of mixed germ cell\\ntumours are as under:1.Teratoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumour and\\nsyncytiotrophoblast.2.Embryonal carcinoma and teratoma (teratocarcinoma).\\n3.\\nSeminoma and embryonal carcinoma.\\nSEX CORD-STROMAL TUMOURS\\nTumours arising from specialised gonadal stroma are classi-\\nfied on the basis of histogenesis. The primitive mesenchymewhich forms the specialised stroma of gonads in either sexgives rise to theca, granulosa and lutein cells in the female,and Sertoli and interstitial Leydig cells in the male. Since thecell of origin of primitive mesenchyme is identical, Sertoliand interstitial Leydig cell tumours may occur in the ovaries(in addition to theca cell, granulosa cell and lutein celltumours). Likewise, the latter three tumours may occur inthe testis (in addition to Sertoli cell and Leydig cell tumours).All these tumours secrete various hormones. The biologicbehaviour of these tumours generally cannot be determinedon histological grounds alone but is related to clinicalparameters and hormonal elaboration by these tumours.\\nLeydig (Interstitial) Cell  Tumour\\nLeydig cell tumours are quite uncommon. They may occur\\nat any age but are more frequent in the age group of 20 to 50years. Characteristically, these cells secrete androgen, or bothandrogen and oestrogen, and rarely corticosteroids. Bilateraltumours may occur typically in congenital adrenogenitalsyndrome.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour\\nappears as a small, well-demarcated and lobulatednodule. Cut surface is homogeneously yellowish orbrown.Histologically,  the tumour is composed of sheets and\\ncords of normal-looking Leydig cells. These cells containabundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and Reinke’s crystalsand a small central nucleus.\\nMost of Leydig cell tumours are benign. Only about 10%\\nmay invade and metastasise.Sertoli Cell Tumours (Androblastoma)\\nSertoli cell tumours correspond to arrhenoblastoma of the\\novary. They may occur at all ages but are more frequent ininfants and children. These tumours may elaborate oestrogenor androgen and may account for gynaecomastia in an adult,or precocious sexual development in a child.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nfairly large, firm, round, and well circumscribed. Cutsurface of the tumour is yellowish or yellow-grey.Microscopically,  Sertoli cell tumour is composed of\\nbenign Sertoli cells arranged in well-defined tubules.\\nMajority of Sertoli cell tumours are benign but about 10%\\nmay metastasise to regional lymph nodes.\\nGranulosa Cell Tumour\\nThis is an extremely rare tumour in the testis and resembles\\nmorphologically with its ovarian counterpart (Chapter 24).\\nMIXED GERM CELL-SEX CORD STROMAL TUMOURS\\nAn example of combination of both germ cells and sex cord\\nstromal components is gonadoblastoma.\\nGonadoblastoma\\nDysgenetic gonads and undescended testis are predisposed\\nto develop such combined proliferations of germ cells andsex cord-stromal elements. The patients are commonlyintersexuals, particularly phenotypic females. Most of thegonadoblastomas secrete androgen and therefore producevirilisation in female phenotype. A few, however, secreteoestrogen.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is of\\nvariable size, yellowish-white and soft.Microscopically, gonadoblastoma is composed of 2\\nprincipal cell types—large germ cells resemblingseminoma cells, and small cells resembling immatureSertoli, Leydig and granulosa cells. Call-Exner bodies ofa granulosa cell tumour may be present.\\nPrognosis largely depends upon the malignant potential\\nof the type of germ cell components included.\\nOTHER TUMOURSMalignant L ymphoma\\nMalignant lymphomas comprises 5% of testicular malignan-\\ncies and is the most common testicular tumour in the elderly.Bilaterality is seen in half the cases. Most common are largecell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of B cell type.\\nRare T umours\\nIn addition to the testicular tumours described above, some\\nother uncommon tumours in this location include: plasma-cytoma, leukaemic infiltration, carcinoid tumour,haemangioma, primary sarcomas and metastatic tumours.714SECTION III Systemic PathologyPENIS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe penis is covered by skin, foreskin (prepuce) and strati-\\nfied squamous mucosa. The structure of penis consists of 3masses of erectile tissue— two corpora cavernosa, one oneach side dorsally, and the corpus spongiosum ventrallythrough which the urethra passes. The expanded free end ofthe corpus spongiosum forms the glans.\\nThe lumen of the urethra in sectioned surface of the penis\\nappears as an irregular cleft in the middle of the corpusspongiosum. In the prostatic part, it is lined by transitionalepithelium, but elsewhere it is lined by columnar epitheliumexcept near its orifice where stratified squamous epitheliumlines it.\\nCONGENITAL ANOMALIES\\nPhimosis\\nPhimosis is a condition in which the prepuce is too small to\\npermit its normal retraction behind the glans. It may becongenital or acquired. Congenital phimosis  is a developmental\\nanomaly whereas acquired phimosis  may result from\\ninflammation, trauma or oedema leading to narrowing ofpreputial opening. In either case, phimosis interferes withcleanliness and predisposes to the development of secondaryinfection, preputial calculi and squamous cell carcinoma.\\nParaphimosis is a condition in which the phimotic pre-\\npuce is forcibly retracted resulting in constriction over theglans penis and subsequent swelling.\\nHypospadias and Epispadias\\nHypospadias  is a developmental defect of the urethra in which\\nthe urethral meatus fails to reach the end of the penis, but\\ninstead, opens on the ventral surface of the penis. Similardevelopmental defect with resultant urethral opening on thedorsal surface of the penis is termed epispadias.  Hypospadias\\nand epispadias may cause urethral constriction withconsequent infection and may also interfere with normalejaculation and insemination. Both these urethral anomaliesare more frequently associated with cryptorchidism.\\nINFLAMMATIONS\\nGlans and prepuce are frequently involved in inflammation\\nin a number of specific and non-specific conditions. Thespecific inflammations include various sexually-transmitteddiseases such as hard chancre in syphilis, chancroid causedby Haemophilus ducreyi , gonorrhoea caused by gonococci,\\nherpes progenitalis, granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), andlymphopathia venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.\\nBalanoposthitis\\nBalanoposthitis is the term used for non-specific inflam-\\nmation of the inner surface of the prepuce (balanitis)  and\\nadjacent surface of the glans (posthitis).  It is caused by a\\nvariety of microorganisms such as staphylococci,streptococci, coliform bacilli and gonococci. Balanoposthitisusually results from lack of cleanliness resulting inaccumulation of secretions and smegma. It is a commonaccompaniment of phimosis. The type of inflammation maybe acute or chronic, sometimes with ulceration on themucosal surface of the glans.\\nBalanitis Xerotica Obliterans\\nBalanitis xerotica obliterans is a white atrophic lesion on the\\nglans penis and the prepuce and is a counterpart of the lichen\\nsclerosus et atrophicus in the vulva described on page 721.\\nTUMOURS\\nBenign and malignant tumours as well as certain premalig-\\nnant lesions may occur on the penis. These are discussedbelow:\\nBENIGN  TUMOURS\\nCondyloma Acuminatum\\nCondyloma acuminatum or anogenital wart is a benign\\ntumour caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6and 11. The tumour may occur singly, or there may beconglomerated papillomas. A more extensive, solitary,exophytic and cauliflower-like warty mass is termed giant\\ncondyloma or Buschke-Löwenstein tumour or verrucouscarcinoma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The condyloma is\\ncommonly located on the coronal sulcus on the penis orthe perineal area.Grossly,  the tumour consists of solitary or multiple, warty,\\ncauliflower-shaped lesions of variable size with exophyticgrowth pattern.Histologically, the lesions are essentially like common\\nwarts (verruca vulgaris). The features include formationof papillary villi composed of connective tissue stromaand covered by squamous epithelium which showshyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and hyperplasia of pricklecell layer. Many of the prickle cells show clearvacuolisation of the cytoplasm ( koilocytosis ) indicative of\\nHPV infection.\\nGiant condyloma  shows upward as well as downward\\ngrowth of the tumour but is otherwise histologically identi-cal to condyloma acuminatum. Though histologically benign,clinically the giant condyloma is associated with recurrencesand behaves as intermediate between truly benigncondyloma acuminatum and squamous cell carcinoma.\\nPREMALIGNANT LESIONS (CARCINOMA IN SITU)\\nIn the region of external male genitalia, three lesions display\\ncytological changes of malignancy confined to epitheliallayers  only without evidence of invasion. These conditions\\nare: Bowen’s disease, erythroplasia of Queyrat and bowenoidpapulosis.\\nBowen’s Disease\\nBowen’s disease is located on the shaft of the penis and the\\nscrotum besides the sun-exposed areas of the skin (page 782).715CHAPTER 23 The Male Reproductive System and ProstateGrossly,  it appears as a solitary, circumscribed plaque\\nlesion with ulceration.\\nHistologically,  the changes are superficial to the dermo-\\nepidermal border. The epithelial cells of the epidermisshow hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis andscattered bizarre dyskeratotic cells.\\nA fair proportion of cases of Bowen’s disease are\\nassociated with internal visceral cancers.\\nErythroplasia of Queyrat\\nThe lesions of erythroplasia of Queyrat appear on the penile\\nmucosa.\\nGrossly,  the lesions are pink, shiny and velvety soft.\\nHistologically, the thickened and acanthotic epidermis\\nshows variable degree of dysplasia.\\nUnlike Bowen’s disease, there is no relationship\\nbetween erythroplasia of Queyrat and internalmalignancy.Bowenoid Papulosis\\nThe lesions of bowenoid papulosis appear on the penile shaft\\nand adjacent genital skin.\\nGrossly, they are solitary or multiple, shiny, red-brown\\npapular lesions.Histologically, there is orderly maturation of epithelial\\ncells in hyperplastic epidermis with scattered hyper-chromatic nuclei and dysplastic cells.\\nMALIGNANT  TUMOURS\\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma\\nThe incidence of penile carcinoma shows wide variation in\\ndifferent populations. In the United States, the overallincidence of penile cancer is less than 1% of all cancers inmales but it is 3-4 times more common in blacks than inwhites. In some Asian, African and Latin American countries,its incidence is about 10% of all cancers. Relationship ofpenile cancer with HPV has been well supported; high-riskFigure 23.10 Carcinoma of the penis. Diagrammatic representation of flat-ulcerating (A) and cauliflower papillary (B) patterns of growth at\\ncommon locations. C, Amputated specimen of the penis shows a cauliflower growth on the coronal sulcus (arrow). The surface of t he growth is\\nulcerated and is chalky-white in appearance.\\nFigure 23.11 Squamous cell carcinoma penis. Microscopy shows whorls of malignant squamous cells with central keratin pearls.\\n716SECTION III Systemic PathologyHPV types 16 and 18 are strongly implicated and their DNA\\nhas been documented in the nuclei of malignant cells.Carcinoma of the penis is quite rare in Jews and Muslimswho undergo a ritual of circumcision early in life. In India,cancer of the penis is rare in Muslims who practice circum-cision as a religious rite in infancy, whereas Hindus who donot normally circumcise have higher incidence. Circumcisionprovides protection against penile cancer due to preventionof accumulation of smegma which is believed to becarcinogenic. The greatest incidence of penile cancer isbetween 45 and 60 years.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the tumour is\\nlocated, in decreasing frequency, on frenum, prepuce,glans and coronal sulcus. The tumour may be cauliflower-like and papillary, or flat and ulcerating (Fig. 23.10) .\\nHistologically, squamous cell carcinoma of both\\nfungating and ulcerating type is generally well differen-tiated to moderately-differentiated type which resemblesin morphology to similar cancer elsewhere in the body(Fig. 23.11) .\\nThe tumour metastasises via lymphatics to regional\\nlymph nodes. Visceral metastases by haematogenous routeare uncommon and occur in advanced cases only.\\nPROSTATE\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe prostate gland in the normal adult weighs approximately\\n20 gm. It surrounds the commencement of the male urethraand is composed of 5 lobes during embryonic development—anterior, middle, posterior and two lateral lobes. But at birth,the five lobes fuse to form 3 distinct lobes—two major laterallobes and a small median lobe (Fig. 23.12,A) .\\nHistologically,  the prostate is composed of tubular alveoli\\n(acini) embedded in fibromuscular tissue mass. Theglandular epithelium forms infoldings and consists of 2layers—a basal layer of low cuboidal cells and an inner layerof mucus-secreting tall columnar cells. The alveoli areseparated by thick fibromuscular septa containing abundantsmooth muscle fibres.\\nFigure 23.12 Normal prostate, benign nodular hyperplasia and prostatic carcinoma. The nodule in case of benign nodular hyperplasia (B) is\\nlocated in the inner periurethral part and compresses the prostatic urethra while prostatic carcinoma (C) generally arises in t he peripheral glands\\nand, thus, does not compress the urethra.The prostate has numerous blood vessels and nerves. In\\naddition to nervous control, the prostate is an endocrine-dependent organ. Based on hormonal responsiveness, theprostate is divided into 2 separate parts:\\nthe inner periurethral female part which is sensitive to\\noestrogen and androgen; and\\nouter subcapsular true male part  which is sensitive to\\nandrogen.\\nProstate is involved in 3 important pathologic processes:\\nprostatitis, nodular hyperplasia and carcinoma. While benignnodular hyperplasia occurs in the periurethral part distortingand compressing the centrally located urethral lumen, theprostatic carcinoma usually arises from the outer subcapsularpart in which case it does not compress the urethra(Figs. 23.12, B, C) .\\nPROSTATITIS\\nInflammation of the prostate i.e. prostatitis, may be acute,\\nchronic and granulomatous types.\\nAcute Prostatitis\\nAcute focal or diffuse suppurative inflammation of the\\nprostate is not uncommon. It occurs most commonly due toascent of bacteria from the urethra, less often by descent fromthe upper urinary tract or bladder, and occasionally bylymphogenous or haematogenous spread from a distantfocus of infection. The infection may occur spontaneouslyor may be a complication of urethral manipulation such asby catheterisation, cystoscopy, urethral dilatation andsurgical procedures on the prostate. The common pathogensare those which cause UTI, most frequently E. coli,  and others\\nsuch as Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter,  gono-\\ncocci, staphylococci and streptococci. The diagnosis is madeby culture of urine specimen.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the prostate is\\nenlarged, swollen and tense. Cut section shows multipleabscesses and foci of necrosis.Histologically,  the prostatic acini are dilated and filled\\nwith neutrophilic exudate. There may be diffuse acute\\n717CHAPTER 23 The Male Reproductive System and Prostateinflammatory infiltrate. Oedema, hyperaemia and foci of\\nnecrosis frequently accompany acute inflammatoryinvolvement.\\nChronic Prostatitis\\nChronic prostatitis is more common and foci of chronic\\ninflammation are frequently present in the prostate of menabove 40 years of age. Chronic prostatitis is usuallyasymptomatic but may cause allergic reactions, iritis, neuritisor arthritis.\\nChronic prostatitis is of 2 types—bacterial and abacterial.\\nChronic bacterial prostatitis  is caused in much the same\\nway and by the same organisms as the acute prostatitis. It is\\ngenerally a consequence of recurrent UTI. Diagnosis is madeby detection of more than 10-12 leucocytes per high powerfield in expressed prostatic secretions, and by positive cultureof urine specimen and prostatic secretions. This condition ismore difficult to treat since antibiotics penetrate the prostatepoorly.\\nChronic abacterial prostatitis  is more common. There is\\nno history of recurrent UTI and culture of urine and prostaticsecretions is always negative, though leucocytosis isdemonstrable in prostatic secretions. The pathogensimplicated are Chlamydia trachomatis  and Ureaplasma\\nurealyticum.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Pathologic changes in\\nboth bacterial and abacterial prostatitis are similar.Grossly, the prostate may be enlarged, fibrosed and\\nshrunken.Histologically,  the diagnosis of chronic prostatitis is made\\nby foci of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages andneutrophils within the prostatic substance. Corporaamylacea, prostatic calculi and foci of squamousmetaplasia in the prostatic acini may accompanyinflammatory changes. Seminal vesicles are invariablyinvolved.\\nGranulomatous Prostatitis\\nGranulomatous prostatitis is a variety of chronic prostatitis,\\nprobably caused by leakage of prostatic secretions into thetissue, or could be of autoimmune origin.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the gland is firm\\nto hard, giving the clinical impression of prostaticcarcinoma on rectal examination.Histologically, the inflammatory reaction consists of\\nmacrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and somemultinucleate giant cells. The condition may be confusedwith tuberculous prostatitis.\\nNODULAR HYPERPLASIA\\nNon-neoplastic tumour-like enlargement of the prostate,\\ncommonly termed benign nodular hyperplasia (BNH) orbenign enlargement of prostate (BEP), is a very commoncondition in men and considered by some as normal ageingprocess. It becomes increasingly more frequent above the ageof 50 years and its incidence approaches 75-80% in men above80 years. However, symptomatic BEP producing urinary tractobstruction and requiring surgical treatment occurs in 5-10%of cases only.\\nETIOLOGY.  The cause of BEP has not been fully established.\\nHowever, a few etiologic factors such as endocrinologic, racial,\\ninflammation  and arteriosclerosis  have been implicated but\\nendocrine basis for hyperplasia has been more fully\\ninvestigated and considered a strong possibility in its genesis.It has been found that both sexes elaborate androgen andoestrogen, though the level of androgen is high in males andthat of oestrogen is high in females. With advancing age,there is decline in the level of androgen and a correspondingrise of oestrogen in the males. The periurethral inner prostatewhich is primarily involved in BEP is responsive to the risinglevel of oestrogen, whereas the outer prostate which is mainlyinvolved in the carcinoma is responsive to androgen. Aplausible hypothesis suggested is that there is synergisticstimulation of the prostate by both hormones—the oestrogen\\nacting to sensitise the prostatic tissue to the growthpromoting effect of dihydroxy-testosterone  derived from\\nplasma testosterone.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, the enlarged pro-\\nstate is nodular, smooth and firm and weighs 2-4 timesits normal weight i.e. may weigh up to 40-80 gm. Theappearance on cut section varies depending upon whetherthe hyperplasia is predominantly of the glandular orfibromuscular tissue (Fig. 23.13) . In primarily glandular BEP\\nthe tissue is yellow-pink, soft, honey-combed, and milkyfluid exudes, whereas in mainly fibromuscular BEP the cut\\nsurface is firm, homogeneous and does not exude milkyfluid. The hyperplastic nodule forms a mass mainly inthe inner periurethral prostatic gland so that thesurrounding prostatic tissue forms a false capsule whichenables the surgeon to enucleate the nodular masses. The\\nFigure 23.13 Nodular enlargement of the prostate. Sectioned\\nsurface of enlarged prostate shows soft to firm, grey-white, nodularity\\nwith microcystic areas.718SECTION III Systemic Pathologyleft-over peripheral prostatic tissue may sometimes\\nundergo recurrent nodular enlargement or may developcarcinoma later.Histologically,  in every case, there is hyperplasia of all\\nthree tissue elements in varying proportions—glandular,fibrous and muscular (Fig. 23.14) :\\nGlandular hyperplasia  predominates in most cases and\\nis identified by exaggerated intra-acinar papillaryinfoldings with delicate fibrovascular cores. The liningepithelium is two-layered: the inner tall columnar mucus-secreting with poorly-defined borders, and the outercuboidal to flattened epithelium with basal nuclei.\\nFibromuscular hyperplasia  when present as dominant\\ncomponent appears as aggregates of spindle cells formingan appearance akin to fibromyoma of the uterus.\\nIn addition to glandular and/or fibromuscular\\nhyperplasia, other histologic features frequently foundinclude foci of lymphocytic aggregates, small areas ofinfarction, corpora amylacea and foci of squamousmetaplasia.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinically, the symptomatic cases\\ndevelop symptoms due to complications such as urethralobstruction and secondary effects on the bladder (e.g.hypertrophy, cystitis), ureter (e.g. hydroureter) and kidneys(e.g. hydronephrosis). The presenting features includefrequency, nocturia, difficulty in micturition, pain,haematuria and sometimes, the patients present with acuteretention of urine requiring immediate catheterisation.\\nCARCINOMA OF PROSTATE\\nCancer of the prostate is the second most common form of\\ncancer in males, followed in frequency by lung cancer. It is adisease of men above the age of 50 years and its prevalenceincreases with increasing age so that more than 50% of men80 years old have asymptomatic (latent) carcinoma of theprostate. Many a times, carcinoma  of the prostate is smalland detected as microscopic foci in a prostate removed forBEP or found incidentally at autopsy. Thus, it is common toclassify carcinoma of the prostate into the following 4 types:\\n1. Latent carcinoma.  This is found unexpectedly as a small\\nfocus of carcinoma in the prostate during autopsy studies in\\nmen dying of other causes. Its incidence in autopsies has beenvariously reported as 25-35%.\\n2. Incidental carcinoma.  About 15-20% of prostatectomies\\ndone for BEP reveal incidental carcinoma of the prostate.\\n3.\\nOccult carcinoma.  This is the type in which the patient\\nhas no symptoms of prostatic carcinoma but shows evidence\\nof metastases on clinical examination and investigations.\\n4. Clinical carcinoma.  Clinical prostatic carcinoma is the\\ntype detected by rectal examination and other investigations\\nand confirmed by pathologic examination of biopsy of theprostate.\\nETIOLOGY.  The cause of prostatic cancer remains obscure.\\nHowever, a few factors have been suspected. These are as\\nunder:\\n1. Endocrinologic factors.  Androgens are considered\\nessential for development and maintenance of prostatic\\nepithelium. But how androgens are responsible for causingmalignant transformation is not yet clear. However, theetiologic role of androgens is supported by the followingindirect evidences:\\ni)Orchiectomy causes arrest of metastatic prostatic cancer\\ndisease (testis being the main source of testosterone).i\\ni) Administration of oestrogen causes regression of pros-\\ntatic carcinoma.iii) Cancer of the prostate is extremely rare in eunuchs and\\nin patients with Klinefelter’s syndrome.\\niv) Cancer of the prostate begins at the stage of life when\\nandrogen levels are high. However, the cancer may remainlatent with decline in androgen level with advancing age.\\n2. Racial and geographic influences.  There are some racial\\nand geographic differences in the incidence of prostaticFigure 23.14 Nodular hyperplasia of the prostate. There is hyperplasia of fibromuscular elements. There are areas of intra-acinar papillary\\ninfoldings (convolutions) lined by two layers of epithelium with basal polarity of nuclei.\\n719CHAPTER 23 The Male Reproductive System and Prostatecancer. It is uncommon in Japanese and Chinese, while the\\nprevalence is high in Americans. African Americans have amarkedly higher incidence as compared to whites which maybe related to genetic variation in androgen receptor gene.\\n3. Environmental influences.  Some common environ-\\nmental factors and carcinogens have been identified with\\nhigh risk to development of prostatic cancer. These includehigh dietary fat, and exposure to polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons. Flavonoids, antioxidants and selenium mayreduce the risk.\\n4. Nodular hyperplasia. Though nodular prostatic\\nhyperplasia has been suggested by some as precursor for\\ndevelopment of prostatic cancer, it is considered unlikely.Most prostatic cancers develop in the periphery of the glandwhile BEP occurs in the periurethral part of the gland. Anyconcomitant occurrence of the two diseases may beconsidered as aging process. Approximately 15-20% ofnodular hyperplastic prostates harbour carcinoma.\\n5. Heredity.  The possibility of genetic basis of prostatic\\ncancer has been suggested by the observations of familial\\nclustering and 2-fold higher frequency in first-degreerelatives.  Prostatic cancer susceptibility gene has beenidentified in familial cases.\\nHISTOGENESIS.  Histogenesis of prostatic adenocarcinoma\\nhas been documented as a mutistep process arising from\\npremalignant stage of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN).\\nPIN refers to multiple foci of cytologically atypical luminalcells overlying diminished number of basal cells in prostaticducts and is a forerunner of invasive prostatic carcinoma.Based on cytologic atypia, PIN may be low grade to highgrade. PIN of high-grade progresses to prostatic adeno-carcinoma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the prostate may\\nbe enlarged, normal in size or smaller than normal. In 95%of cases, prostatic carcinoma is located in the peripheralzone, especially in the posterior lobe. The malignantprostate is firm and fibrous. Cut section is homogeneousand contains irregular yellowish areas.Microscopically, 4 histologic types are described—\\nadenocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, squamouscell carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma. However,adenocarcinoma  is the most common type found in 96% of\\ncases and is the one generally referred to as carcinoma ofthe prostate. The other three histologic types are rare andresemble in morphology with similar malignant tumourselsewhere in the body.\\nThe histologic characteristics of adenocarcinoma of the\\nprostate are as under (Fig. 23.15) :\\n1.Architectural disturbance.  In contrast to convoluted\\nappearance of the glands seen in normal and hyperplasticprostate, there is loss of intra-acinar papillaryconvolutions. The groups of acini are either closely packedin back-to-back arrangement without intervening stromaor are haphazardly distributed.\\n2. Stroma.  Normally, fibromuscular sling surrounds the\\nacini, whereas malignant acini have little or no stroma\\nbetween them. The tumour cells may penetrate andreplace the fibromuscular stroma.\\n3.Gland pattern. Most frequently, the glands in well-\\ndifferentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma are small or\\nmedium-sized, lined by a single layer of cuboidal or lowcolumnar cells. Moderately-differentiated tumours havecribriform or fenestrated glandular appearance. Poorly-differentiated tumours have little or no glandular arrange-ment but instead show solid or trabecular pattern.\\n4.\\nTumour cells.  In many cases, the individual tumour\\ncells in prostatic carcinoma do not show usual\\nmorphologic features of malignancy. The tumour cellsmay be clear, dark and eosinophilic cells. Clear cells  have\\nfoamy cytoplasm, dark cells have homogeneous basophilic\\ncytoplasm, and eosinophilic cells  have granular cytoplasm.\\nThe cells may show varying degree of anaplasia andnuclear atypia but is generally slight.Figure 23.15 Carcinoma of the prostate. The field shows microacini of small malignant cells infiltrating the prostatic stroma. Inset in the\\nphotomicrograph shows perineural invasion by prostatic adenocarcinoma.\\n720SECTION III Systemic Pathology5. Invasion.  One of the important diagnostic features of\\nmalignancy in prostate is the early and frequent\\noccurrence of invasion of intra-prostatic perineural spaces.\\nLymphatic and vascular invasion may be present but aredifficult to detect.\\nSPREAD.  The tumour spreads within the gland by direct\\nextension, and to distant sites by metastases.\\nDirect spread.  Direct extension of the tumour occurs into\\nthe prostatic capsule and beyond. In late stage, the tumour\\nmay extend into the bladder neck, seminal vesicles, trigoneand ureteral openings.\\nMetastases. Distant spread occurs by both lymphatic and\\nhaematogenous routes. The rich lymphatic network\\nsurrounding the prostate is the main mode of spread to thesacral, iliac and para-aortic lymph nodes. The earliestmetastasis occur to the obturator lymph node. Haemato-genous spread leads most often to characteristic osteoblasticosseous metastases, especially to pelvis, and lumbar spine;\\nother sites of metastases are lungs, kidneys, breast and brain.The route of blood-borne metastases may be retrogradespread by prostatic venous plexus or via systemic circulation.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES. By the time symptoms appear, the\\ncarcinoma of prostate is usually palpable on rectal\\nexamination as a hard and nodular gland fixed to thesurrounding tissues. In such symptomatic cases, clinicalfeatures are: urinary obstruction with dysuria, frequency,retention of urine, haematuria, and in 10% of cases pain inthe back due to skeletal metastases.\\nClinical staging of carcinoma prostate takes into account\\nthe following:\\nThe tumour found incidentally or a clinically unsuspected\\ncancer in prostate removed for benign disorder (Stage A).\\nThe tumour palpable by rectal digital examination but\\nconfined to the prostate (Stage B).\\nThe tumour has extended locally beyond the prostate into\\nthe surrounding tissues (Stage  C).\\nThe tumour is associated with distant metastases\\n(Stage D).\\nClinical staging has good correlation with histologic\\ngrading and, thus, has a prognostic significance. Mostofi’s(WHO) histologic grading categorising prostate cancer into\\ngrade I (well-differentiated), grade II (moderatelydifferentiated) and grade III (poorly differentiated) haslargely been replaced with  Gleason’s microscopic grading\\nsystem  which is based on two features:\\ni) Degree of glandular differentiation.ii) Growth pattern of the tumour in relation to the stroma.\\nThese features are assessed by low-power examination\\nof the prostatic tissue.  For  clinical staging of prostate cancer,\\nTNM system  is considered international standard.\\nThe diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma is made by\\ncytologic, biochemical, radiologic, ultrasonographic andpathologic methods. However, definite diagnosis isestablished by histopathologic examination of transrectalultrasound (TRUS)- guided core needle biopsy.\\nTwo serum  tumour markers  employed commonly for\\ndiagnosis and monitoring the prognosis of prostaticcarcinoma are as under:\\nProstatic acid phosphatase (PAP)  is secreted by prostatic\\nepithelium. Elevation of serum level of PAP is found in casesof prostatic cancer which have extended beyond the capsuleor have metastasised. PAP can also be demonstrated in thenormal prostatic tissues.\\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA)  can be detected by\\nimmunohistochemical method in the malignant prostaticepithelium as well as estimated in the serum. A readingbetween 4 and 10 (normal 0-4 ng/ml) is highly suspicious(10% risk) but value above 10 is diagnostic of prostatic carci-noma. PSA assay is useful in deciding whether the metastasisoriginated from the prostate or not. PSA assay is also helpfulin distinguishing high-grade prostatic cancer from urothelialcarcinoma, colonic carcinoma, lymphoma and prostatitis.PSA level is generally higher in low-grade tumours than inhigh-grade tumours.\\nTreatment of prostatic carcinoma consists of surgery,\\nradiotherapy and hormonal therapy. The hormonal depen-dence of prostate cancer consists of depriving the tumourcells of growth-promoting influence of testosterone. This canbe achieved by bilateral orchiectomy followed byadministration of oestrogen. Surgical approaches for prostatecancer include transurethral resection (TUR), radicalprostatectomy and transurethral US-guided laser-inducedprostatectomy (TULIP).\\n❑721CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital Tract\\nThe Female Genital Tract Chapter 24Chapter 24\\nVULVA\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe vulva consists of structures of ectodermal origin—labia\\nmajora, labia minora, mons pubis, clitoris, vestibule, hymen,Bartholin’s glands and minor vestibular glands. The monspubis and labia majora are covered externally by skin withhair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands includingapocrine glands. The inner surface of labia majora, labiaminora and vestibule are covered by stratified squamousepithelium. The clitoris is made up of vascular erectile tissue.Bartholin’s or vulvovaginal glands are located one on eachside of the mass of tissue forming labia majora. The glandsare racemose type and their secretions are released duringsexual excitement.\\nSince vulva is of ectodermal origin, the common inflam-\\nmatory conditions affecting it are similar to those found onthe skin generally. A few specific conditions such asBartholin’s cyst and abscess, vulvar dystrophy and certaintumours are described below.\\nBARTHOLIN’S CYST AND ABSCESS\\nInflammation of Bartholin’s vulvovaginal glands (Bartholin’s\\nadenitis) may occur due to bacterial infection, notablygonorrhoeal infection. Infection may be acute  or chronic.\\nAcute Bartholin’s adenitis  occurs from obstruction and\\ndilatation of the duct by infection resulting in formation of aBartholin’s abscess. The condition presents with intense pain,swelling and fluctuant mass which can be incised anddrained.\\nMicroscopic examination shows the usual appearance of\\nacute suppurative inflammation with neutrophilic infil-tration, hyperaemia, oedema and epithelial degeneration.\\nChronic Bartholin’s adenitis  results from a less virulent\\ninfection so that the process is slow and prolonged. Alter-natively, the chronic process evolves from repeated attacksof less severe acute inflammation which may be short ofabscess formation and resolves incompletely. In either case,the chronic inflammatory process terminates into fluid-filledBartholin’s cyst. The resulting cyst may be quite large,3-5 cm in diameter and readily palpable in the perineum,but may remain asymptomatic for years.\\nHistologic examination shows variable lining of the cyst\\nvarying from the transitional epithelium of the normalduct to a flattened lining because of increased intracysticpressure. The cyst wall may show chronic inflammatoryinfiltrate and a few mucus-secreting acini.\\nNON-NEOPLASTIC EPITHELIAL DISORDERS\\nThe older nomenclature vulvar dystrophy has been replaced\\nby more descriptive and clinically relevant term, non-neoplastic epithelial disorders of vulval skin and mucosa ofvulva. The term is applied to chronic lesions of the vulvacharacterised clinically by white, plaque-like, pruriticmucosal thickenings and pathologically by disorders ofepithelial growth. Clinicians often use the term ‘leukoplakia’\\nfor such white lesions. But white lesions may represent otherdepigmented conditions as well such as vitiligo, inflam-matory dermatoses, carcinoma in situ, Paget’s disease, or\\neven invasive carcinoma, and thus use of the termleukoplakia by pathologists is not recommneded.\\nCurrently, non-neoplastic epithelial disorders of the skin\\nof vulva includes following 2 lesions:\\n1.Lichen sclerosus (older term: atrophic dystrophy).\\n2.\\nSquamous hyperplasia (older term: hyperplastic\\ndystrophy).\\nThe two types of lesions may coexist in the same patient.\\nLichen Sclerosus\\nLichen sclerosus may occur anywhere in the skin (Chapter\\n26) but is more common and more extensive in the vulva inpost-menopausal women. The lesions appear as multiple,small, coalescent, yellowish-blue macules or papules whichproduce thin and shiny parchment-like skin. The lesions mayextend from vulva onto the perianal and perineal area.Clinically, the patient, usually a post-menopausal woman,complains of intense pruritus which may produce excoriationof the affected skin. Eventually, there is progressive shrinkageand atrophy resulting in narrowing of the introitus, clinicallyreferred to as kraurosis vulvae.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Microscopically,  the\\nfollowing characteristics are seen (Fig. 24.1,A) :\\n1.Hyperkeratosis of the surface layer.\\n2.Thinning of the epidermis with disappearance of rete\\nridges.3\\n. Amorphous homogeneous degenerative change in the\\ndermal collagen.4. Chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the mid-dermis.\\nLichen sclerosus is not a premalignant lesion and responds\\nfavourably to topical treatment with androgens.722SECTION III Systemic PathologySquamous Hyperplasia\\nSquamous hyperplasia is characterised by white, thickened\\nvulvar lesions which are usually itchy. The cause is unknownbut symptomatic relief results from use of topical treatmentwith corticosteroids.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. The histologic charac-\\nteristics are as under (Fig. 24.1,B) :\\n1. Hyperkeratosis.\\n2. Hyperplasia of squamous epithelium with elongationof rete ridges.3.\\nIncreased mitotic activity of squamous layers but\\ncytologically no atypia.4. Chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the underlyingdermis.\\nA small proportion of cases of hyperplastic dystrophy\\n(1-4%) may show cytologic atypia and produce vulvar dys-plasia which may progress to vulvar carcinoma in situ and\\ninvasive carcinoma.\\nVULVAL TUMOURS\\nVulva is the site of a variety of benign and malignant neo-\\nplasms which are in common with skin neoplasms elsewherein the body. These include papillomas, fibromas, neuro-fibromas, angiomas, lipomas, sweat gland tumours,squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous carcinoma, malignantmelanoma and mesenchymal sarcomas. However, a fewtumours peculiar to the vulva such as stromal polyps,papillary hidradenoma, condyloma acuminatum, extra-mammary Paget’s disease, vulval carcinoma and intra-epithelial neoplasia are discussed below.\\nStromal Polyps\\nStromal (fibroepithelial) polyps or acrochordons may form\\nin the vulva or vagina. There may be single or multiplepolypoid masses.Histologically,  they are covered by an orderly stratified\\nsquamous epithelium. The stroma consists of loose fibrousand myxomatous connective tissue with some adiposetissue and blood vessels.\\nPapillary Hidradenoma (Hidradenoma Papilliferum)\\nThis is a benign tumour arising from apocrine sweat glands\\nof the vulva. Most commonly, it is located in the labia or inthe perianal region as a small sharply circumscribed nodule.\\nHistologically,  the tumour lies in the dermis under a\\nnormal epidermis. The tumour consists of papillarystructures composed of fibrovascular stalk and is coveredby double layer of epithelial cells—a layer of flattenedmyoepithelial cells and an overlying layer of columnarcells.\\nCondyloma Acuminatum\\nCondyloma acuminata or anogenital warts are benign\\npapillary lesions of squamous epithelium which can betransmitted venereally to male sex partner. They may besolitary but more frequently are multiple forming soft wartymasses. The common locations are the anus, perineum,vaginal wall, vulva and vagina. They are induced by humanpapilloma virus (HPV), particularly types 6 and 11.\\nHistologically,  they are identical to their counterparts on\\nmale external genitalia (Chapter 23). The features consistof a tree-like proliferation of stratified squamousepithelium, showing marked acanthosis, hyperkeratosis,parakeratosis, papillomatosis and perinuclearvacuolisation of epithelium called koilocytosis, indicative\\nof HPV infection. The papillary projections consist of fibro-vascular stoma.\\nCondylomas are benign lesions and regress sponta-\\nneously except in immunosuppressed individuals.\\nExtra-Mammary Paget’s Disease\\nPaget’s disease of the vulva is a rare condition which has\\nskin manifestations like those of Paget’s disease of the nipple(Chapter 25). The affected skin, most often on the labiamajora, appears as map-like, red, scaly, elevated andindurated area.\\nHistologically,  extra-mammary Paget’s disease is\\nidentified by the presence of large, pale, carcinoma cellslying singly or in small clusters within the epidermis andadnexal structures. These cells characteristically have halowhich stains positively with PAS, alcian blue andmucicarmine and are thus believed to be of apocrineepithelial origin.\\nUnlike Paget’s disease of the breast in which case there\\nis always an underlying ductal carcinoma, extra-mammaryPaget’s disease is confined to the epidermis in most casesand only a small proportion of cases have an underlyingadenocarcinoma. Prognosis is good if there is no invasionbut occasional cases progress into invasive carcinoma.Figure 24.1 Non-neoplastic epithelial disorders of vulval skin.\\n723CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital TractVulval Intraepithelial Neoplasia and\\nInvasive Carcinoma\\nVulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and invasive\\nsquamous cell carcinoma are morphologically similar tothose in the cervix and vagina. The etiologic role of certainviruses in carcinogenesis, particularly high-risk HPV types16 and 18, in these sites is well documented. Mention hasalready been made about the preceding stage of vulvalepithelial disorders, particularly squamous hyperplasia, inthe development of these lesions. Vulval carcinomaconstitutes 3% of all female genital tract cancers. The usualage for development of cancer or VIN is the 4th to 6th decade.\\nGrossly,  VIN and vulval carcinoma in early stage is a\\n‘white’ lesion (leukoplakia) while later the area developsan exophytic or endophytic (ulcerative) growth pattern.The traditional VIN lesion, described as Bowen’s diseaseof the vulva, is generally a slightly elevated velvety plaquelesion.Microscopically,  these lesions are squamous cell type with\\nvarying anaplasia and depth of invasion depending uponthe stage (Fig. 24.2) . HPV-positive tumours are more often\\npoorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma whileHPV-negative are well-differentiated keratinising type.Verrucous carcinoma  is a rare variant which is a fungating\\ntumour but is locally malignant.\\nClinical staging  for vulval carcinoma based on tumour size\\n(< or > 2 cm) and extent of spread has been described byInternational Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics(FIGO staging,  Table 24.1 ).\\nVAGINA\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe vagina consists of a collapsed cylinder extending\\nbetween vestibule externally and the cervix internally.\\nHistologically, the vaginal wall consists of 3 layers: an outer\\nfibrous, a middle  muscular and an inner  epithelial. The\\nmuscular coat has a double layer of smooth muscle. The\\nepithelial layer consists of stratified squamous epitheliumwhich undergoes cytologic changes under hormonal stimuli.Oestrogen increases its thickness such as during reproductiveyears, whereas the epithelium is thin in childhood, andatrophic after menopause when oestrogen stimulation isminimal.\\nPrimary diseases of the vagina are uncommon. The only\\nimportant clinicopathologic conditions which require to bedescribed here are vaginitis and certain tumours.\\nVAGINITIS AND VULVOVAGINITIS\\nSince vulva and vagina are anatomically close to each other,\\noften inflammation of one affects the other location. Certainother infections are quite common in the vulva and vaginaas follows:\\nBacterial e.g. streptococci, staphylococci, Escherichia coli,\\nHaemophilus vaginalis.\\nFungal e.g. Candida albicans.\\nProtozoal e.g. Trichomonas vaginalis.\\nViral e.g. Herpes simplex.The most common causes of vaginitis are Candida\\n(moniliasis) and Trichomonas  (trichomoniasis). The hyphae\\nof Candida  can be seen in the vaginal smears. Similarly, the\\nprotozoa, Trichomonas,  can be identified in smears (Chapter\\n11). These infections are particularly common in pregnantand diabetic women and may involve both vulva and vagina.However, the adult vaginal mucosa is relatively resistant togonococcal infection because of its histology.\\nTUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE CONDITIONS\\nVaginal cysts such as Gartner’s duct (Wolffian) cyst lined by\\nglandular epithelium and vaginal inclusion cyst arising frominclusion of vaginal epithelium are more common benignvaginal tumours and tumour-like conditions. Otheruncommon benign tumours are papillomas, fibromas,lipomas, angiomas and leiomyomas and resemble theircounterparts elsewhere in the body. Primary malignanciesFigure 24.2 Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) lesion (Bowen’s\\ndisease). There is hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, acanthosis, koilocytosis\\nand presence of atypical anaplastic cells throughout the entire thicknessof the epithelium.

Squamous cell carcinoma  of vagina constitutes less than\\n2% of all gynaecologic malignancies and is similar in\\nmorphology as elsewhere in the female genital tract. The roleof HPV types 16 and 18 in its etiology and the possibility ofan extension from cervical carcinoma to the vagina have beenemphasised.\\n2.\\nAdenocarcinoma of the vagina is much less than\\nsquamous cell carcinoma of the vagina. It may be endo-\\nmetrioid or mucinous type. The significance of associationof diethylstilbestrol administered during pregnancy to themother with development of adenocarcinoma of the vaginain the daughter has been discussed in Chapter 8.\\nClinical staging of carcinoma of vagina proposed by FIGO\\nis given in  Table 24.2.\\nEmbryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma(Sarcoma Botyroides)\\nThis is an unusual and rare malignant tumour occurring in\\ninfants and children under 5 years of age. The commonlocation is anterior vaginal wall. Similar tumours may occurin the urinary bladder (Chapter 22), head and neck region(Chapter 18) (orbit, nasopharynx, middle ear, oral cavity) andbiliary tract.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\ncharacterised by bulky and polypoid grape-like mass(botyroides  = grape) that fills and projects out of the vagina.\\nHistologically,  the features are as under:\\n1.Groups of round to fusiform tumour cells are\\ncharacteristically lying underneath the vaginal epithelium,called cambium layer  of tumour cells.\\n2.\\nThe central core of polypoid masses is composed of\\nloose and myxoid stroma with many inflammatory cells.The tumour invades extensively in the pelvis and\\nmetastasises to regional lymph nodes and distant sites suchas to lungs and liver. Radical surgery combined withchemotherapy offers some benefit.\\nCERVIX\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe cervix consists of an internal os  communicating with the\\nendometrial cavity above, and an external os  opening into\\nthe vagina below. Ectocervix  (exocervix) or portio vaginalis is\\nthe part of the cervix exposed to the vagina and is lined by\\nstratified squamous epithelium, whereas the endocervix iscontinuous with the endocervical canal and is lined by asingle layer of tall columnar mucus-secreting epithelium. Theendocervical mucosa is thrown into folds resulting information of clefts and tunnels, commonly referred to ascervical glands that secrete mucus. The junction of theectocervix and endocervix— junctional mucosa,  consists of\\ngradual transition between squamous and columnarepithelia (squamo-columnar junction) and is clinically andpathologically significant landmark. The cervical mucosaundergoes changes under the influence of hormones andduring pregnancy. The cervical mucus varies during the men-strual cycle, being viscus after menses, but under theinfluence of oestrogen becomes thin which on drying formsfern-like pattern on glass slide.\\nLesions of the cervix are rather common. Of great signifi-\\ncance are cervicitis, certain benign tumours, dysplasia,carcinoma in situ  and invasive carcinoma.\\nCERVICITIS\\nSome degree of cervical inflammation is present in virtually\\nall multiparous women and some nulliparous women. Thenormal intact ectocervical stratified epithelium is usuallymore resistant to infection whereas the endocervicalcolumnar epithelium bears the brunt of the initialinflammation.\\nCervicitis may be specific or nonspecific, acute or chronic.\\nSpecific cervicitis  may be caused by tuberculosis, syphilis,\\ngranuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum,chlamydia and chancroid. Nonspecific cervicitis  is more\\nfrequent and is generally divided into acute and chronicforms, the latter being quite common.\\nACUTE CERVICITIS.  Acute cervicitis is usually associated\\nwith puerperium or gonococcal infection. Other causes are\\nprimary chancre and infection with herpes simplex.\\nGrossly,  the cervix shows everted endocervical mucosa\\nwhich is red and oedematous.Histologically,  there is infiltration of the subepithelial and\\nperiglandular tissue with neutrophils, and there is oedemaand congestion. The mucosa may be ulcerated andhaemorrhagic.\\nCHRONIC CERVICITIS.  Chronic nonspecific cervicitis is\\nencountered quite frequently and is the common cause ofleukorrhoea.

Other infecting organisms include gonococci,Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans  and herpes simplex.\\nFactors predisposing to chronic cervicitis are sexualintercourse, trauma of childbirth, instrumentation and excessor deficiency of oestrogen.\\nGrossly,  there is eversion of ectocervix with hyperaemia,\\noedema and granular surface. Nabothian (retention) cystsmay be grossly visible from the surface as pearly greyvesicles.Histologically,  chronic cervicitis is characterised by\\nextensive subepithelial inflammatory infiltrate oflymphocytes, plasma cells, large mononuclear cells and afew neutrophils. There may be formation of lymphoidfollicles termed follicular cervicitis.  The surface epithelium\\nmay be normal, or may show squamous metaplasia. Thesquamous epithelium of the ectocervix in cases of uterineprolapse may develop surface keratinisation andhyperkeratosis, so called epidermidisation. Areas of\\nsquamous metaplasia and hyperkeratosis may bemistaken on cursory microscopic look for a well-differentiated squamous carcinoma.\\nTUMOURS\\nBoth benign and malignant tumours are common in the\\ncervix. In addition, cervix is the site of ‘shades of grey’ lesionsthat include cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (cervical\\nintraepithelial neoplasia, CIN), currently termed squamousintraepithelial lesions (SIL). Benign tumours of the cervixconsist most commonly of cervical polyps. Uncommonbenign cervical tumours are leiomyomas, papillomas andcondyloma acuminatum which resemble in morphology withsimilar tumours elsewhere in the genital tract. The mostcommon malignant tumour is squamous carcinoma of thecervix.\\nCervical Polyps\\nCervical polyps are localised benign proliferations of\\nendocervical mucosa though they may protrude through theexternal os. They are found in 2-5% of adult women andproduce irregular vaginal spotting.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  cervical polyp is\\na small (up to 5 cm in size), bright red, fragile growthwhich is frequently pedunculated but may be sessile.Microscopically,  most cervical polyps are endocervical\\npolyps and are covered with endocervical epitheliumwhich may show squamous metaplasia. Less frequently,the covering is by squamous epithelium of the portiovaginalis. The stroma of the polyp is composed of looseand oedematous fibrous tissue with variable degree ofinflammatory infiltrate and contains dilated mucus-secreting endocervical glands (Fig. 24.3) .\\nMicroglandular Hyperplasia\\nMicroglandular hyperplasia is a benign condition of the\\ncervix in which there is closely packed proliferation ofendocervical glands without intervening stroma. Thecondition is caused by progestrin stimulation such as duringpregnancy, postpartum period and in women taking oralcontraceptives. Morphologically, condition may be mistakenfor well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.\\nSquamous Intraepithelial Lesion (SIL)\\n(Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia, CIN)\\nTERMINOLOGY.  Presently, the terms dysplasia, CIN,\\ncarcinoma in situ, and SIL are used synonymously as follows:\\nDYSPLASIA. The term ‘dysplasia’ (meaning ‘bad moul-\\nding’) has been commonly used for atypical cytologic\\nchanges in the layers of squamous epithelium, the changesbeing progressive (Chapter 3). Depending upon the thicknessof squamous epithelium involved by atypical cells, dysplasiais conventionally graded as mild, moderate  and severe. Carci-\\nnoma in situ  is the full-thickness involvement by atypical\\ncells, or in other words carcinoma confined to layers abovethe basement membrane. At times, severe dysplasia may notbe clearly demarcated from carcinoma in situ.  It is well\\naccepted that invasive cervical cancer evolves throughprogressive stages of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ.\\nCIN. An alternative classification is to group various grades\\nof dysplasia and carcinoma in situ together into cervical\\nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) which is similarly gradedfrom grade I to III. According to this concept, the criteria areas under:\\nCIN-1  represents less than one-third involvement of the\\nthickness of epithelium (mild dysplasia).\\nCIN-2  is one-third to two-third involvement (moderate\\ndysplasia).\\nCIN-3  is full-thickness involvement or equivalent to\\ncarcinoma in situ (severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ ).Figure 24.3 Endocervical polyp. The surface is covered by\\nendocervical mucosa with squamous met aplasia. The stromal core is\\ncomposed of dense fibrous tissue which shows nonspecific inflammation.\\n726SECTION III Systemic PathologySIL. Currently, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the\\nUS has proposed the Bethesda System (TBS)  for reporting\\ncervical and vaginal cytopathology. According to the\\nBethesda system, based on cytomorphologic features andHPV types implicated in their etiology, the three grades ofCIN are readjusted into two grades of squamousintraepithelial lesions (SIL)— low-grade SIL (L-SIL) and high-grade SIL (H-SIL) as under:\\nL-SIL  corresponds to CIN-1 and is a flat condyloma,\\nhaving koilocytic atypia, usually related to HPV 6 and 11infection (i.e. includes mild dysplasia and HPV infection).\\nH-SIL  corresponds to CIN-2 and 3 and has abnormal\\npleomorphic atypical squamous cells. HPV 16 and 18 areimplicated in the etiology of H-SIL (i.e. includes moderate\\ndysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ ).\\nA comparison of these classifications is shown in\\nTable 24.3.\\nProgressive grades of dysplsia/CIN/SIL is a classical\\nexample of progression of malignancy through stepwise\\nepithelial changes and that it can be detected early by simple\\nPapanicolaou cytologic test (‘Pap smear’) (Chapter 11). The\\nuse of Pap smear followed by colposcopy and biopsyconfirms the diagnosis which has helped greatly in institutingearly effective therapy and thus has reduced the incidenceof cervical cancer in the West.\\nCIN or SIL can develop at any age though it is rare before\\npuberty. Low-grade reversible changes arise in youngwomen between 25 and 30 years old, whereas progressivehigher grades of epithelial changes develop a decade later.Hence, the desirability of periodic Pap smears on all womenafter they become sexually active.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The biology of CIN/SIL and its\\nrelationship to invasive carcinoma of the cervix is well\\nunderstood by epidemiologic, virologic, molecular,immunologic and ultrastructural studies (Fig. 24.4) :\\n1.Epidemiologic studies.  Based on epidemiology of large\\npopulation of women with cervical cancer, several risk factorshave been identified which include the following 4 mostimportant factors:\\ni) Women having  early age of sexual activity .\\nii\\n) Women having multiple sexual partners .\\niii) Women with persistent HPV infection with high-risk types\\nof oncogenic virus.\\niv)Potential role of high risk male sexual partner such as\\npromiscuous male having previous multiple sexual partners,\\nhaving history of penile condyloma, or male who hadprevious spouse with cervical cancer.\\nIn addition to the above factors, other epidemiologic\\nobservations reveal high incidence of cervical cancer in lowersocioeconomic strata, in multiparous women, promiscuouswomen, cigarette smoking women, users of oralcontraceptives, HIV infection and immunosuppression,while a low incidence is noted in virgins and nuns.\\n2. Virologic studies.  Human papilloma virus (HPV)\\ninfection is strongly implicated in the etiology of cervical\\ncancer. By recombinant DNA hybridisation techniques,\\nfollowing observations have been documented:\\nHigh-risk type  HPV, most commonly of types 16 and 18\\n(in 70% cases), and less often types 31, 33, 52 and 58, arepresent in 70-100% cases of cervical cancer.\\nLow-risk type  HPV types 6 and 11 are found most\\nfrequently in condylomas.\\nMixed high and low risk types  of HPV may be found in\\ndysplasias.\\nBesides HPV, a few other viruses may adversely affect\\nthe prognosis but do not have etiologic relationship are HIV,HTLV-1 and EBV infection.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 24.3: Classification of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (CIN/SIL).\\nBethesda System HPV Types Morphology CIN Dysplasia\\nL-SIL 6, 11 Koilocytic atypia, flat condyloma CIN-1 Mild\\nH-SIL 16, 18 Progressive cellular atypia, loss of maturation CIN-2, \\nCIN-3 Moderate, severe,\\ncarcinoma in situ\\n(L-SIL = Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions; H-SIL = High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; CIN= Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia)\\nFigure 24.4 Role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the patho-\\ngenesis of cervical neoplasia.\\n727CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital Tract\\n3. Molecular studies.  Immunohistochemical, cytogenetic\\nand molecular studies have shown that low-risk HPV types\\ndo not integrate in the host cell genome, while high-risk HPV\\ntypes are integrated into the nucleus of cervical epithelialcells. Upon integration, protein product of HPV-16 and 18,E7 and E6 proteins respectively, inactivate tumour suppres-\\nsor genes, p53 and RB-1 gene, thus permitting uncontrolled\\ncellular proliferation. It has been possible to document that\\nmorphologic abnormalities in cervical lesions have good\\ncorrelation with underlying cellular events by use of\\ntechniques such as proliferation cell nuclear antigen\\n(PCNA), p16, p53  and p63 expression, and nucleolar organizer\\nregion (AgNOR). However, all women who harbour HPVinfection with high-risk type do not develop invasive cancer\\nof the cervix. Women who have persistence of this infection\\nor those who have another cofactor such as cigarette smokingor immunodeficiency, are at greater risk to developprogression of lesions.\\n4. Immunologic studies.  Circulating tumour specific anti-\\ngens and antibodies are detected in patients of cervical cancer.\\nAntibodies to virus specific antigens are identified on tumour\\ncells and in sera of such patients.Figure 24.5 Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). A, Schematic representation of histologic\\nchanges (lower part of figure). The grades of CIN-1 or mild dysplasia (L-SIL), CIN-2 (moderate dysplasia) and CIN-3 (severe dys plasia and\\ncarcinoma in situ) (together grouped as H-SIL) show progressive increase in the number of abnormal cells parallel to the increasing severity of\\ngrades. B, Exfoliative cytologic studies in various grades of cellular changes (upper part of figure).\\n5. Ultrastructural studies.  The changes observed on ultra-\\nstructural studies of cells in CIN/SIL reveal increased mito-chondria and free ribosomes, and depletion of normallyaccumulated glycogen in the surface cells. The latter changeforms the basis of Schiller’s test  in which the suspected cervix\\nis painted with solution of iodine and potassium iodide. Thecancerous focus, if present, fails to stain because of lack ofglycogen in the surface cells.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  no specific\\npicture is associated with cellular atypia found indysplasias or carcinoma in situ except that the changes\\nbegin at the squamocolumnar junction or transitionalzone. The diagnosis can be suspected clinically on the basisof Schiller’s test done on bedside.Histologically,  distinction between various grades of CIN\\nis quite subjective, but, in general dysplastic cells aredistributed in the layers of squamous epithelium forvarying thickness, and accordingly graded as mild,moderate and severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ\\n(Fig. 24.5,A) .\\n728SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nIn mild dysplasia (CIN-1), the abnormal cells extend up\\nto one-third thickness from the basal to the surface layer;\\nIn moderate dysplasia (CIN-2)  up to two-thirds;\\nIn severe dysplasia (CIN-3),  these cells extend from 75-\\n90% thickness of epithelium; and\\nIn carcinoma in situ (included in  CIN-3),  the entire\\nthickness from the basement membrane to the surface\\nshows dysplastic cells.\\n The atypical cells migrate to the surface layers from\\nwhere they are shed off (exfoliated) into vaginal secre-tions in Pap smear. The individual dysplastic or abnor-mal cells in these grades of atypia show various cytologicchanges such as: crowding of cells, pleomorphism, highnucleocytoplasmic ratio, coarse and irregular nuclearchromatin, numerous mitoses and scattered dyskaryoticcells.\\n The diagnosis of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ or CIN/\\nSIL is best made by exfoliative cytologic studies discussed in\\nChapter 11. The degree of atypicality in the exfoliated surfaceepithelial cells can be objectively graded on the basis of 3principal features (Fig. 24.5,B) :\\n1. More severe nuclear dyskaryotic changes such as\\nincreased hyperchromasia and nuclear membrane folding.\\n2.Decreased cytoplasmic maturation i.e. less cytoplasm as\\nthe surface cells show less maturation.\\n3.\\nIn lower grades of dysplasia (CIN-1/L-SIL) predomi-\\nnantly superficial and intermediate cells are shed off whereas\\nin severe dysplasia and in carcinoma in situ  (CIN-3/H-SIL)\\nthe desquamated cells are mainly small, dark basal cells. Thelesions of SIL in cytology have histologic correlation withcolposcopy-directed cervical biopsy in 70-90% cases(Fig. 24.6) .\\nCERVICAL SCREENING AND THE BETHESDASYSTEM.  With introduction of effective Pap screening\\nprogramme in the Western countries, incidence of invasivecervical cancer has declined greatly. However, stillworldwide cervical cancer remains third most commoncancer in women, next to breast and lung cancer. Althoughaccurate statistics are not available from India, but it isperhaps the leading cause of death in women. In the Papscreening programme, patients having abnormal Pap smearare appropriately followed up and, therefore, it requiresunderstanding of the Bethesda system by the clinician asregards value and limitations of cytology reports preparedby the cytologist/cytotechnician.\\nCervical screening recommendations  include annual\\ncervical smear in all sexually active women having any riskfactors listed above. However, if three consecutive Papsmears are negative in ‘high-risk women’ or satisfactory in‘low risk women’, frequency of Pap screening is reduced.There is no upper age limit for cervical screening.\\nThe broad principles of the Bethesda system of cytologic\\nevaluation are as under:\\nPap smears are evaluated as regards adequacy of specimen\\ni.e. satisfactory for evaluation, satisfactory but limited, orunsatisfactory for evaluation giving reason.\\nGeneral diagnosis is given in the form of normal or\\nabnormal smear.\\nDescriptive diagnosis  is given in abnormal smears that\\nincludes: benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes,and abnormalities of epithelial cells.\\nCellular abnormalities include: ASCUS  (atypical\\nsquamous cells of undetermined significance),  L-SIL\\n(mentioning HPV infection and CIN-1 present or not), H-SIL\\n(stating CIN-2 or CIN-3) and squamous cell carcinoma .\\nInvasive Cervical Cancer\\nInvasive cervical cancer in about 80% of cases is epidermoid\\n(squamous cell) carcinoma. The incidence of invasivecarcinoma of the cervix has shown a declining trend indeveloped countries in the last half of the century due toincreased use of Pap smear technique for early detection anddiagnosis but the incidence remains high in developing\\nFigure 24.6 Squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL).

The risk factors and\\netiologic factors are the same as for CIN discussed above.The peak incidence of invasive cervical cancer is in 4th to6th decades of life.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  invasive cervical\\ncarcinoma may present 3 types of patterns: fungating,ulcerating and infiltrating. The fungating or exophyticpattern appearing as cauliflower-like growth infiltratingthe adjacent vaginal wall is the most common type(Fig. 24.7) . Characteristically, cervical carcinoma arises\\nfrom the squamocolumnar junction. The advanced stageof the disease is characterised by widespread destructionand infiltration into adjacent structures including theurinary bladder, rectum, vagina and regional lymphnodes. Distant metastases occur in the lungs, liver, bonemarrow and kidneys.Histologically,  the following patterns are seen:\\n1.Epidermoid (Squamous cell) carcinoma.  This type\\ncomprises vast majority of invasive cervical carcinomas(about 70%).\\nThe most common pattern (70%) is moderately-\\ndifferentiated non-keratinising large cell type and hasbetter prognosis (Fig. 24.8) .\\nNext in frequency (25%) is well-differentiated kerati-\\nnising epidermoid carcinoma.\\nSmall cell undifferentiated carcinoma (neuroendocrine\\nor oat cell carcinoma) is less common (5%) and has a poorprognosis.Figure 24.7 Invasive carcinoma of the cervix common gross appear-\\nance is of a fungating or exophytic, cauliflower-like tumour. Gross\\nphotograph on right shows replacement of the cervix by irregular grey-white friable growth (arrow) extending into cervical canal as well as dist ally\\ninto attached vaginal cuff.\\nFigure 24.8 Invasive cancer cervix. Common histologic type is epidermoid (squamous cell) carcinoma showing the pattern of a moderately-\\ndifferentiated non-keratinising large cell carcinoma.\\n730SECTION III Systemic Pathology2. Adenocarcinoma.  Adenocarcinomas comprise about\\n20-25% of cases. These may be well-differentiated mucus-\\nsecreting adenocarcinoma, or clear cell type containingglycogen but no mucin.\\n3. Others.  The remaining 5% cases are a variety of other\\npatterns such as adenosquamous carcinoma, verrucous\\ncarcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma.\\nCLINICAL STAGING. Classification of cervical cancer\\ndescribed by the Cancer Committee of the InternationalFederation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGOclassification) is widely adopted by the clinicians andpathologists and is given in Table 24.4.\\nMYOMETRIUM AND ENDOMETRIUM\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe myometrium  is the thick muscular wall of the uterus\\nwhich is covered internally by uterine mucosa called the\\nendometrium.  The endometrium extends above the level of\\nthe internal os where it joins the endocervical epithelium.The myometrium is capable of marked alterations in its size,capacity and contractility during pregnancy and labour. Theendometrium responds in a cyclic fashion to the ovarianhormones with resultant monthly menstruation and hasremarkable regenerative capacity.\\nThe lesions pertaining to the corpus uteri and the\\nendometrium are numerous and constitute vast majority ofgynaecologic conditions. However, some of the importantpathologic entities are discussed below, but first, the cyclicchanges in normal menstrual cycle are briefly reviewed.\\nNORMAL CYCLIC CHANGES\\nThe normal endometrial cycle begins with proliferative phase\\nlasting for about 14 days under the influence of oestrogen,followed by ovulation on or around 14th day, and consequentsecretory phase under the influence of progesterone. Thecycle ends with endometrial shedding and the next cyclebegins anew.\\nThe histologic changes in different phases of the\\nmenstrual cycle vary.\\nHistologically,  the endometrium has different appearance\\nin different phases of the menstrual cycle. Essentially, theendometrium consists of 3 structures: the endometriallining epithelium, endometrial glands and stroma.\\nEpithelial lining  undergoes increase in its thickness\\nfrom cuboidal to tall columnar appearance at ovulationand subsequently regresses.\\nEndometrial glands  with their lining provide most of\\nthe information on phase of the menstrual cycle. In theimmediate postmenstrual period, the glands are straightand tubular, having columnar lining with basal nuclei.This phase is under the predominant influence ofoestrogen and lasts for about 14 days and is calledproliferative phase . The evidence of ovulation is taken from\\nthe appearance of convolutions in the glands and sub-nuclear vacuolation in the cells indicative of secretions.The secretory changes remain prominent for the next 7days after ovulation for implantation of the ovum if it hasbeen fertilised. Otherwise, the secretory activity wanesduring the following 7 days with increased luminalsecretions and a frayed and ragged luminal border of thecells lining the glands. This phase is under thepredominant influence of progesterone and is calledsecretory phase . Eventually, the endometrium is sloughed\\naway at menstruation  followed by beginning of the fresh\\ncycle (Fig. 24.9) .\\nEndometrial stroma  in the pre-ovulatory phase or\\nproliferative phase is generally dense and compact,composed of oval to spindled cells. In the post-ovulatoryphase or secretory phase, the stroma is loose andoedematous, composed of large, pale and polyhedral cells.The true decidual reaction  of the stroma occurs if the\\npregnancy has taken place. However, decidual reactionmay be suggested in the absence of pregnancy due toextreme response to progesterone. Thus, it may beimpossible to distinguish an advanced progestationalendometrium from early pregnancy except for thepresence of trophoblastic tissue.\\nEFFECTS OF HORMONES\\nIn addition to the changes that take place during the normal\\nmenstrual cycle, the endometrium undergoes morphologicchanges when hormonal preparations are administered, orduring pregnancy and menopause.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 24.4: FIGO Clinical Staging of Carcinoma of the Cervix\\nUteri.\\nStage 0 Carcinoma in situ\\nStage I Carcinoma strictly confined to the cervix\\nI\\nA Preclinical carcinomas diagnosed only by microscopy\\nMaximum size 5 mm deep and 7 mm across\\nmeasured from the base of epithelium.\\nIA1 Stromal invasion of less than 3 mm in depth and\\n7 mm in horizontal axis (minimally invasive).\\nIA2 Stromal invasion of 3 to 5 mm depth  and horizontal\\n7 mm or less (microinvasive).\\nIB Clinical lesion confined to the cervix or preclinical\\nlesions greater than stage IA.\\nIB1 Clinical lesions no greater than 4 cm in size.\\nIB2 Clinical lesions greater than 4 cm in size.\\nStage II Carcinoma extends beyond the cervix but has not\\nextended to the pelvic wall.

The therapeutic addition of progesteroneproduces secretory pattern in an oestrogen-primedendometrium. Oestrogen-progesterone combinationhormonal therapy is employed for control of conception.The sequential type of oestrogen-progesterone oralcontraceptives act by producing prolonged oestrogeniceffect past the time of ovulation and implantation so thatthe secretion is delayed until about 25th day, followed byprogestational effect and shedding. Repeated cyclicadministration with combination therapy such as after long-term use of oral contraceptives produces inactive-looking,small and atrophic endometrial glands, and compactdecidua-like stroma.\\nPregnancy\\nThe implantation of a fertilised ovum results in interruption\\nof the endometrial cycle. The endometrial glands are enlargedwith abundant glandular secretions and the stromal cellsbecome more plump, polygonal with increased cytoplasmtermed decidual reaction.  About 25% cases of uterine or\\nextrauterine pregnancy show hyperactive secretory statecalled Arias-Stella reaction.  It is characterised by\\nhyperchromatic, atypical, tall cells lining the glands and theglandular epithelium may show multilayering and buddingwhich may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma.\\nMenopause\\nThe onset of menopause is heralded with hormonal\\ntransition and consequent varying morphologic changes inthe endometrium. Most commonly, the senile endometrium,as it is generally called, is thin and atrophic with inactiveglands and fibrous stroma. However, some of the glandsmay show cystic dilatation. Sometimes, retrogressivehyperplasia is seen which is characterised by Swiss-cheesepattern of glands resembling endometrial hyperplasia butcomposed of inactive retrogressive lining epithelium. Thereis intermingling of cystic and dilated glands with small andatrophic glands. Postmenopausal endometrium may showactual active hyperplasia under the stimulatory influenceof post-menopausal oestrogen originating from the ovaryor adrenal gland.\\nDYSFUNCTIONAL UTERINE BLEEDING (DUB)\\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) may be defined as\\nexcessive bleeding occurring during or between menstrualperiods without a causative uterine lesion such as tumour,polyp, infection, hyperplasia, trauma, blood dyscrasia orpregnancy. DUB occurs most commonly in association withanovulatory cycles which are most frequent at the twoextremes of menstrual life i.e. either when the ovarianfunction is just beginning (menarche) or when it is waningoff (menopause). Anovulation is the result of prolonged andexcessive oestrogenic stimulation without the developmentof progestational phase. The causes for anovulation  at diffe-\\nrent ages are as follows:\\n1. In pre-puberty:  precocious puberty of hypothalamic,\\npituitary or ovarian origin.2.\\nIn adolescence:  anovulatory cycles at the onset of\\nmenstruation.\\n3. In reproductive age:  complications of pregnancy, endo-\\nmetrial hyperplasia, carcinoma, polyps, leiomyomas and\\nadenomyosis.\\n4.  At premenopause:  anovulatory cycles, irregular shedding,\\nendometrial hyperplasia, carcinoma and polyps.Figure 24.9 Sequential physiologic patterns of endometrium.\\n732SECTION III Systemic Pathology5. At perimenopause:  endometrial hyperplasia, carcinoma,\\npolyps and senile atrophy.\\nIt has been observed that women who ovulate may also\\noccasionally have anovulatory cycles. In addition to\\nanovulatory cycles, DUB may occur in inadequate luteal phase\\nthat manifests clinically as infertility (ovulatory dysfunctional\\nbleeding).  In such cases, the premenstrual endometrial biopsy\\nshows histologic lag of more than 2 days.\\nENDOMETRITIS AND MYOMETRITIS\\nInflammatory involvement of the endometrium and\\nmyometrium are uncommon clinical problems; myometritis\\nis seen less frequently than endometritis and occurs in\\ncontinuation with endometrial infections. Endometritis andmyometritis may be acute or chronic.\\nAcute form  generally results from 3 types of causes—\\npuerperal (following full-term delivery, abortion andretained products of conception), intrauterine contraceptivedevice (IUCD), and extension of gonorrheal infection fromthe cervix and vagina.\\nChronic form  is more common and occurs by the same\\ncauses which result in acute phase. In addition, tuberculous\\nendometritis  is an example of specific chronic inflammation,\\nuncommon in the Western countries but not so uncommonin developing countries. Its incidence in India is reported tobe approximately in 5% of women.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  In acute endometritis and\\nmyometritis,  there is progressive infiltration of the endo-\\nmetrium, myometrium and parametrium by polymorphs\\nand marked oedema. Chronic nonspecific endometritis and\\nmyometritis  are characterised by infiltration of plasma cells\\nalongwith lymphocytes and macrophages. Tuberculous\\nendometritis  is almost always associated with tuberculous\\nsalpingitis and shows small non-caseating granulomas(Fig. 24.10) .ADENOMYOSIS\\nAdenomyosis is defined as abnormal distribution of histo-\\nlogically benign endometrial tissue within the myometriumalongwith myometrial hypertrophy. The term adenomyoma\\nis used for actually circumscribed mass made up ofendometrium and smooth muscle tissue. Adenomyosis isfound in 15-20% of all hysterectomies. Pathogenesis of thecondition remains unexplained. The possible underlyingcause of the invasiveness and increased proliferation of theendometrium into the myometrium appears to be either ametaplasia or oestrogenic stimulation due to endocrinedysfunction of the ovary. Clinically, the patients of adeno-myosis generally complain of menorrhagia, colickydysmenorrhoea and menstrual pain in the sacral orsacrococcygeal regions.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the uterus may\\nbe slightly or markedly enlarged. On cut section, there isdiffuse thickness of the uterine wall with presence ofcoarsely trabecular, ill-defined areas of haemorrhages.Microscopically,  the diagnosis is based on the finding of\\nnormal, benign endometrial islands composed of glandsas well as stroma deep within the muscular layer. Theminimum distance between the endometrial islandswithin the myometrium and the basal endometriumshould be one low-power microscopic field (2-3 mm) formaking the diagnosis (Fig. 24.11) . Associated muscle\\nhypertrophy is generally present.\\nENDOMETRIOSIS\\nEndometriosis refers to the presence of endometrial glands\\nand stroma in abnormal locations outside the uterus.Endometriosis and adenomyosis are closely interlinked, somuch so that some gynaecologists have termed adenomyosis\\nFigure 24.10 Tuberculous endometritis. The stroma has caseating\\nepithelioid cell granulomas having Langhans’ giant cells and peripheral\\nlayer of lymphocytes.Figure 24.11 Adenomyosis. The endometrial glands are present\\ndeep inside the myometrium (arrow).\\n733CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital Tractas endometriosis interna  and the other category termed as\\nendometriosis externa  for similar appearance at the extrauterine\\nsites. However, the two differ as regards age, fertility and\\nhistogenesis and thus endometriosis should be regarded asa distinct clinicopathologic entity.\\nThe chief locations where the abnormal endometrial\\ndevelopment may occur are as follows (in descending orderof frequency): ovaries, uterine ligaments, rectovaginalseptum, pelvic peritoneum, laparotomy scars, andinfrequently in the umbilicus, vagina, vulva, appendix andhernial sacs.\\nThe histogenesis  of endometriosis has been a debatable\\nmatter for years. Currently, however, the following 3 theoriesof its histogenesis are described:\\n1.Transplantation or regurgitation theory  is based on the\\nassumption that ectopic endometrial tissue is transplanted\\nfrom the uterus to an abnormal location by way of fallopiantubes due to regurgitation of menstrual blood.\\n2.Metaplastic theory  suggests that ectopic endometrium\\ndevelops in situ  from local tissues by metaplasia of the\\ncoelomic epithelium.3.Vascular or lymphatic dissemination  explains the develop-\\nment of endometrial tissue at extrapelvic sites by these routes.\\nEndometriosis is characteristically a disease of\\nreproductive years of life. Clinical signs and symptoms\\ninclude intrapelvic bleeding from implants, severedysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia and infertility.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the appearance\\nof endometriosis varies widely depending upon thelocation and extent of the disease. Typically, the foci ofendometriosis appear as blue or brownish-blackunderneath the surface of the sites mentioned. Often, thesefoci are surrounded by fibrous tissue resulting inadherence to adjacent structures. The ovary is the mostcommon site of endometriosis and shows numerous cystsvarying in diameter from 0.1 to 2.5 cm. Ovarianinvolvement is often bilateral. Larger cysts, 3-5 cm indiameter, filled with old dark brown blood form ‘chocolate\\ncysts’  of the ovary.\\nHistologically,  the diagnosis is simple and rests on ident-\\nification of foci of endometrial glands and stroma, old ornew haemorrhages, haemosiderin-laden macrophagesand surrounding zone of inflammation and fibrosis\\n(Fig. 24.12) .\\nENDOMETRIAL HYPERPLASIAS\\nEndometrial hyperplasia is a condition characterised by\\nproliferative patterns of glandular and stromal tissues andcommonly associated with prolonged, profuse and irregularuterine bleeding in a menopausal or postmenopausalwoman. It may be emphasised here that the syndrome ofDUB with which endometrial hyperplasia is commonlyassociated is a clinical entity, while hyperplasia is apathologic term. Hyperplasia results from prolongedoestrogenic stimulation unopposed with any progestationalactivity. Such conditions include Stein-Leventhal syndrome,functioning granulosa-theca cell tumours, adrenocorticalhyperfunction and prolonged administration of oestrogen.Endometrial hyperplasia is clinically significant due to thepresence of cytologic atypia which is closely linked to endo-metrial carcinoma.\\nThe following classification of endometrial hyperplasias\\nis widely employed by most gynaecologic pathologists:\\n1. Simple hyperplasia without atypia (Cystic glandular\\nhyperplasia).\\n2.\\nComplex hyperplasia without atypia (Complex non-\\natypical hyperplasia).\\n3. Complex hyperplasia with atypia (Complex atypical\\nhyperplasia).\\nSIMPLE HYPERPLASIA WITHOUT ATYPIA (CYSTICGLANDULAR HYPERPLASIA).  Commonly termed\\ncystic glandular hyperplasia (CGH), this form ofendometrial hyperplasia is characterised by the presenceof varying-sized glands, many of which are large andcystically dilated and are lined by atrophic epithelium.Mitoses are scanty and there is no atypia. The stromabetween the glands is sparsely cellular and oedematous\\n(Fig. 24.13,A) .\\nThere is minimal risk (1%) of adenocarcinoma developing\\nin cystic hyperplasia.\\nCOMPLEX HYPERPLASIA WITHOUT ATYPIA\\n(COMPLEX NON-ATYPICAL HYPERPLASIA).  This\\ntype of hyperplasia shows distinct proliferative pattern.The glands are increased in number, exhibit variation insize and are irregular in shape. The glands are lined bymultiple layers of tall columnar epithelial cells with largenuclei which have not lost basal polarity and there is nosignificant atypia. The glandular epithelium at places isthrown into papillary infolds or out-pouchings intoadjacent stroma i.e. there is crowding and complexity of\\nFigure 24.12 Endometriosis in abdominal scar following caesarean\\nsection in the past. Dense fibrocollagenic tissue contains endometrial\\nglands, stroma and evidence of preceding old haemorrhage.\\n734SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nglands without cytologic atypia. The stroma is generally\\ndense, cellular and compact (Fig. 24.13,B) .\\nThe malignant potential of complex hyperplasia in the\\nabsence of cytologic atypia is 3%.\\nCOMPLEX HYPERPLASIA WITH ATYPIA (COMP-LEX ATYPICAL HYPERPLASIA).  Some authors have\\nsuggested the terms such as endometrial intraepithelialneoplasia (EIN) or carcinoma in situ  for this form of\\nendometrial hyperplasia. Complex hyperplasia withatypia is distinguished from complex non-atypicalhyperplasia by the presence of ‘atypical cells’ in thehyperplastic epithelium. The extent of cytologic atypiamay be mild, moderate or severe. The cytologic featurespresent in these cells include loss of polarity, large size,irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei, prominentnucleoli, and altered nucleocytoplasmic ratio(Fig. 24.13,C) .\\nComplex atypical hyperplasia is a precancerous condition\\nand its malignant transformation is related to the degree ofcytologic atypia. About 20-25% cases of untreated atypicalhyperplasia progress to carcinoma.Figure 24.13 Three forms of endometrial hyperplasias.\\n735CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital TractTUMOURS OF ENDOMETRIUM AND MYOMETRIUM\\nTumours arising from endometrium and myometrium may\\nbe benign or malignant. They may originate from differenttissues as under:\\nEndometrial glands —endometrial polyps, endometrial\\ncarcinoma.\\nEndometrial stroma —stromal nodules, stromal sarcoma.\\nSmooth muscle of the myometrium —leiomyoma,\\nleiomyosarcoma.\\nMullerian mesoderm —mixed mesodermal or mullerian\\ntumours.\\nOut of these, endometrial polyps, endometrial carcinoma,\\nleiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas are relatively morecommon and are described below.\\nEndometrial Polyps\\n‘Uterine polyp’ is clinical term used for a polypoid growth\\nprojecting into the uterine lumen and may be composed ofbenign lesions (e.g. endometrial or mucous polyp,leiomyomatous polyp and placental polyp), or malignantpolypoid tumours (e.g. endometrial carcinoma, choriocar-cinoma and sarcoma). The most common variety, however,is the one having the structure like that of endometrium andis termed endometrial or mucus polyp.  They are more common\\nin the perimenopausal age group. Small endometrial polypsgenerally remain asymptomatic and are detectedincidentally. The larger ones may ulcerate, degenerate andresult in clinical bleeding.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  endometrial\\npolyps may be single or multiple, usually sessile and small(0.5 to 3 cm in diameter) but occasionally they are largeand pedunculated.Histologically,  they are essentially made up of mixture\\nof endometrial glands and stroma. The histologic patternof the endometrial tissue in the polyp may resemble eitherfunctioning endometrium or hyperplastic endometriumof cystic hyperplasia type, the latter being more common.Rarely, a large endometrial polyp may undergo malignantchange.\\nEndometrial Carcinoma\\nCarcinoma of the endometrium, commonly called uterine\\ncancer, is the most common pelvic malignancy in females inthe United States and Eastern Europe but is uncommon inAsia where cervical cancer continues to be the leading cancerin women. Whereas the decline in the incidence of cervicalcancer in the developed countries is due to aggressive cervicalscreening programme leading to early detection and cure ofin situ  stage, increased frequency of endometrial carcinoma\\nin these countries may be due to longevity of women’s lifeto develop this cancer of older females. It is primarily adisease of postmenopausal women, the peak incidence atonset being 6th to 7th decades of life and is uncommon belowthe age of 40 years. The most important presenting complaintis abnormal bleeding in postmenopausal woman or excessiveflow in the premenopausal years.ETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The exact etiology of endometrial\\ncancer remains unknown. However, a few factors associatedwith increased frequency of its development are chronicunopposed oestrogen excess, obesity, diabetes, hypertensionand nulliparous state. There is irrefutable evidence ofrelationship of endometrial carcinoma with prolonged oestrogenicstimulation.  These evidences are as under:\\n1. Endometrial carcinoma has association with endometrial\\nhyperplasia (discussed above) in which there is unopposedchronic hyperoestrogenism and frequent anovulatory cycles.\\n2.\\nIn postmenopausal years when endometrial carcinoma\\noccurs characteristically, there is excessive synthesis of\\noestrogen in the body from adrenal as well as from ovariansources.\\n3. Women having oestrogen-secreting tumours (e.g. granu-\\nlosa cell tumour) have increased risk of developingsynchronous endometrial cancer.\\n4. Patients receiving prolonged exogenous oestrogen\\ntherapy are at higher risk of developing this cancer.\\n5. Women of breast cancer receiving tamoxifen for prolonged\\nperiod have 2-fold increased risk of developing uterinecancer.\\n6. Prolonged administration of oestrogen to laboratory\\nanimals can produce endometrial hyperplasia andcarcinoma.\\n7. Women with gonadal agenesis rarely develop endo-\\nmetrial carcinoma.\\nPathogenetically, papillary serous variant of endometrial\\ncarcinoma is associated with mutation in p53 tumour\\nsuppressor gene while endometrioid carcinoma has mutationin PTEN  gene located on chromosome 10. The role of heredity\\nin pathogenesis of endometrial cancer is supported by higherincidence in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)syndrome (having simultaneous cancers of the colon andendometrioid adenocarcinoma) and in Cowden syndrome(having simultaneous cancers of the breast, thyroid, andendometrium).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  endometrial\\ncarcinoma may have 2 patterns—localised polypoid tumour,\\nor a diffuse tumour; the latter being more common\\n(Fig. 24.14) . The tumour protrudes into the endometrial\\ncavity as irregular, friable and grey-tan mass. Extensionof the growth into the myometrium may be identified bythe presence of soft, friable and granular tissue in cutsection. In advanced disease, the involvement may extendbeyond the physiologic limits—into the cervical canal, intothe peritoneum, besides lymphatic metastases andhaematogenous metastases to distant sites such as lungs,liver, bones and other organs.Histologically,  most endometrial carcinomas are\\nadenocarcinomas, commonly termed endometrioid\\nadenocarcinomas  due to their resemblance with normal\\nendometrium. Depending upon the pattern of glands andindividual cell changes, these may be well-differentiated,moderately-differentiated or poorly-differentiated.\\nWell-differentiated adenocarcinoma  is characterised by\\nincrease in the number of glands which are closely packed736SECTION III Systemic Pathologysometimes showing ‘back-to-back crowding’ due to\\nobliterated intervening stroma. The glandular epitheliumshows stratification, formation of tufting and papillae andatypical changes. Most growths are well-differentiated(Fig. 24.15) .\\nModerately-differentiated adenocarcinoma shows all the\\nabove features alongwith presence of some solid sheetsof malignant cells.\\nPoorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma  is characterised by\\npresence of solid sheets and ribbons of malignant epithe-lial cells which show marked cytologic atypia and frequentmitoses. Glandular pattern is hard to find.\\nCases can also be categorised as regards histologic\\ngrade as follows:G1: Well-differentiated (predominantly glandular).\\nG2: Moderately-differentiated (glandular and partly solid\\nareas).G3: Poorly-differentiated (predominantly solid).\\nPapillary serous carcinoma  of the endometrium resembling\\nits ovarian counterpart is distinct since it occurs in thebackground of atrophic endometrium and is moreaggressive. Uncommon histologic variants  of endometrial carci-\\nnoma are: adenocarcinoma with squamous metaplasia(adenoacanthoma), adenosquamous carcinoma (when bothcomponents are frankly malignant), clear cell carcinoma,mucinous adenocarcinoma and papillary serous carcinoma.\\nCarcinoma of the endometrium is categorised into four\\nstages as per FIGO classification given in  Table 24.5.Figure 24.14 Endometrial carcinoma. A, B, Diagrammatic\\nrepresentation of the common gross patterns—localised polypoid growth\\nand diffuse growth. C, The specimen of the uterus and cervix showsenlarged uterus and dilated uterine cavity containing irregular , grey-white,\\nfriable growth arising from endometrial mucosa and invading the\\nunderlying myometrium superficially.\\nFigure 24.15 Endometrial carcinoma. The most common histologic pattern is well-differentiated adenocarcinoma showing closely packed\\n(back-to-back) glands with cytologic atypia.\\n737CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital TractLeiomyoma\\nLeiomyomas or fibromyomas, commonly called fibroids  by\\nthe gynaecologists, are the most common uterine tumours\\nof smooth muscle origin, often admixed with variable amountof fibrous tissue component. About 20% of women abovethe age of 30 years harbour uterine myomas of varying size.Vast majority of them are benign and cause no symptoms.Malignant transformation occurs in less than 0.5% ofleiomyomas. Symptomatic cases may produce abnormaluterine bleeding, pain, symptoms due to compression ofsurrounding structures and infertility.\\nThe cause of leiomyomas is unknown but the possible\\nstimulus to their proliferation is oestrogen. This is evidencedby increase in their size in pregnancy (Fig. 24.16,C)  and high\\ndose oestrogen-therapy and their regression followingmenopause and castration. Other possible factors implicatedin its etiology are human growth hormone and sterility.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Leiomyomas are mostfrequently located in the uterus where they may occurwithin the myometrium (intramural or interstitial),  the\\nserosa (subserosal),  or just underneath the endometrium\\n(submucosal).  Subserosal and submucosal leiomyomas\\nmay develop pedicles and protrude as pedunculatedmyomas. Leiomyomas may involve the cervix or broadligament.Grossly,  irrespective of their location, leiomyomas are\\noften multiple, circumscribed, firm, nodular, grey-whitemasses of variable size. On cut section, they exhibitcharacteristic whorled pattern (Fig. 24.16, A,B) .\\nHistologically,  they are essentially composed of 2 tissue\\nelements—whorled bundles of smooth muscle cellsadmixed with variable amount of connective tissue. Thesmooth muscle cells are uniform in size and shape withabundant cytoplasm and central oval nuclei (Fig. 24.17) .\\nCellular leiomyoma  has preponderance of smooth\\nmuscle elements and may superficially resemble leiomyo-sarcoma but is distinguished from it by the absence ofmitoses (see below).\\nThe pathologic appearance may be altered by\\nsecondary changes in the leiomyomas; these include:hyaline degeneration, cystic degeneration, infarction,calcification, infection and suppuration, necrosis, fattychange, and rarely, sarcomatous change.\\nLeiomyosarcoma\\nLeiomyosarcoma is an uncommon malignant tumour as\\ncompared to its rather common benign counterpart. Theincidence of malignancy in pre-existing leiomyoma is less\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 24.5: FIGO Clinical Staging of Carcinoma of the\\nEndometrium.\\nStage IA Tumour limited to endometrium.\\nIB Invasion to less than one-half the myometrium.\\nIC\\nInvasion to more than one-half the myometrium.\\nStage IIA Endocervical glandular involvement only.\\nIIB Cervical stromal invasion.\\nStage IIIA Tumour invades serosa and/or adnexa and/or positive\\nperitoneal cytology.\\nIIIB Metastases to pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes.\\nStage IVA Tumour invasion of bladder and/or bowel mucosa.\\nIVB Distant metastases including intra-abdominal and/or\\ninguinal lymph nodes.\\nFigure 24.16 Leiomyomas.

The peak age incidenceis seen in 4th to 6th decades of life. The symptoms producedare nonspecific such as uterine enlargement and abnormaluterine bleeding.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour may\\nform a diffuse, bulky, soft and fleshy mass, or a polypoidmass projecting into lumen.Histologically,  though there are usually some areas\\nshowing whorled arrangement of spindle-shaped smoothmuscle cells having large and hyperchromatic nuclei, thehallmark of diagnosis and prognosis is the number ofmitoses per high power field (HPF). The essentialdiagnostic criteria are: more than 10 mitoses per 10 HPFwith or without cellular atypia, or 5-10 mitoses per 10 HPFwith cellular atypia. More the number of mitoses per 10HPF, worse is the prognosis.\\nLeiomyosarcoma is liable to recur after removal and\\neventually metastasises to distant sites such as lungs, liver,bone and brain.\\nFALLOPIAN TUBES\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe fallopian tube or oviducts are paired structures, each\\nextending from superior angle of the uterus laterally to theregion of the ovaries and running in the superior border ofthe broad ligaments forming mesosalpinx. Each tube is7-14 cm long and is divided into 4 parts— interstitial portion\\nin the uterine cornual wall; narrow isthmic portion;  wider\\nampullary region;  and funnel-like distal infundibulum.  The\\ninfundibulum is fringed by fimbriae, the longest of whichcalled fimbria ovarica is attached to the ovary.\\nHistologically,  the wall of tube has 4 coats— serous\\nforming the peritoneal covering, subserous consisting of\\nfibrovascular tissue, muscular composed of longitudinal andcircular smooth muscle layers, and tubal mucosa  having 3\\ntypes of cells namely: ciliated, columnar and dark intercalatedcells. The tubal serosal covering may contain tiny nodularmasses of mesothelial cells forming Walthard’s cell rests.\\nThe major conditions involving the fallopian tubes are\\ninflammations, ectopic tubal gestation, and endometriosis.\\nINFLAMMATIONS\\nSalpingitis and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease\\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) by definition is a clinical\\nsyndrome characterised by signs and symptoms of ascendinginfection beginning in the vulva or vagina and spreadingthrough the entire genital tract. Although ascending routeof infection is the most common mode of spread, PID mayoccur following abortion and puerperium, with use ofintrauterine contraceptive devices, or from local intra-abdominal infections such as appendicitis with peritonitis.In addition, haematogenous spread may occur, though thisroute is more important in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.\\nMost commonly, PID occurs as a venereally-transmitted\\ninfection, chiefly caused by Chlamydia trachomatis  and\\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae. Post-abortal and postpartum infections\\nare mainly caused by staphylococci, streptococci, coliformbacteria, clostridia and pneumococci.\\nPatients generally complain of lower abdominal and\\npelvic pain which is often bilateral, dysmenorrhoea,menstrual abnormalities and fever with tachycardia. Long-standing chronic PID may lead to infertility and adhesionsbetween small intestine and pelvic organs.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the fallopian\\ntubes are invariably involved bilaterally. The distal endis blocked by inflammatory exudate and the lumina aredilated. There may be formation of loculated tubo-ovarianabscess involving the tube, ovary, broad ligament andadjacent part of uterus.Figure 24.17 Leiomyoma uterus. Microscopy shows whorls of smooth muscle cells which are spindle-shaped, having abundant cytoplasm and\\noval nuclei.\\n739CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital TractMicroscopically,  the appearance varies with the duration\\nof inflammatory process.\\nThe process begins with acute salpingitis characterised\\nby oedema and intense acute inflammatory infiltrate of\\nneutrophils involving the tubal mucosa as well as wall.The lumen is filled with purulent exudate consisting ofleucocytes and sloughed off epithelial cells.\\nThe purulent process may extend to involve tube as\\nwell as ovary causing salpingo-oophoritis and formingtubo-ovarian abscess.\\nThe escape of purulent exudate into the peritoneal\\ncavity produces pelvic peritonitis and pelvic abscess.\\nPyosalpinx  is distension of the fallopian tube with pus\\ndue to occluded fimbrial end.\\nEnd-result of pyosalpinx after resorption of the puru-\\nlent exudate is hydrosalpinx  in which the tube is thin-\\nwalled, dilated and filled with clear watery fluid.\\nAcute salpingitis may resolve with treatment but some\\ncases pass into chronic salpingitis  with infiltrate of\\npolymorphs, lymphocytes and plasma cells and fibrosis.\\nSalpingitis isthmica nodosa  used to be considered\\nanother manifestation of chronic salpingitis but currentlyaccepted pathogenesis of this lesion appears to be similarto that of adenomyosis. Nevertheless, the appearance ischaracterised by multiple nodules containing spaceswhich are lined by benign tubal epithelium. Inflammatorychanges are scanty or absent.\\nTuberculous Salpingitis\\nTuberculous salpingitis is almost always secondary to focus\\nelsewhere in the body. The tubercle bacilli reach the tube,most commonly by haematogenous route, generally from thelungs, but occasionally from the urinary tract or abdominalcavity. Tubal tuberculosis is always present when there istuberculosis of other female genital organs such as ofendometrium, cervix and lower genital tract. Thoughinfrequent in developed countries of the world, the incidenceof tubal tuberculosis in developing countries like India isestimated to be about 5%; concomitant involvement ofendometrium is present in about 80% cases. It affects morecommonly young women in their active reproductive life andthe most common complaint is infertility.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tube is dila-\\nted and contains purulent exudate though the fimbrial endis generally patent. The tubal peritoneum as well as theperitoneum in general is studded with yellowish tubercles.Microscopically,  typical caseating granulomas and\\nchronic inflammation are identified in the tubal serosa,muscularis and mucosa.\\nECTOPIC TUBAL PREGNANCY\\nThe term ectopic tubal pregnancy is used for implantation\\nof a fertilised ovum in the tube. Though ectopic pregnancymay rarely occur in the uterine horn, cornu, ovary andabdominal cavity, tubal pregnancy is by far the most commonform of ectopic gestation (Fig. 24.18) . Several factors whichpredispose to ectopic tubal pregnancy are: PID, previoustubal surgery, use of IUCD and congenital anomalies of thefemale genital tract. The most frequent site of tubal pregnancyis the ampullary portion and the least common is interstitialpregnancy. Ectopic tubal pregnancy is a potentiallyhazardous problem because of rupture which is followed byintraperitoneal haemorrhage.\\nTUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nTumours in the fallopian tubes are rare. Relatively more\\ncommon are hydatids of Morgagni or parovarian cysts whichare unilocular, thin-walled cysts hanging from the tubalfimbriae. Rare tumours include adenomatoid tumours,leiomyomas, teratomas, adenocarcinomas and choriocarci-noma all of which are similar in morphology to such tumourselsewhere in the body.\\nOVARIES\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe ovaries are paired bean-shaped organs hanging from\\neither tube by a mesentery called the mesovarium, the lateralsuspensory ligament and the ovarian ligament. The lateralsuspensory ligament of the ovary contains blood vessels,lymphatics and plexuses of nerves. Each ovary measures 2.5-5 cm in length, 1.5-3 cm in breadth and 0.7-1.5 cm in widthand weighs 4-8 gm.\\nHistologically,  the ovarian structure consists of covering\\nby coelomic epithelium, outer cortex and inner medulla(Fig. 24.19) .\\nCoelomic epithelium.  The surface of the ovary is covered\\nby a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells.\\nCortex.  During active reproductive life, the cortex is broad\\nand constitutes the predominant component of the ovary.\\nThe cortex contains numerous ovarian follicles and theirderivative structures. Each follicle consists of a central germ\\ncell ovum  surrounded by specialised gonadal stroma. This\\nstroma consists of granulosa cells encircling the ovum, and\\nconcentrically-arranged plump spindle-shaped theca cells.  In\\ninfancy, the granulosa cells form a single layer of cuboidal\\nFigure 24.18 Ectopic tubal gestation. The lumen of the fallopian\\ntube is dilated in the middle and contains dark tan, haemorrhagic and\\nfriable gestational tissue (sac, foetus and placenta).740SECTION III Systemic PathologyHistologically,  they are lined by granulosa cells.\\nOccasionally, however, there may be difficulty in\\ndistinguishing between a large cyst of coelomic epithelialorigin (serous  cyst) lined by flattened epithelial cells and a\\ncyst of follicular origin. Such cases are appropriatelydesignated as ‘simple cysts’.\\nLuteal cysts  are formed by rupture and sealing of corpus\\nhaemorrhagicum. The wall of these cysts is composed ofyellowish luteal tissue (lutein =  yellow pigment).\\nHistologically,  luteal cysts are commonly lined by\\nluteinised granulosa cells. Lining by predominantly lutei-nised theca cells may also be seen in cystic ovaries inassociation with hydatidiform mole and choriocarcinoma,and rarely, in normal pregnancy. Corpus albicans cyst is a\\nvariant of corpus luteum cyst in which there ishyalinisation in the wall and distension of the cavity withfluid.\\nPolycystic Ovary Disease (Stein-Leventhal Syndrome)\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a syndrome\\ncharacterised by oligomenorrhoea, anovulation, infertility,hirsutism and obesity in young women having bilaterallyenlarged and cystic ovaries. The principal biochemicalabnormalities in most patients are excessive production ofandrogens, and low levels of pituitary follicle stimulatinghormone (FSH). These endocrinologic abnormalities werepreviously attributed to primary ovarian dysfunction asevidenced by excellent results from wedge resection of theovary. Current concept of pathogenesis of PCOS is theunbalanced release of FSH and LH by the pituitary. FSH isinhibited to low levels by testosterone but the level of LH issufficient to cause luteinisation of ovarian theca andgranulosa cells which then secrete androgen inappropriatelyand produce an abnormal state of anovulation. A hereditarybasis for the syndrome has been suggested in some cases.\\nPATHOLOGIC CHANGES. Grossly,  the ovaries are\\nusually involved bilaterally and are at least twice the sizeof the normal ovary. They are grey-white in colour andFigure 24.19 Structure of the ovary to illustrate origin of ovarian tumours.\\ncells around the ovum but later form several layers. Granu-losa cells may form Call-Exner bodies  normally as well as in\\ncertain neoplastic conditions. Call-Exner bodies have acentral small round mass of dense pink material surroundedby a rosette of granulosa cells. The granulosa component isavascular and draws its nutrition from the highly vasculartheca component. The theca component has 2 parts—luteinised theca layer called theca interna,  and outer\\ncondensed ovarian stroma called theca externa.  Granulosa\\ncells and follicle-associated (luteinised) theca cells produceoestrogen. Fully mature ovarian follicle called graafian follicle\\nbursts releasing the ovum and becomes transformed intocorpus luteum which is the principal source of progesteronethat brings about secretory endometrial pattern. The corpusluteum is later replaced by corpus albicans. In addition tospecialised gonadal stroma and follicles, the cortex containsunspecialised ovarian stroma consisting of spindle-shapedconnective tissue cells and smooth muscle fibres.\\nMedulla.  The ovarian medulla is primarily made up of\\nconnective tissue fibres, smooth muscle cells and numerous\\nblood vessels, lymphatics and nerves. In addition, themedulla may also contain clusters of hilus cell (or hilar-Leydig cells) which may have androgenic role in contrast tooestrogenic role of the ovarian cortex.\\nThe major pathologic lesions of the ovary are the non-\\nneoplastic cysts and ovarian tumours.\\nNON-NEOPLASTIC CYSTS\\nThe most common of the non-neoplastic cysts of the ovary\\nare tubo-ovarian inflammatory mass (discussed above) andfollicular and luteal cysts. Polycystic ovarian disease of Stein-Leventhal syndrome is another cause of cystic ovary.\\nFollicular and Luteal Cysts\\nNormally follicles and corpus luteum do not exceed a\\ndiameter of 2 cm. When their diameter is greater than 3 cm,they are termed as cysts.\\nFollicular cysts  are frequently multiple, filled with clear\\nserous fluid and may attain a diameter upto 8 cm. Whenlarge, they produce clinical symptoms.\\n741CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital Tractovarian tumours. However, a few risk factors have been\\nidentified as under:\\n1. Nulliparity.  There is higher incidence of ovarian cancer in\\nunmarried women and married women with low or no\\nparity.\\n2. Heredity.  About 10% cases of ovarian cancer occur in\\nwomen with family history of ovarian or breast cancer.\\nWomen with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer susceptibilityhave mutation in tumour suppressor BRCA  gene— BRCA-1\\n(located on chromosome 17q) and BRCA-2 (located on\\nchromosome 13q). The risk in BRCA-1 carriers is higher\\ncompared to that in BRCA-2  carriers. Interestingly, men in\\nsuch families have an increased risk of prostate cancer. Inaddition to BRCA mutation, other molecular abnormalities\\nin ovarian cancers include mutation of p53 tumour\\nsuppressor gene and overexpression of ERBB-2  and K-RAS\\ngenes.\\n3. Complex genetic syndromes. Besides the above two main\\nfactors, several complex genetic syndromes are associated\\nwith ovarian tumours as follows:i) Lynch syndrome  associated with increased risk of ovarian\\ncancer.ii) Peutz-Jeghers syndrome  with ovarian sex cord-stromal\\ntumours.iii) Gonadal dysgenesis  with gonadoblastoma.\\niv) Nevoid basal cell carcinoma  with ovarian fibromas.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES AND CLASSIFICATION\\nIn general, benign ovarian tumours are more common,\\nparticularly in young women between the age of 20 and 40\\nyears, and account for 80% of all ovarian neoplasms.\\nMalignant tumours may be primary or metastatic, ovarybeing a common site for receiving metastases from variousother cancers. Primary malignant ovarian tumours are more\\ncommon in older women between the age of 40 and 60 years.\\nAlthough certain specific tumours have distinctive\\nfeatures such as elaboration of hormones, most benign and\\nmalignant ovarian tumours are discovered when they grow\\nsufficiently to cause abdominal discomfort and distension.\\nUrinary tract and gastrointestinal tract symptoms arefrequently associated due to compression by the tumour.Ascites is common in both benign and malignant ovarian\\ntumours. Menstrual irregularities may or may not be present.\\nSome ovarian tumours are bilateral. Malignant tumoursusually spread beyond the ovary to other sites before thediagnosis is made.\\nA simplified classification proposed by the WHO with\\nminor modifications has been widely adopted (Table 24.6) .\\nAccording to this classification, ovarian tumours arise fromnormally-occurring cellular components of the ovary\\n(Fig. 24.19) .

Both benign and malignant tumours occurin the ovaries.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS\\nUnlike the two other female genital cancers (cervix and\\nendometrium), not much is known about the etiology of742SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nFigure 24.20 Diagrammatic representation of general histologic criteria to distinguish benign, borderline (atypical proliferating) and malig nant\\nsurface epithelial tumours of the ovary.I. TUMOURS OF SURFACE EPITHELIUM\\n(COMMON EPITHELIAL TUMOURS)\\nTumours derived from the surface (coelomic) epithelium\\ncalled common epithelial tumours form the largest group of\\novarian tumours. This group constitutes about 60-70% of all\\novarian neoplasms and 90% of malignant ovarian tumours.The common epithelial tumours are of 3 major types— serous,\\nmucinous  and endometrioid,  though mixtures of these epithelia\\nmay occur in the same tumour. These tumours frequentlyhave prominent cystic component which may have a singleor multiple loculations and hence the descriptive prefixcystadeno-  in these tumou rs. In addition, surface epithelial\\ntumours may differentiate along urothelium to form Brenner\\ntumour,  and along mesonephroid pattern forming clear cell\\n(mesonephroid) adenocarcinoma.\\nDepending upon the aggressiveness, the surface epithe-\\nlial tumours are divided into 3 groups: clearly benign, clearly\\nmalignant,  and borderline  (or atypical proliferating  or low-grade )\\nmalignant tumours.  In general, the criteria for diagnosis of\\nthese 3 grades of aggressiveness are as follows (Fig. 24.20) :\\nClearly benign tumours  are lined by a single layer of\\nwell-oriented columnar epithelium. Papillary projections, if\\npresent, are covered by the same type of epithelium withoutany invasion into fibrovascular stromal stalk.\\nClearly malignant tumours  have anaplastic epithelial\\ncomponent, multilayering, loss of basal polarity andunquestionable stromal invasion. The prognosis of these\\ntumours is very poor.\\nBorderline (atypical proliferating) tumours  or tumours\\nwith low malignant potential have some morphological\\nfeatures of malignancy, apparent detachment of cellularclusters from their site of origin and essential absence ofstromal invasion. Morphological features of malignancywhich may be present in varying combinations include: strati-fication (2-3 layers) of the epithelial cells but generallymaintained basal polarity of nuclei, moderate nuclearabnormalities, and some mitotic activity. This group has amuch better prognosis than frankly malignant tumours ofthe ovary.\\nBased on this categorisation of biologic behaviour, groups\\nof surface epithelial ovarian tumours are described below:\\nSerous Tumours\\nSerous tumours comprise the largest group constituting\\nabout 20% of all ovarian tumours and 40% of malignantovarian tumours. They are called serous tumours because ofthe presence of clear, watery, serous fluid in thesepredominantly cystic tumours. About 60% of serous tumoursare benign, 15% borderline and 25% malignant. Only 20% ofbenign tumours occur bilaterally, whereas 65% of bothborderline and malignant serous tumours have bilateralovarian involvement. Serous tumours occur most commonlyin 2nd to 5th decades of life, the malignant forms being morefrequent in later life.\\nHistogenesis of the serous tumours is by metaplasia from\\nthe surface (coelomic) epithelium or mesothelium whichdifferentiates along tubal-type of epithelium.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  benign,\\nborderline and malignant serous tumours are large (above5 cm in diameter) and spherical masses. Small masses aregenerally unilocular while the larger serous cysts aremultiloculated similar to the mucinous variety, but differfrom the latter in containing serous fluid rather than theviscid fluid of mucinous tumours. Malignant serous\\ntumours  may have solid areas in the cystic mass. Exophytic\\nas well as intracystic papillary projections may be presentin all grades of serous tumours but are more frequent inmalignant tumours termed papillary serous cystadeno-carcinomas (Fig. 24.21) .\\nHistologically,  the features are as follows:\\n1. Serous cystadenoma  is characteristically lined by\\nproperly-oriented low columnar epithelium which issometimes ciliated and resembles tubal epithelium.Microscopic papillae may be found.\\n743CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital TractFigure 24.21 Papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary. It\\nshows an enlarged ovary replaced with a large unilocular cyst with\\nintracystic papillae (arrow).\\n2. Borderline (atypical proliferating) serous tumour\\nusually has stratification (2-3 layers) of benign serous typeof epithelium. There is detachment of cell clusters fromtheir site of origin and moderate features of malignancybut there is absence of stromal invasion.\\n3. Serous cystadenocarcinoma  has multilayered\\nmalignant cells which show loss of polarity, presence of\\nsolid sheets of anaplastic epithelial cells and definiteevidence of stromal invasion. Papillae formations are morefrequent in malignant variety and may be associated withpsammoma bodies but mere presence of psammomabodies is not indicative of malignancy (Fig. 24.22) .\\nMucinous Tumours\\nMucinous tumours are somewhat less common than serous\\ntumours and constitute about 20% of all ovarian tumoursand 10% of all ovarian cancers. Over 80% are benign, 10-15% are borderline (atypical proliferating) and 5-10% aremalignant. These predominantly cystic tumours containmucin which was previously described as pseudomucin.Well-differentiated borderline mucinous tumours areassociated with mucinous ascites termed pseudomyxomaperitonei  (page 579). As compared with serous tumours,\\nmucinous tumours are more commonly unilateral. Benignmucinous tumours occur bilaterally in 5% of cases while\\nborderline and malignant are bilateral in 20%. As per current\\nconcept, the diagnosis of primary ovarian mucinous\\nadenocarcinoma is made after excluding metastatic tumoursto the ovary, while bilateral mucinous adenocarcinoma ofthe ovary is invariably metastatic deposits to the ovary.\\nMucinous tumours occur principally between 2nd and 5th\\ndecades of life. Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma usuallydevelops in women above the age of 40 years.\\nHistogenesis  of mucinous tumours, in line with that of\\nserous tumours, is by metaplasia from the coelomicepithelium that differentiates along endocervical type orintestinal type of m ucosa.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  mucinous\\ntumours are much larger than serous tumours. They are\\nsmooth-surfaced cysts with characteristic multiloculationscontaining thick and viscid gelatinous fluid (Fig. 24.23) .\\nBenign tumours generally have thin wall and septadividing the loculi are also thin and often translucent, but\\nFigure 24.22 Papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary. Microscopic features include stratification of low columnar epithelium lining\\nthe inner surface of the cyst and a few psammoma bodies. The stroma shows invasion by clusters of anaplastic tumour cells.\\n744SECTION III Systemic Pathologymalignant varieties usually have thickened areas. In\\nyounger patients, an element of teratoma may berecognised in the firm areas of the tumour.\\nHistologically,  the most distinctive feature is the charac-\\nteristic tall columnar nonciliated epithelium lining the\\nloculi (Fig. 24.24) . Other features are as under:\\n1.Mucinous cystadenoma  is lined by a single layer of\\nthese cells having basal nuclei and apical mucinous vacuo-les. There is very little tendency to papillary proliferationof the epithelium.2. Borderline (atypical proliferating) mucinous tumouris identified by the same histologic criteria as forborderline serous tumour i.e. stratification (usually 2-3 cellthick) of typical epithelium without stromal invasion.3.Mucinous  cystadenocarcinoma  likewise is charac-\\nterised by piling up of malignant epithelium, at placesforming solid sheets, papillary formation, adenomatouspattern and infiltration into stroma with or without poolsof mucin.\\nEndometrioid T\\numours\\nEndometrioid tumours comprise about 5% of all ovariantumours. Most of them are malignant accounting for about20% of all ovarian cancers. Benign and borderline forms arevery rare. They are called endometrioid carcinomas becauseof the close resemblance of histologic pattern to that of uterineendometrioid adenocarcinoma. About 40% of ovarianendometrioid carcinomas have bilateral involvement. About15-30% of cases have coexistent endometrial adeno-carcinoma.\\nHistogenesis  of these tumours in majority of cases is\\nbelieved to be from ovarian coelomic epithelium differen-Figure 24.23 Mucinous cystadenoma of the ovary. Cut surface\\nshows a very large multilocular cyst without papillae. The cyst wall shows\\npresence of loculi containing gelatinous mucoid material.\\nFigure 24.24 Mucinous cystadenoma of the ovary. The cyst wall and the septa are lined by a single layer of tall columnar mucin-secreting\\nepithelium with basally-placed nuclei and large apical mucinous vacuoles.\\n745CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital Tracttiating towards endometrial type of epithelium. In view of\\npresence of endometriosis in a few cases of endometrioid\\ntumours, some authors have suggested malignant trans-formation of endometriosis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  these tumours\\nare partly solid and partly cystic and may have foci ofhaemorrhages, especially in benign variety.Histologically,  the endometrioid adenocarcinoma is\\ndistinguished from serous and mucinous carcinomas by\\ntypical glandular pattern that closely resembles that of\\nuterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma. There may be fociof squamous metaplasia justifying the diagnosis ofadenoacanthoma. Papillary pattern and foci of serous and\\nmucinous carcinoma may also be found. Benign variety\\nclosely resembles endometriosis with cystic change. Thereare no clearly defined criteria for borderline endometrioidtumours.\\nClear Cell (Mesonephroid) Tumours\\nClear cell (mesonephroid) tumours are almost always\\nmalignant and comprise about 5% of all ovarian cancers; rarebenign variety is called clear cell adenofibroma.  They are termed\\nclear cell or mesonephroid carcinomas because of the close\\nhistologic resemblance to renal adenocarcinoma. They have\\nalso been called as mesonephroma or mesonephric carcinomabecause of the questionable relationship to the mesonephricstructures.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  these tumours\\nare large, usually unilateral, partly solid and partly cystic.\\nLess than 10% are bilate ral.\\nHistologically,  clear cell or mesonephroid carcinoma is\\ncharacterised by tubules, glands, papillae, cysts and solid\\nsheets of tumour cells resembling cells of renal adeno-carcinoma i.e. clear cells having abundant eosinophiliccytoplasm rich in glycogen.\\nBrenner Tumour\\nBrenner tumours are uncommon and comprise about 2% of\\nall ovarian tumours. They are characteristically solid ovariantumours. Less than 10% of Brenner tumours are bilateral.Most Brenner tumours are benign. Rarely, borderline form\\nis encountered called ‘proliferating Brenner tumour’ while\\nthe one with carcinomatous change is termed ‘malignantBrenner tumour’.\\nHistogenesis  of the tumour is from coelomic epithelium\\nby metaplastic transformation into transitional epithelium(urothelium).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  Brenner tumour\\nis typically solid, yellow-grey, firm mass of variable size.Occasionally, a few scattered tiny cysts may be present\\non cut section.\\nHistologically,  Brenner tumour consists of nests, masses\\nand columns of epithelial cells, scattered in fibrous stromaof the ovary. These epithelial cells resemble urothelial cells\\nwhich are ovoid in shape, having clear cytoplasm,\\nvesicular nuclei with characteristic nuclear groove called‘coffee-bean’ nuclei.\\nII.GERM CELL TUMOURS\\nOvarian germ cell tumours arising from germ cells whichproduce the female gametes (i.e. ova) account for about 15-20% of all ovarian n eoplasms. The neoplastic germ cells may\\nfollow one of the several lines of differentiation as shown in\\nFig. 24.25 . Nearly 95% of them are benign and occur chiefly\\nin young females, vast majority of them being benign cysticteratomas (dermoid cysts). The remainder are malignant\\nFigure 24.25 Histogenetic classification of germ cell tumours of the ovary.\\n746SECTION III Systemic Pathologygerm cell tumours comprising a variety of morphologic forms\\noccurring chiefly in children and young adults and are highlyaggressive tumours. Most germ cell tumours of the ovarieshave their counterparts in the testis (Chapter 23) andsometimes in the mediastinum but their frequency differsfrom one site to the other. For instance, benign cystic teratomaor dermoid cyst so common in ovaries is extremely rare inthe testis.\\nTeratomas\\nTeratomas are tumours composed of different types of tissues\\nderived from the three germ cell layers—ectoderm, meso-derm and endoderm, in different combinations. In view ofwide spectrum of tissue elements found in these teratomas,their histogenesis  has been a matter of speculation for a long\\ntime. Cytogenetic studies have revealed that these tumoursarise from a single germ cell (ovum) after its first meioticdivision.\\nTeratomas are divided into 3 types: mature (benign),\\nimmature (malignant), and monodermal or highlyspecialised teratomas.\\nMATURE (BENIGN) TERATOMA.  Vast majority of ovarian\\nteratomas are benign and cystic and have the predominant\\nectodermal elements, often termed clinically as dermoid cyst.\\nInfrequently, mature teratoma may be solid and benign andhas to be distinguished from immature or malignantteratoma. Benign cystic teratomas are more frequent in youngwomen during their active reproductive life. The tumour isbilateral in 10% of cases.\\nGrossly,  benign cystic teratoma or dermoid cyst is\\ncharacteristically a unilocular cyst, 10-15 cm in diameter,usually lined by the skin and hence its name. Onsectioning, the cyst is filled with paste-like sebaceoussecretions and desquamated keratin admixed with massesof hair. The cyst wall is thin and opaque grey-white. Gene-rally, in one area of the cyst wall, a solid prominence isseen (Rokitansky’s protuberance) where tissue elementssuch as tooth, bone, cartilage and various other odd tissuesare present (Fig. 24.26) . Less often, the cyst may contain\\nmucoid material.Microscopically,  the most prominent feature is the lining\\nof the cyst wall by stratified squamous epithelium and itsadnexal structures such as sebaceous glands, sweat glandsand hair follicles (Fig. 24.27) . Though ectodermal\\nderivatives are most prominent features, tissues ofmesodermal and endodermal origin are also commonlypresent. Various other tissue components frequentlyfound in teratomas are bronchus, intestinal epithelium,cartilage, bone, tooth, smooth muscle, neural tissue,salivary gland, retina, pancreas and thyroid tissue. Thus,viewing a benign cystic teratoma in different microscopicfields reveals a variety of mature differentiated tissueelements, producing kaleidoscopic patterns.\\nLess than 1% of patients with a dermoid cyst develop\\nmalignant transformation of one of the tissue components,most commonly squamous cell carcinoma.\\nIMMATURE (MALIGNANT) TERATOMA.  Immature or\\nmalignant teratomas of the ovary are rare and account forapproximately 0.2% of all ovarian tumours. They arepredominantly solid tumours that contain immature orembryonal structures in contrast to the mature or adultstructures of the benign teratomas. They are more commonin prepubertal adolescents and young women under 20 yearsof age.\\nGrossly,  malignant teratoma is a unilateral solid mass\\nwhich on cut section shows characteristic variegatedappearance revealing areas of haemorrhages, necrosis,tiny cysts and heterogeneous admixture of various tissueelements.\\nMicroscopically,  parts of the tumour may show mature\\ntissues, while most of it is composed of immature tissuesFigure 24.26 Dermoid cyst of the ovary. The ovary is enlarged and\\nshows a large unilocular cyst containing hair, pultaceous material and\\nbony tissue.\\n747CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital Tracthaving an embryonic appearance. Immature tissue\\nelements may differentiate towards cartilage, bone,glandular structures, neural tissue etc, and are distributedin spindle-shaped myxoid or undifferentiated sarcomacells. An important factor in grading and determining theprognosis of immature teratoma is the relative amount ofimmature neural tissue. Immature neural tissue canundergo maturation even at the site of metastases over aperiod of years. Immature teratoma may contain areas ofother germ cell tumours such as endodermal sinustumour, embryonal carcinoma and choriocarcinoma.\\nGrade I tumours having relatively mature elements and\\nconfined to the ovary have a good prognosis, whereas gradeIII immature teratomas with metastases have an extremelypoor prognosis.\\nMONODERMAL (SPECIALISED) TERATOMA.  Mono-\\ndermal or highly specialised teratomas are rare and include\\n2 important examples—struma ovarii and carcinoid tumour.\\nStruma ovarii.  It is a teratoma composed exclusively\\nof thyroid tissue, recognisable grossly as well as micros-copically. Most often, the tumour has the appearance of afollicular adenoma of the thyroid. Rarely, struma ovariimay be hyperfunctioning and produce hyperthyroidism.\\nCarcinoid tumour.  This is an ovarian teratoma arising\\nfrom argentaffin cells of intestinal epithelium in theteratoma. Ovarian carcinoid may also hyperfunction andproduce 5-HT and consequent carcinoid syndrome.\\nStruma-carcinoid is a rare combination of struma\\novarii and ovarian carcinoid.\\nDysgerminoma\\nDysgerminoma is an ovarian counterpart of seminoma of\\nthe testes (page 709). Dysgerminomas comprise about 2% ofall ovarian cancers. They occur most commonly in 2nd to3rd decades. About 10% of them are bilateral. About 10% ofpatients with dysgerminoma have elevated hCG level in theplasma. All dysgerminomas are malignant and are extremelyradiosensitive.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  dysgerminoma\\nis a solid mass of variable size. Cut section of the tumouris grey-white to pink, lobulated, soft and fleshy with fociof haemorrhages and necrosis.Histologically,  their structure is similar to that of\\nseminoma of the testis (Fig. 24.28) . The tumour cells are\\narranged in diffuse sheets, islands and cords separatedby scanty fibrous stroma. The tumour cells are uniformin appearance and large, with vesicular nuclei and clearcytoplasm rich in glycogen. The fibrous stroma generallycontains lymphocytic infiltrate and sometimes may havesarcoid granulomas.Figure 24.27 Benign cystic teratoma. Microscopy shows characteristic lining of the cyst wall by epidermis and its appendages. Islands of\\nmature cartilage are also seen.\\nFigure 24.28 Dysgerminoma. The histologic appearance is identical\\nto that of seminoma of the testis. Masses of large uniform tumour cells\\nare separated by scanty fibrous stroma that is infiltrated by lymphocytes.\\n748SECTION III Systemic PathologyEndodermal Sinus (Yolk Sac) Tumour\\nEndodermal sinus tumour or yolk sac tumour is the second\\nmost common germ cell tumour occurring most frequentlyin children and young women. More often, endodermalsinus tumour is found in combination with other germ celltumours rather than in pure form. The tumour is rich inalphafetoprotein (AFP) and α-1-antitrypsin. The tumour is\\nusually unilateral but may metastasise to the other ovary.It is a highly aggressive and rapidly growing tumour.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\ngenerally solid with areas of cystic degeneration.Histologically,  like its testicular counterpart, the endo-\\ndermal sinus tumour is characterised by the presence ofpapillary projections having a central blood vessel withperivascular layer of anaplastic embryonal germ cells.Such structures resemble the endodermal sinuses of therat placenta (Schiller-Duval body) from which the tumourderives its name. It is common to find intracellular andextracelluar PAS-positive hyaline globules which arecomposed of AFP (Fig. 24.29) .\\nChoriocarcinoma\\nChoriocarcinoma in females is of 2 types— gestational and non-\\ngestational.  Gestational choriocarcinoma of placental origin\\nis more common and considered separately later (page 752).\\nPure primary non-gestational choriocarcinoma of ovarianorigin is rare while its combination with other germ celltumours is seen more often. The patients are usually younggirls under the age of 20 years. Morphologically, ovarianchoriocarcinoma is identical to gestational choriocarcinoma.Ovarian choriocarcinoma is more malignant than that ofplacental origin and disseminates widely via bloodstreamto the lungs, liver, bone, brain and kidneys. The marker forboth types of choriocarcinoma is hCG.\\nOther Germ Cell Tumours\\nCertain other germ cell tumours occasionally encountered\\nin the ovaries are embryonal carcinoma, polyembryoma andmixed germ cell tumours. All these tumours aremorphologically identical to similar tumours occurring inthe testes (Chapter 24).\\nIII. SEX CORD-STROMAL TUMOURS\\nSex cord-stromal tumours of the ovaries comprise 5-10% of\\nall ovarian neoplasms. They arise from specialised ovarianstromal cells of the developing gonads. Thus, these includetumours originating from granulosa cells, theca cells andSertoli-Leydig cells. Since sex cord-stromal cells havefunctional activity, most of these tumours elaborate steroidhormones which may have feminising effects ormasculinising effects.\\nGranulosa-Theca Cell Tumours\\nGranulosa-theca cell tumours comprise about 5% of all\\novarian tumours. The group includes: pure granulosa celltumours, pure thecomas, combination of granulosa-theca celltumours and fibromas.\\nGRANULOSA CELL TUMOUR.  Pure granulosa cell\\ntumours may occur at all ages. These tumours invade locally\\nbut occasionally may have more aggressive and malignantbehaviour. Recurrences after surgical removal are common.Most granulosa cell tumours secrete oestrogen which maybe responsible for precocious puberty in young girls, or inolder patients may produce endometrial hyperplasia,endometrial adenocarcinoma and cystic disease of the breast.Rarely, granulosa cell tumour may elaborate androgen whichmay have masculinising effect on the patient.\\nGrossly,  granulosa cell tumour is a small, solid, partly\\ncystic and usually unilateral tumour. Cut section of solidareas is yellowish-brown (Fig. 24.30) .\\nFigure 24.30 Solid ovarian tumour. Specimen of the uterus, cervix\\nand adnexa shows enlarged ovarian mass (arrow) on one side which on\\ncut section is solid, grey-white and firm.Figure 24.29 Endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumour ovary. The tumour\\nhas microcystic pattern and has highly anaplastic tumour cells. Severalcharacteristic Schiller-Duval bodies are present. Inset shows intra- andextracellular hyaline globules.\\n749CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital Tract\\nFigure 24.31 Granulosa cell tumour showing uniform granulosa cells and numerous rosette-like Call-Exner bodies containing central amorphous\\npink material surrounded by granulosa cells.\\nMicroscopically,  the granulosa cells are arranged in a\\nvariety of patterns including micro- and macrofollicular,\\ntrabecular, bands and diffuse sheets. The microfollicularpattern is characterised by the presence of characteristicrosette-like structures, Call-Exner bodies, having centralrounded pink mass surrounded by a circular row ofgranulosa cells (Fig. 24.31) .\\nMorphologic appearance alone is a poor indicator of\\nclinical malignancy but presence of metastases and invasionoutside the ovary are considered better indicators ofaggressive behaviour.\\nTHECOMA.  Pure thecomas are almost always benign. They\\noccur more frequently in postmenopausal women.\\nThecomas are typically oestrogenic. Endometrialhyperplasia, endometrial carcinoma and cystic disease ofthe breast are some of its adverse effects. Occasionally athecoma may secrete androgen and cause virilisation.\\nGrossly,  thecoma is a solid and firm mass, 5-10 cm in\\ndiameter. Cut section is yellowish.Microscopically,  thecoma consists of spindle-shaped theca\\ncells of the ovary admixed with variable amount ofhyalinised collagen. The cytoplasm of theca cells is lipid-rich and vacuolated which reacts with lipid stains.\\nGRANULOSA-THECA CELL TUMOUR.  Mixture of both\\ngranulosa and theca cell elements in the same ovarian tumouris seen in some cases with elaboration of oestrogen.\\nFIBROMA.  Fibromas of the ovary are more common and\\naccount for about 5% of all ovarian tumours. These tumours\\nare hormonally inert but some of them are associated withpleural effusion and benign ascites termed Meig’s syndrome.\\nGrossly,  these tumours are large, firm and fibrous, usually\\nunilateral masses.Histologically,  they are composed of spindle-shaped well-\\ndifferentiated fibroblasts and collagen. Sometimes,combination of fibroma and thecoma is present calledfibrothecoma.\\nSertoli-Leydig Cell Tumours(Androblastoma, Arrhenoblastoma)\\nTumours containing Sertoli and Leydig cells in varying\\ndegree of maturation comprise Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours,also called androblastomas or arrhenoblastomas. Charac-teristically, they produce androgens and masculinise thepatient. Less often, they may elaborate oestrogen. Their peakincidence is in 2nd to 3rd decades of life.\\nGrossly,  Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour resembles a granulosa-\\ntheca cell tumour.Histologically,  these tumours recapitulate to some extent\\nthe structure of the testis. Three histologic types aredistinguished:1.Well-differentiated  androblastoma composed almost\\nentirely of Sertoli cells or Leydig cells forming well-definedtubules.2\\n. Tumours with intermediate differentiation have a biphasic\\npattern with formation of solid sheets in which abortivetubules are present.3. Poorly-differentiated or sarcomatoid variety  is composed\\nof spindle cells resembling sarcoma with interspersedscanty Leydig cells.\\nGynandroblastoma\\nGynandroblastoma is an extremely rare tumour in which\\nthere is combination of patterns of both granulosa-theca celltumour and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour. The termgynandroblastoma stands for combination of female (gyn)\\nand male (andro).\\nIV. MISCELLANEOUS TUMOURS\\nLIPID  CELL TUMOURS.  There is a small group of ovarian\\ntumours that appears as soft yellow or yellow-brown nodules\\nwhich on histologic examination are composed of large lipid-750SECTION III Systemic Pathologyladen cells. These cells resemble Leydig, lutein and adrenal\\ncortical cells. The examples of these tumours are: hilus celltumours, adrenal rest tumours and luteomas. These tumourselaborate steroid hormones and are responsible for variousendocrine dysfunctions such as Cushing’s syndrome andvirilisation.\\nGONADOBLASTOMA.  This is a rare tumour occurring\\nexclusively in dysgenetic gonads, more often in phenotypic\\nfemales and in hermaphrodites. Dysfunctions includevirilism, amenorrhoea and abnormal external genitalia.\\nMicroscopically,  gonadoblastoma is composed of mixture\\nof germ cell and sex cord components.\\nV. METASTATIC TUMOURS\\nAbout 10% of ovarian cancers are secondary carcinomas.\\nMetastasis may occur by lymphatic or haematogenous routebut direct extension from adjacent organs (e.g. uterus,fallopian tube and sigmoid colon) too occurs frequently.Bilaterality of the tumour is the most helpful clue to diagnosisof metastatic tumour. Most common primary sites fromwhere metastases to the ovaries are encountered are:carcinomas of the breast, genital tract, gastrointestinal tract(e.g. stomach, colon appendix, pancreas, biliary tract) andhaematopoietic malignancies.\\nKrukenberg Tumour\\nKrukenberg tumour  is a distinctive bilateral tumour meta-\\nstatic to the ovaries by transcoelomic spread. The tumour is\\ngenerally secondary to a gastric carcinoma (page 557) butother primary sites where mucinous carcinomas occur (e.g.colon, appendix and breast) may also produce Krukenbergtumour in the ovary. Rarely, a tumour having the pattern ofKrukenberg tumour is primary in the ovary.\\nGrossly,  Krukenberg tumour forms rounded or kidney-\\nshaped firm large masses in both ovaries. Cut sectionshows grey-white to yellow firm fleshy tumour and mayhave areas of haemorrhage and necrosis (Fig. 24.32) .\\nMicroscopically,  it is characterised by the presence of\\nmucus-filled signet ring cells which may lie singly or inclusters. It is accompanied by sarcoma-like cellular prolife-ration of ovarian stroma (Fig. 24.33) .\\nFIGO staging of ovarian cancer is given in Table 24.7.Figure 24.32 Krukenberg tumour showing characteristic bilateral metastatic ovarian cancer (arrow) having firm white appearance.\\nFigure 24.33 Krukenberg tumour. Histologic features include mucin-filled signet-ring cells and richly cellular proliferation of the ovarian stroma.\\n751CHAPTER 24 The Female Genital TractPLACENTA\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nAt term, the normal placenta is blue red, rounded, flattened\\nand discoid organ 15-20 cm in diameter and 2-4 cm thick. Itweighs 400-600 gm or about one-sixth the weight of thenewborn. The umbilical cord is about 50 cm long andcontains two umbilical arteries and one umbilical veinattached at the foetal surface. The placenta is derived fromboth maternal and foetal tissues. The maternal portion  of the\\nplacenta has irregular grooves dividing it into cotyledonswhich are composed of sheets of decidua basalis andremnants of blood vessels. The  foetal portion  of the placenta\\nis composed of numerous functional units called chorionicvilli and comprise the major part of placenta at term. Thevilli consist of a loose fibrovascular stromal core and a fewphagocytic (H öffbauer’s) cells. The villous core is covered\\nby an inner layer of cytotrophoblast and outer layer ofsyncytiotrophoblast. The basement membrane separatingthe foetal capillaries in the villous core and the trophoblastforms zones where nutrients and metabolites aretransported between the mother and the foetus. Such zonesare called vasculosyncitial membranes. The placentasecretes a number of hormones and enzymes into thematernal blood. These include: human chorionic gonado\\n-\\ntropin (hCG), human placental lactogen (HPL), chorionicthyrotropin and adrenocorticotropin hormone whichpartake in oestrogen and progesterone metabolism.\\nDiseases related to pregnancy and placenta are numerous\\nand form the subject matter of discussion in obstetrics.Certain conditions such as inflammation of the placenta andchorionic membranes (placentitis and chorioamnionitis),placental abnormalities (e.g. placenta accreta, placentapraevia and twin placenta etc), toxaemia of pregnancy(eclampsia and pre-eclampsia) and products of gestation seenin abortions need mere mention only here. However,gestational trophoblastic diseases resulting from benignand malignant overgrowth of trophoblast—hydatidiformmole (complete and partial mole) and choriocarcinomarespectively, are significant morphologic lessions and arediscussed below and their features contrasted in Table 24.8.\\nHYDA TIDIFORM MOLE\\nThe word ‘hydatidiform’ means drop of water and ‘mole’ for\\na shapeless mass.  Hydatidiform mole is defined as an abnormal\\nplacenta characterised by 2 features:i) Enlarged, oedematous and hydropic change of thechorionic villi which become vesicular.ii) Variable amount of trophoblastic proliferation.\\nMost workers consider hydatidiform mole as a benign\\ntumour of placental tissue with potential for developing intochoriocarcinoma, while some authors have described moleas a degenerative lesion though capable of neoplastic change.The incidence of molar pregnancy is high in teenagers andin older women. For unknown reasons, frequency ofhydatidiform mole varies in different regions of the world;the incidence in Asia and Central America is about 10 timeshigher than in the United States. The incidence is higher inpoorer classes.\\nHydatidiform mole may be non-invasive or invasive. Two\\ntypes of non-invasive moles are distinguished—complete(classic) and partial. Pathogenesis of these 2 forms is different:\\nComplete (classic) mole  by cytogenetic studies has been\\nshown to be derived from the father (androgenesis) and has46, XX or rarely 46, XY chromosomal pattern. Complete molebears relationship to choriocarcinoma.\\nPartial mole  is mostly triploid (i.e. 69,XXY or 69,XXX)\\nand rarely tetraploid. Partial mole rarely develops intochoriocarcinoma.\\nClinically , the condition appears in 4th-5th month of\\ngestation and is characterised by increase in uterine size,vaginal bleeding and often with symptoms of toxaemia.Frequently, there is history of passage of grape-like massesper vaginum. About 1% of women with molar pregnancydevelop it again in a subsequent pregnancy.\\nThe single most significant investigation  forming the\\nmainstay of management is the serial determination ofβ-hCG which is elevated more in both blood and urine as\\ncompared with the levels in normal pregnancy. Removal ofthe mole is accompanied by fall in β-hCG levels. A more\\nominous behaviour is associated with no fall in β-hCG\\nlevels after expulsion of the mole. About 10% of patients withcomplete mole develop into invasive moles and 2.5% intochoriocarcinoma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.

Grossly,  the uterus is generally smaller\\nthan expected and contains some cystic villi, while part\\nof the placenta appears normal. A foetus with multiplemalformations is often present.Microscopically,  some of the villi show oedematous\\nchange while others are normal or even fibrotic.Trophoblastic proliferation is usually slight and focal.\\nINVASIVE (DESTRUCTIVE) MOLE (CHORIO-\\nADENOMA DESTRUENS).  Grossly,  invasive mole\\nshows invasion of the molar tissue into the uterine wallwhich may be a source of haemorrhage. Rarely, molartissue may invade the blood vessels and reach the lungs.Microscopically,  the lesion is benign and identical to\\nclassic mole but has potential for haemorrhage. It is alwaysassociated with persistent elevation of β-hCG levels.\\nCHORIOCARCINOMA\\nGestational choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant and\\nwidely metastasising tumour of trophoblast (non-gestationalchoriocarcinoma is described on page 748). Approximately50% of cases occur following hydatidiform mole, 25%following spontaneous abortion, 20% after an otherwisenormal pregnancy, and 5% develop in an ectopic pregnancy.Choriocarcinoma follows the geographic pattern ofhydatidiform mole, being more common in Asia and Africathan in the United States and Europe.\\nClinically, the most common complaint is vaginal\\nbleeding following a normal or abnormal pregnancy.Occasionally, the patients present with metastases in theFigure 24.35 Hydatidiform mole characterised by hydropic and avascular enlarged villi with trophoblastic proliferation in the form of masses\\nand sheets.\\nbrain or lungs. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrationof persistently high levels of β-hCG in the plasma and urine.\\nWidespread haematogenous metastases are early andfrequent in choriocarcinoma if not treated; these are foundchiefly in the lungs, vagina, brain, liver and kidneys.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour\\nappears as haemorrhagic, soft and fleshy mass.Sometimes, the tumour may be small, often like a bloodclot, in the uterus.Microscopically,  the characteristic features are as under:\\nAbsence of identifiable villi.\\nMasses and columns of highly anaplastic and bizarre\\ncytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells which areintermixed.\\nInvariable presence of haemorrhages and necrosis.\\nInvasion of the underlying myometrium and other\\nstructures, blood vessels and lymphatics.\\nGestational choriocarcinoma and its metastases\\nrespond very well to chemotherapy while non-gestationalchoriocarcinoma is quite resistant to therapy and hasworse prognosis. With hysterectomy and chemotherapy,the cure rate of choriocarcinoma has remarkably improvedfrom dismal 20 to 70% 5-year survival rate and almost totalcure in localised tumours. The effectiveness of treatmentis also monitored by serial β-hCG determinations. Death\\nfrom choriocarcinoma is generally due to fatalhaemorrhage in the CNS or lungs or from pulmonaryinsufficiency.\\n❑\\n754SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nThe Breast Chapter 25Chapter 25\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe breast is a modified skin appendage which is functional\\nin the females during lactation but is rudimentary in themales. Microanatomy of the breast reveals 2 types of tissuecomponents: epithelial and stromal  (Fig. 25.1) . In a fully-\\ndeveloped non-lactating female breast, the epithelialcomponent comprises less than 10% of the total volume butis more significant pathologically since majority of lesionspertain to this portion of the breast.\\nEPITHELIAL COMPONENT.  The epithelial component of\\nthe breast consists of 2 major parts: terminal duct-lobular\\nunit (TDLU) which performs the main secretory functionduring lactation, and large duct system which performs thefunction of collection and drainage of secretions; both areinterconnected to each other.\\nThe breast is divided into about 20 lobes.  Each lobe\\nconsists of breast lobules  which drain their secretions through\\nits collecting duct system  and opens into the nipple through\\nits own main excretory duct, lactiferous duct.  The segment oflactiferous duct subjacent to the nipple shows a smalldilatation called lactiferous sinus.  Each lactiferous duct has\\nits own collecting duct system which has branches of smallerdiameter, ultimately terminating peripherally as terminal\\nducts  (or TDLU) in the breast lobules.\\nThe entire ductal-lobular epithelial system has bilayered\\nlining: the inner epithelium with secretory and absorptivefunction, and an outer supporting myoepithelial lining, bothhaving characteristic ultrastructure and immunoreativity.The inner epithelium stains positive for epithelial membraneantigen (EMA) and lactalbumin while the myoepithelium ispositive for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and S-100.\\nSTROMAL COMPONENT.  The supportive stroma of the\\nbreast consists of variable amount of loose connective tissue\\nand adipose tissue during different stages of reproductivelife. The stromal tissue of the breast is present at 2 locations:intralobular and interlobular stroma. Intralobular stromaencloses each lobule, and its acini and ducts, and is chieflymade of loose connective tissue, myxomatous stroma and afew scattered lymphocytes. Interlobular stroma separates one\\nFigure 25.1 A, Microanatomy of the breast and major lesions at various sites. B, Normal terminal duct-lobular unit (TDLU). C, SMA-100\\nimmunostain for myoepithelium.\\n755CHAPTER 25 The Breastlobule from the other and is composed mainly of adipose\\ntissue and some loose connective tissue.\\nThe most important disease of the breast is cancer.\\nHowever, there are a few inflammatory lesions, benigntumours and tumour-like lesions which may be confusedclinically with breast cancer. These pathologic lesions aredescribed first, followed by an account of breast cancer.\\nNON-NEOPLASTIC CONDITIONS\\nThese conditions in the breast include inflammations,fibrocystic change and gynaecomastia.\\nINFLAMMATIONS\\nInflammation of the breast is called mastitis. Important types\\nof mastitis are acute mastitis and breast abscess, chronicmastitis, mammary duct ectasia (or plasma cell mastitis),traumatic fat necrosis and galactocele.\\nAcute Mastitis and Breast Abscess\\nAcute pyogenic infection of the breast occurs chiefly during\\nthe first few weeks of lactation and sometimes by eczemaof the nipples. Bacteria such as staphylococci andstreptococci gain entry into the breast by development ofcracks and fissures in the nipple. Initially a localised areaof acute inflammation is produced which, if not effectivelytreated, may cause single or multiple breast abscesses.Extensive necrosis and replacement by fibrous scarring ofthe breast with retraction of the nipple may result.\\nGranulomatous Mastitis\\nAlthough chronic non-specific mastitis is uncommon, chronic\\ngranulomatous inflammation in the breast may occur as aresult of the following:1.Systemic non-infectious granulomatous disease  e.g. as part\\nof systemic  sarcoidosis, Wegener’s granulomatosis.\\n2.Infections  e.g. tuberculosis which is not so uncommon in\\ndeveloping countries like India and may be misdiagnosed\\nclinically as breast cancer owing to axillary nodalinvolvement. Tubercle bacilli reach the breast by haemato-genous, lymphatic or direct spread, usually from the lungsor pleura. Pathologically, typical caseating tubercles withdischarging sinuses through the surface of the breast arefound. ZN staining may demonstrate acid-fast bacilli. Fungalinfection of the breast may occur in immunocompromisedpatients.\\n3.Silicone breast implants  implanted on breast cancer patients\\nafter mastectomy or as breast augmentation cosmetic surgery\\nmay rupture or silicone may slowly leak into surroundingbreast tissue. This incites chronic inflammatory reaction oflymphocytes, macrophages and foreign body giant cells.Eventually, a surrounding fibrous capsule forms and after along period it may even be calcified.\\n4.Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis  is an uncommon form of\\nreaction around lobules and ducts in the absence of any\\nknown etiology. Exact pathogenesis is not known butprobably it is a form of hypersensitivity reaction to luminalsecretion of the breast epithelium during lactation.Mammary Duct Ectasia (Plasma Cell Mastitis)\\nMammary duct ectasia is a condition in which one or more\\nof the larger ducts of the breast are dilated and filled withinspissated secretions. These are associated with periductaland interstitial chronic inflammatory changes. Duct ectasiaaffects women in their 4th to 7th decades of life. The patientsmay remain asymptomatic or there may be nippledischarge, retraction of the nipple due to fibrous scarringand clinically palpable dilated ducts in the subareolar area.The lesion may be mistaken for carcinoma of the breast.The etiology of the condition remains unknown but itappears to begin with periductal inflammation followed bydestruction of the elastic tissue to cause ectasia andperiductal fibrosis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the condition\\nappears as a single, poorly-defined indurated area in thebreast with ropiness on the surface. Cut section showsdilated ducts containing cheesy inspissated secretions.Histologically,  the features are as under:\\n1.Dilated ducts with either necrotic or atrophic lining\\nby flattened epithelium and lumen containing granular,amorphous, pink debris and foam cells.2.\\nPeriductal and interstitial chronic inflammation,\\nchiefly lymphocytes, histiocytes with multinucleate histio-cytic giant cells. Sometimes, plasma cells are present inimpressive numbers and the condition is then termedplasma cell mastitis.3. Occasionally, there may be obliteration of the ductsby fibrous tissue and varying amount of inflammation andis termed obliterative mastitis.\\nFat Necrosis\\nFocal fat necrosis of an obese and pendulous breast followed\\nby an inflammatory reaction is generally initiated bytrauma. The condition presents as a well-defined mass withindurated appearance.\\nGrossly,  the excised lump has central pale cystic area of\\nnecrosis.Histologically,  there is disruption of the regular pattern\\nof lipocytes with formation of lipid-filled spacessurrounded by neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cellsand histiocytes having foamy cytoplasm and frequentforeign body giant cell formation. In late stage, there isreplacement fibrosis and even calcification.\\nGalactocele\\nA galactocele is cystic dilatation of one or more ducts\\noccurring during lactation. The mammary duct is obstruc-ted and dilated to form a thin-walled cyst filled with milkyfluid. Rarely, the wall of galactocele may get secondarilyinfected.\\nFIBROCYSTIC CHANGE\\nFibrocystic change is the most common benign breast\\ncondition producing vague ‘lumpy’ breast rather than756SECTION III Systemic Pathologypalpable lump in the breast. Its incidence has been reported\\nto range from 10-20% in adult women, most often between3rd and 5th decades of life, with dramatic decline in itsincidence after menopause suggesting the role of oestrogenin its pathogenesis. It was previously termed fibrocystic disease\\nbut is currently considered as an exaggerated physiologicphenomena and not a disease. The entity was formerly alsoknown as benign mammary dysplasia  under the mistaken belief\\nthat all forms are dysplastic or  precancerous conditions, andhence has attracted considerable interest.\\nAs such, fibrocystic change of the female breast  is a\\nhistologic entity characterised by following features:i) Cystic dilatation of terminal ducts.ii) Relative increase in inter- and intralobular fibrous tissue.iii) Variable degree of epithelial proliferation in the terminalducts.\\nIt is important to identify the spectrum of histologic\\nfeatures by core needle biopsy or cytologic findings by FNACin fibrocystic changes since only some subset of changes hasan increased risk of development of breast cancer. Presently,the spectrum of histologic changes are divided into twoclinicopathologically relevant groups:A. Nonproliferative changes: Simple fibrocystic change.B. Proliferative changes: Proliferative fibrocystic change.\\nA. Nonproliferative Fibrocystic Changes:\\nSimple Fibrocystic Change\\nSimple fibrocystic change most commonly includes\\n2 features—formation of cysts of varying size, and increasein fibrous stroma. Cysts are formed by dilatation ofobstructed collecting ducts, obstruction being caused byperiductal fibrosis following inflammation or fibrousovergrowth from oestrogen stimulation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the cysts are\\nrarely solitary but are usually multifocal and bilateral.They vary from microcysts to 5-6 cm in diameter. Theusual large cyst is rounded, translucent with bluish colourprior to opening (blue-dome cyst). On opening, the cystcontains thin serous to haemorrhagic fluid.\\nMicroscopically,  simple fibrocystic change includes\\nfollowing 2 features  (Fig. 25.2) :\\n1.Cyst formation:  The cyst lining shows a variety of\\nappearances. Often, the epithelium is flattened or atrophic.\\nFrequently, there is apocrine change or apocrine meta-plasia in the lining of the cyst resembling the cells ofapocrine sweat glands. Occasionally, there is simultaneousepithelial hyperplasia (discussed below) forming tinyintracystic papillary projections of piled up epithelium.2. Fibrosis:  There is increased fibrous stroma surround-\\ning the cysts and variable degree of stromal lymphocyticinfiltrate.\\nB.Proliferative Fibrocystic Changes;\\nEpithelial Hyperplasia and Sclerosing Adenosis\\nProliferative fibrocystic change in the breasts includes 2entities: epithelial hyperplasia and sclerosing adenosis.\\nEPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA. Epithelial hyperplasia (or\\nepitheliosis in the British literature) is defined as increase\\nin the layers of epithelial cells over the basement membraneto three or more layers in the ducts (ductal hyperplasia)  or\\nlobules (lobular hyperplasia).  The latter condition, lobular\\nhyperplasia, must be distinguished from adenosis(discussed separately) in which there is increase in thenumber of ductules or acini without any change in thenumber or type of cells lining them. Epithelial hyperplasiamay be totally benign or may have atypical features. It isthe latter type of hyperplasia which is precancerous and isassociated with increased risk of developing breast cancer.\\nMicroscopically,  epithelial hyperplasia is characterised by\\nepithelial proliferation to more than its normal doublelayer. In general, ductal hyperplasia is termed as epithelialFigure 25.2 Simple fibrocystic change. A, Diagrammatic view. It shows cystic dilatation of ducts and increase in fibrous stroma. There is m ild\\nepithelial hyperplasia in terminal ducts. B, Non-proliferative fibrocystic changes—fibrosis, cyst formation, adenosis and apocr ine metaplasia.\\nC, Proliferative fibrocystic changes showing moderate epithelial hyperplasia.\\n757CHAPTER 25 The Breasthyperplasia of usual type  and may show various grades of\\nepithelial proliferations (mild, moderate and atypical) as\\nunder, while lobular hyperplasia  involving the ductules or\\nacini is always atypical:1. Mild hyperplasia  of ductal epithelium consists of at\\nleast three layers of cells above the basement membrane,present focally or evenly throughout the duct.\\n2. Moderate and florid hyperplasia  of ductal type is\\nassociated with tendency to fill the ductal lumen with\\nproliferated epithelium. Such epithelial proliferations intothe lumina of ducts may be focal, forming papillaryepithelial projections called ductal papillomatosis, or may\\nbe more extensive, termed  florid papillomatosis,  or may fill\\nthe ductal lumen leaving only small fenestrations in it.3.Of all the ductal hyperplasias,  atypical ductal hyper-\\nplasia  is more ominous and has to be distinguished from\\nintraductal carcinoma (page 760). The proliferatedepithelial cells in the atypical ductal hyperplasia partiallyfill the duct lumen and produce irregular microglandularspaces or cribriform pattern.  The individual cells are\\nuniform in shape but show loss of polarity with indistinctcytoplasmic margin and slightly elongated nuclei.4. Atypical lobular hyperplasia  is closely related to\\nlobular carcinoma in situ  (page 761) but differs from the\\nlatter in having cytologically atypical cells only in half ofthe ductules or acini.\\nSCLEROSING ADENOSIS.   Sclerosing adenosis is benign\\nproliferation of small ductules or acini and intralobularfibrosis. The lesion may be present as diffusely scatteredmicroscopic foci in the breast parenchyma, or may form anisolated palpable mass which may simulate an infiltratingcarcinoma, both clinically and pathologically.\\nGrossly,  the lesion may be coexistent with other\\ncomponents of fibrocystic disease, or may form an isolatedmass which has hard cartilage-like consistency,resembling an infiltrating carcinoma.Microscopically,  there is proliferation of ductules or acini\\nand fibrous stromal overgrowth. The histologicappearance may superficially resemble infiltratingcarcinoma but differs from the latter in having maintainedlobular pattern and lack of infiltration into the surroundingfat.\\nPrognostic Significance\\nSince there is a variable degree of involvement of epithelial\\nand mesenchymal elements in fibrocystic change, followingprognostic implications may occur:1. Simple fibrocystic change or nonproliferative fibrocystic changes\\nof fibrosis and cyst formation do not carry any increased riskof developing invasive breast cancer.2.  Identification of general proliferative fibrocystic changes  are\\nassociated with 1.5 to 2 times increased risk for developmentof invasive breast cancer.3. Multifocal and bilateral proliferative changes in the breast pose\\nincreased risk to both the breasts equally.4. Within the group of proliferative fibrocystic changes,atypical hyperplasia  in particular, carries 4 to 5 times increasedrisk to develop invasive breast cancer later. This risk is furthermore if there is a history of breast cancer in the family.\\nGYNAECOMASTIA (HYPERTROPHY OF MALE BREAST)\\nUnilateral or bilateral enlargement of the male breast is\\nknown as gynaecomastia. Since the male breast does notcontain secretory lobules, the enlargement is mainly due toproliferation of ducts and increased periductal stroma.Gynaecomastia occurs in response to hormonal stimulation,mainly oestrogen. Such excessive oestrogenic activity inmales is seen in young boys between 13 and 17 years of age(pubertal gynaecomastia),  in men over 50 years (senescent\\ngynaecomastia), in endocrine diseases associated withincreased oestrogenic or decreased androgenic activity e.g.in hepatic cirrhosis, testicular tumours, pituitary tumours,carcinoma of the lung, exogenous oestrogen therapy as incarcinoma of the prostate and testicular atrophy inKlinefelter’s syndrome (secondary gynaecomastia);  and lastly,\\nenlargement without any obvious cause (idiopathic gynaeco-\\nmastia).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly , one or both the\\nmale breasts are enlarged having smooth glistening whitetissue.Microscopically,  there are 2 main features:\\n1.Proliferation of branching ducts which display\\nepithelial hyperplasia with formation of papillaryprojections at places.2.\\nIncreased fibrous stroma with, myxoid appearance.\\nBREAST  TUMOURS\\nTumours of the female breast are common and clinicallysignificant but are rare in men. Among the important benignbreast tumours are fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumour(cystosarcoma phyllodes) and intraductal papilloma.Carcinoma of the breast is an important malignant tumourwhich occurs as non-invasive (carcinoma in situ ) and invasive\\ncancer with its various morphologic varieties.\\nFIBROADENOMA\\nFibroadenoma or adenofibroma is a benign tumour of fibrous\\nand epithelial elements. It is the most common benigntumour of the female breast. Though it can occur at any ageduring reproductive life, most patients are between 15 to 30years of age. Clinically, fibroadenoma generally appears asa solitary, discrete, freely mobile nodule within the breast.Rarely, fibroadenoma may contain in situ  or invasive lobular\\nor ductal carcinoma, or the carcinoma may invade thefibroadenoma from the adjacent primary breast cancer.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  typical fibro-\\nadenoma is a small (2-4 cm diameter), solitary, well-encapsulated, spherical or discoid mass. The cut surfaceis firm, grey-white, slightly myxoid and may show slit-like spaces formed by compressed ducts. Occasionally,multiple fibroadenomas may form part of fibrocysticdisease and is termed fibroadenomatosis.  Less commonly,758SECTION III Systemic Pathologya fibroadenoma may be fairly large in size, up to 15 cm in\\ndiameter, and is called giant fibroadenoma  but lacks the\\nhistologic features of cystosarcoma phyllodes (see below).Microscopically,  fibrous tissue comprises most of a\\nfibroadenoma. The arrangements between fibrous\\novergrowth and ducts may produce two types of patterns\\nwhich may coexist in the same tumour. These areintracanalicular and pericanalicular patterns (Fig. 25.3) :\\nIntracanalicular pattern  is one in which the stroma\\ncompresses the ducts so that they are reduced to slit-likeclefts lined by ductal epithelium or may appear as cordsof epithelial elements surrounding masses of fibrous\\nstroma.\\nPericanalicular pattern  is characterised by encircling\\nmasses of fibrous stroma around the patent or dilated\\nducts.\\nThe fibrous stroma may be quite cellular, or there may\\nbe areas of hyalinised collagen. Sometimes, the stroma isloose and myxomatous. Occasionally, the fibrous tissueelement in the tumour is scanty, and the tumour is instead\\npredominantly composed of closely-packed ductular or\\nacinar proliferation and is termed tubular adenoma.  If\\nan adenoma is composed of acini with secretory activity,it is called lactating adenoma  seen during pregnancy or\\nlactation. Juvenile fibroadenoma  is an uncommon variant\\nof fibroadenoma which is larger and rapidly growing massseen in adolescent girls but fortunately does not recur after\\nexcision.\\nPHYLLODES TUMOUR (CYSTOSARCOMA PHYLLODES)\\nCystosarcoma phyllodes was the nomenclature given by\\nMüller in 1838 to an uncommon bulky breast tumour withleaf-like gross appearance ( phyllodes =leaf-like) having an\\naggressive clinical behaviour. Most patients are between 30to 70 years of age. Grossly, the tumour resembles a giantfibroadenoma but is distinguished histologically from thelatter by more cellular connective tissue. Later, the WHOclassification of breast tumours has proposed the term‘phyllodes tumour’ in place of misleading term of ‘cysto-sarcoma phyllodes’. Phyllodes tumour can be classified intobenign, borderline  and malignant  on the basis of histologic\\nfeatures. Local recurrences are much more frequent thanmetastases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\ngenerally large, 10-15 cm in diameter, round to oval,bosselated, and less fully encapsulated than a fibro-adenoma. The cut surface is grey-white with cysticcavities, areas of haemorrhages, necrosis and degenerativechanges (Fig. 25.4) .\\nHistologically,  the phyllodes tumour is composed of an\\nextremely hypercellular stroma, accompanied byproliferation of benign ductal structures. Thus, phyllodestumour resembles fibroadenoma except for enhancedstromal cellularity. The histologic criteria used todistinguish benign, borderline and malignant categoriesof phyllodes tumour are as under:\\nfrequency of mitoses;\\ncellular atypia;\\ncellularity; and\\ninfiltrative margins.Figure 25.3 Fibroadenoma of the breast, microscopic patterns.\\nFigure 25.4 Phyllodes tumour. Simple mastectomy specimen shows\\nreplacement of almost whole breast with a large circumscribed, grey-\\nwhite, firm, nodular mass having slit-like, compressed cystic areas (arrow)and areas of haemorrhage.\\n759CHAPTER 25 The BreastAbout 20% of phyllodes tumours are histologically\\nmalignant and less than half of them may metastasise.\\nINTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA\\nIntraductal papilloma is a benign papillary tumour occurring\\nmost commonly in a lactiferous duct or lactiferous sinus nearthe nipple. Clinically, it produces serous or serosanguineousnipple discharge. It is most common in 3rd and 4th decadesof life.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  intraductal papil-\\nloma is usually solitary, small, less than 1 cm in diameter,commonly located in the major mammary ducts close tothe nipple. Less commonly, there are multiplepapillomatosis which are more frequently related to apapillary carcinoma.Histologically,  an intraductal papilloma is characterised\\nby multiple papillae having well-developed fibrovascularstalks attached to the ductal wall and covered by benigncuboidal epithelial cells supported by myoepithelial cells.An intraductal papillary carcinoma is distinguished fromintraductal papilloma in having severe cytologic atypia,pleomorphism, absence of myoepithelial cells, multi-layering and presence of mitotic figures.\\nCARCINOMA OF THE BREAST\\nCancer of the breast is among the commonest of human\\ncancers throughout the world. Its incidence varies in differentcountries but is particularly high in developed countries. Inthe United States, carcinoma of the breast constitutes about25% of all cancers in females and causes approximately 20%of cancer deaths among females. However, there has beensome decline in mortality from the breast cancer in recentyears in North America, Western Europe and Australia dueto both early diagnosis and modern therapy. Cancer of themale breast, on the other hand, is quite rare and comprises0.2% of malignant tumours (ratio between male-female breastcancer is 1:100). The incidence of breast cancer is highest inthe perimenopausal age group and is uncommon before theage of 25 years.\\nClinically, the breast cancer usually presents as a solitary,\\npainless, palpable lump which is detected quite often by self-examination. Higher the age, more are the chances of breastlump turning out to be malignant. Thus, all breast lumps,irrespective of the age of the patient must be removedsurgically. Currently, emphasis is on early diagnosis bymammography, xero-radiography and thermography.Techniques like fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC),stereotactic biopsy and frozen section are immensely valuableto the surgeon for immediate pathological diagnosis.\\nEtiology\\nThough extensive clinical and experimental research as well\\nas epidemiologic studies have been carried out in the fieldof breast cancer, its exact etiology remains elusive. However,based on current status of our knowledge, the following riskfactors are considered significant in its etiology:1. Geography.  The incidence of breast cancer is about six\\ntimes higher in developed countries than the developing\\ncountries, with the notable exception of Japan. Thesegeographic differences are considered to be related toconsumption of large amount of animal fats and high caloricdiet by Western populations than the Asians (including\\nJapanese) and Africans.\\n2. Genetic  factors.  Recently, much work has been done on\\nthe influence of family history and inherited mutations in\\nbreast cancer:\\ni)Family history:  First-degree relatives (mother, sister,\\ndaughter) of women with breast cancer have 2 to 6-fold\\nhigher risk of development of breast cancer. The risk isproportionate to a few factors:\\nNumber of blood relatives with breast cancer.\\nYounger age at the time of development of breast cancer.\\nBilateral cancers.\\nHigh risk cancer families having breast and ovarian\\ncarcinomas.\\nii)Genetic mutations:  About 10% breast cancers have been\\nfound to have inherited mutations. These mutations include\\nthe following, most important of which is br east cancer\\n(BRCA ) susceptibility gene in inherited breast cancer:\\nBRCA 1 gene  located on chromosome 17, a DNA repair\\ngene, is implicated in both breast and ovarian cancer ininherited cases. BRCA1  deletion is seen in about two-third\\nof women with inherited breast cancer having family historybut BRCA1  mutation is uncommon in sporadic cases. The\\nprotein product of BRCA  gene is a cell cycle regulated protein\\nand it can be detected by  immunohistochemistry. Men whohave mutated BRCA1  have increased risk of developing\\ncancer of the prostate but not of male breast.\\nBRCA 2 gene  located on chromosome 13, another DNA\\nrepair gene, in its mutated form, has a similarly higher\\nincidence of inherited cancer of the breast (one-third cases)\\nand ovary in females, and prostate in men.\\nIn both BRCA1 and BRCA2 , both copies of the genes\\n(homozygous state) must be inactivated for development ofbreast cancer.\\nMutation in p53 tumour suppressor gene  on chromosome\\n17 as an acquired defect accounts for 40% cases of sporadicbreast cancer in women but rarely in women with familyhistory of breast cancer. p53 mutation is also seen in Li-\\nFraumeni syndrome having multiple cancers including\\nbreast cancer in young women; others are tumours of the\\nbrain, sarcomas, and adrenal cortical tumours.\\nOther mutations seen less frequently in breast cancer\\ninclude ataxia telangiectasia gene, PTEN  (phosphate and\\ntensin) tumour suppressor gene.\\n3. Oestrogen excess.  There is sufficient evidence to suggest\\nthat excess endogenous oestrogen or exogenouslyadministered oestrogen for prolonged duration is an\\nimportant factor in the development of breast cancer.\\nEvidences in support of increased risk with oestrogen excessare as follows:\\ni) Women with  prolonged reproductive life, with menar-\\nche setting in at an early age and menopause relatively late\\nhave greater risk.\\ni\\ni) Higher risk in unmarried and nulliparous women than\\nin married and multiparous women.760SECTION III Systemic Pathologyiii) Women with first childbirth at a late age (over 30 years)\\nare at greater risk.\\niv) Lactation is said to reduce the risk of breast cancer.\\nv) Bilateral oophorectomy reduces the risk of development\\nof breast cancer.\\nvi) Functioning ovarian tumours (e.g. granulosa cell tumour)\\nwhich elaborate oestrogen are associated with increasedincidence of breast cancer.\\nvii) Oestrogen replacement therapy administered to post-\\nmenopausal women may result in increased risk of breastcancer.\\nviii) Long-term use of oral contraceptives has been suspected\\nto predispose to breast cancer but there is no definiteincreased risk with balanced oestrogen-progesteronepreparations used in oral contraceptives.\\nix) Men who have been treated with oestrogen for prostatic\\ncancer have increased risk of developing cancer of the malebreast.\\nNormal breast epithelium possesses oestrogen and\\nprogesterone receptors. The breast cancer cells secrete manygrowth factors which are oestrogen-dependent. In this way,the interplay of high circulating levels of oestrogen, oestrogenreceptors and growth factors brings about progression ofbreast cancer.\\n4. Miscellaneous factors.  These include a host of following\\nenvironmental influences and dietary factors associated with\\nincreased risk of breast cancer:\\ni) Consumption of large amounts of animal fats, high calorie\\nfoods.ii\\n) Cigarette smoking.\\niii) Alcohol consumption.\\niv) Breast augmentation surgery.\\nv) Exposure to ionising radiation during breast\\ndevelopement.\\nvi) Identification of a transmissible retrovirus in early 20th\\ncentury, mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), also calledBittner milk factor  transmitted from the infected mother-mice\\nto the breast-fed daughter-mice prompted researchers to lookfor similar agent in human breast cancer (Chapter 8). Thoughno such agent has yet been identified, there are reports ofpresence of reverse transcriptase in breast cancer cells.\\n5. Fibrocystic change.  Fibrocystic change, particularly\\nwhen associated with atypical epithelial hyperplasia, has\\nabout 5-fold higher risk of developing breast cancersubsequently.\\nGeneral Features and Classification\\nCancer of the breast occurs more often in left breast than\\nthe right and is bilateral in about 4% cases. Anatomically,upper outer quadrant is the site of tumour in half the breastcancers; followed in frequency by central portion, andequally in the remaining both lower and the upper innerquadrant as shown in Fig. 25.5 .\\nCarcinoma of the breast arises from the ductal epithelium\\nin 90% cases while the remaining 10% originate from thelobular epithelium. For variable period of time, the tumourcells remain confined within the ducts or lobules (non-invasive carcinoma) before they invade the breast stroma(invasive carcinoma). While only 2 types of non-invasive\\ncarcinoma  have been described—intraductal carcinoma and\\nlobular carcinoma in situ,  there is a great variety of\\nhistological patterns of invasive carcinoma breast  which have\\nclinical correlations and prognostic implications. Table 25.1\\npresents different types of carcinoma of the breast asproposed in the WHO classification with some modifications.The important morphological forms are described below.\\nA. NON-INVASIVE (IN SITU)  BREAST CARCINOMA\\nIn general, two types of non-invasive or in situ  carcinoma—\\nintraductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ, are\\ncharacterised histologically by presence of tumour cells\\nwithin the ducts or lobules respectively without evidence ofinvasion.\\nIntraductal Carcinoma\\nCarcinoma in situ confined within the larger mammary ducts\\nis called intraductal carcinoma. The tumour initially begins\\nwith atypical hyperplasia of ductal epithelium followed byfilling of the duct with tumour cells. Clinically, it produces apalpable mass in 30-75% of cases and presence of nippledischarge in about 30% patients.

PAGET’S DISEASE OF THE NIPPLE\\n761CHAPTER 25 The Breastof patients of intraductal carcinoma treated with excisional\\nbiopsy alone develop ipsilateral invasive carcinoma duringa follow-up period of 10 years while the chance of acontralateral breast cancer developing in patients withintraductal carcinoma is far less than that associated with in\\nsitu lobular carcinoma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour may\\nvary from a small poorly-defined focus to 3-5 cm diametermass. On cut section, the involved area shows cysticallydilated ducts containing cheesy necrotic material (in\\ncomedo pattern),  or the intraductal tumour may be polypoid\\nand friable resembling intraductal papilloma (in papillary\\npattern).Histologically,  the proliferating tumour cells within the\\nductal lumina may have 4 types of patterns in differentcombinations: solid, comedo, papillary and cribriform(Fig. 25.6,A) :\\ni)Solid pattern  is characterised by filling and plugging\\nof the ductal lumina with tumour cells.ii)Comedo pattern is centrally placed necrotic debris\\nsurrounded by neoplastic cells in the duct.iii)Papillary pattern  has formation of intraductal papillary\\nprojections of tumour cells which lack a fibrovascular stalkso as to distinguish it from intraductal papilloma.iv)Cribriform pattern  is recognised by neat punched out\\nfenestrations in the intraductal tumour.Lobular Carcinoma in Situ\\nLobular carcinoma in situ  is not a palpable or grossly visible\\ntumour. Patients of in situ  lobular carcinoma treated with\\nexcisional biopsy alone develop invasive cancer of theipsilateral breast in about 25% cases in 10 years as inintraductal carcinoma but, in addition, have a much higherincidence of developing a contralateral breast cancer (30%).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  no visible tumour\\nis identified.Histologically,  in situ  lobular carcinoma is characterised\\nby filling up of terminal ducts and ductules or acini byrather uniform cells which are loosely cohesive and havesmall, rounded nuclei with indistinct cytoplasmic margins(Fig. 25.6,B) .\\nB. INVASIVE BREAST CARCINOMA\\nInfiltrating (Invasive) Duct Carcinoma-NOS\\nInfiltrating duct carcinoma-NOS (not otherwise specified) is the\\nclassic breast cancer and is the most common histologic\\npattern accounting for 70% cases of breast cancer. In fact,this is the pattern of cancer for which the terms ‘cancer’ and‘carcinoma’ were first coined by Hippocrates. Clinically,majority of infiltrating duct carcinomas have a hardconsistency due to dense collagenous stroma (scirrhousFigure 25.6 Morphologic patterns in non-invasive (in situ)  carcinoma of breast.\\nFigure 25.7 Infiltrating duct carcinoma-NOS. The breast shows a tumour extending up to nipple and areola. Cut surface shows a grey white\\nfirm tumour extending irregularly into adjacent breast parenchyma.\\n762SECTION III Systemic Pathologycarcinoma). They are found more frequently in the left breast,\\noften in the upper outer quadrant. Retraction of the nippleand attachment of the tumour to underlying chest wall maybe present.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nirregular, 1-5 cm in diameter, hard cartilage-like mass thatcuts with a grating sound. The sectioned surface of thetumour is grey-white to yellowish with chalky streaks andoften extends irregularly into the surrounding fat(Fig. 25.7) .\\nHistologically,  as the name NOS suggests, the tumour is\\ndifferent from other special types in lacking a regular anduniform pattern throughout the lesion. A variety ofhistologic features commonly present are as under(Fig. 25.8) :\\ni)Anaplastic tumour cells forming solid nests, cords,\\npoorly-formed glandular structures and some intraductalfoci.ii)Infiltration by these patterns of tumour cells into\\ndiffuse fibrous stroma and fat.iii)\\nInvasion into perivascular and perineural spaces as\\nwell as lymphatic and vascular invasion.\\nInfiltrating (Invasive) Lobular Carcinoma\\nInvasive lobular carcinoma comprises about 5% of all breast\\ncancers. This peculiar morphologic form differs from otherinvasive cancers in being more frequently bilateral; andwithin the same breast, it may have multicentric origin.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the appearance\\nvaries from a well-defined scirrhous mass to a poorly-defined area of induration that may remain undetectedby inspection as well as palpation.Histologically,  there are 2 distinct features (Fig. 25.9) :\\ni) Pattern—A characteristic single file (Indian file) linear\\narrangement of stromal infiltration by the tumour cellsFigure 25.8 Infiltrating duct carcinoma-NOS. Microscopic features include formation of solid nests, cords, gland-like structures and intrad uctal\\ngrowth pattern of anaplastic tumour cells. There is infiltration of densely collagenised stroma by these cells in a haphazard m anner.\\nFigure 25.9 Invasive lobular carcinoma. Characteristic histologic features are: one cell wide files of round regular tumour cells (‘Indian file’\\narrangement) infiltrating the stroma and arranged circumferentially around ducts in a target-like pattern.\\n763CHAPTER 25 The Breastwith very little tendency to gland formation is seen.\\nInfiltrating cells may be arranged concentrically aroundducts in a target-like pattern.\\nii) Tumour cytology —Individual tumour cells resemble\\ncells of in situ  lobular carcinoma. They are round and\\nregular with very little pleomorphism and infrequent\\nmitoses. Some tumours may show signet-ring cellsdistended with cytoplasmic mucin.\\nMedullary Carcinoma\\nMedullary carcinoma is a variant of ductal carcinoma and\\ncomprises about 1% of all breast cancers. The tumour has asignificantly better prognosis than the usual infiltrating ductcarcinoma, probably due to good host immune response inthe form of lymphoid infiltrate in the tumour stroma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\ncharacterised by a large, well-circumscribed, roundedmass that is typically soft and fleshy or brain-like andhence the alternative name of ‘encephaloid carcinoma’.Cut section shows areas of haemorrhages and necrosis(Fig. 25.10) .\\nHistologically,  medullary carcinoma is characterised by\\n2 distinct features (Fig. 25.11) :\\ni) Tumour cells —Sheets of large, pleomorphic tumour\\ncells with abundant cytoplasm, large vesicular nuclei andmany bizarre and atypical mitoses are diffusely spread inthe scanty stroma.ii\\n) Stroma —The loose connective tissue stroma is scanty\\nand usually has a prominent lymphoid infiltrate.Colloid (Mucinous) Carcinoma\\nThis is an uncommon pattern of breast cancer occurring more\\nfrequently in older women and is slow-growing. Colloid\\ncarcinoma has better prognosis than the usual infiltratingduct carcinoma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nusually a soft and gelatinous mass with well-demarcatedborders.Histologically,  colloid carcinoma contains large amount\\nof extracellular epithelial mucin and acini filled withmucin. Cuboidal to tall columnar tumour cells, someshowing mucus vacuolation, are seen floating in large\\nlakes of mucin  (Fig. 25.12) .\\nOther Morphologic Forms\\nA few other morphologic forms of invasive breast carcinoma\\nhaving clinical significance have been recognised:\\nPAPILLARY CARCINOMA.  It is a rare variety of infiltrating\\nduct carcinoma in which the stromal invasion is in the form\\nof papillary structures.\\n1. TUBULAR CARCINOMA.  Tubular carcinoma is an\\nuncommon variant of invasive ductal carcinoma which has\\nmore favourable prognosis.\\nHistologically,  the tumour is highly well-differentiated\\nand has an orderly pattern. The tumour cells are regularand form a single layer in well-defined tubules. Thetubules are quite even and distributed in dense fibrousstroma.\\n2. ADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA . Adenoid cystic or\\ninvasive cribriform carcinoma is a unique histologic patternof breast cancer with excellent prognosis.\\nHistologically,  there is stromal invasion by islands of cells\\nhaving characteristic cribriform (fenestrated) appearance.\\nFigure 25.10 Medullary carcinoma breast. Cut surface of the breast\\nshows a large grey white soft fleshy tumour replacing almost whole of\\nthe breast. The tumour is somewhat delineated from the adjacent breastparenchyma (arrow) as compared to irregular margin of IDC.Figure 25.11\\nMedullary carcinoma breast. Microscopy shows two\\ncharacteristic features—large tumour cells forming syncytial arrangementand stroma infiltrated richly with lymphocytes.\\n764SECTION III Systemic Pathology3. SECRETORY (JUVENILE) CARCINOMA.  This pattern\\nis found more frequently in children and has a better\\nprognosis. The tumour is generally circumscribed whichon histologic examination shows abundant intra- andextracellular PAS-positive clear spaces due to secretoryactivity of tumour cells.\\n4. INFLAMMATORY CARCINOMA . Inflammatory\\ncarcinoma of the breast is a clinical entity and does not\\nconstitute a histological type. The term has been used forbreast cancers in which there is redness, oedema, tendernessand rapid enlargement. Inflammatory carcinoma isassociated with extensive invasion of dermal lymphatics andhas a dismal prognosis.5. METAPLASTIC CARCINOMA.  Rarely, invasive\\nductal carcinomas may have various types of metaplasticalterations such as squamous metaplasia, cartilagenous andosseous metaplasia, or their combinations. Development ofsquamous cell carcinoma of the breast parenchyma isexceedingly rare and must be separated from lesions ofepidermis or nipple region.\\nC. PAGET’S DISEASE OF THE NIPPLE\\nPaget’s disease of the nipple is an eczematoid lesion of the\\nnipple, often associated with an invasive or non-invasiveductal carcinoma of the underlying breast. The nipple bearsa crusted, scaly and eczematoid lesion with a palpablesubareolar mass in about half the cases. Most of the patientswith palpable mass are found to have infiltrating ductcarcinoma, while those with no palpable breast lump areusually subsequently found to have intraductal carcinoma.Prognosis of patients with ductal carcinoma having Paget’sdisease is less favourable than of those who have ductalcarcinoma without Paget’s disease.\\nThe pathogenesis  of Paget’s disease of the breast is\\nexplained by the following 2 hypotheses:\\n1.The tumour cells from the underlying ductal carcinoma\\nhave migrated up into the lactiferous ducts and invaded the\\nepidermis producing skin lesions.\\n2. An alternate theory, though less reliable than the former,\\nis that Paget’s disease represents a form of carcinoma in situ\\nof the epidermis itself.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the skin of the\\nnipple and areola is crusted, fissured and ulcerated withoozing of serosanguineous fluid from the erosions\\n(Fig. 25.13, A) .\\nHistologically,  the skin lesion is characterised by the\\npresence of Paget’s cells singly or in small clusters in the\\nepidermis (Fig. 25.13, B) . These cells are larger than the\\nFigure 25.12 Colloid (mucinous) carcinoma breast. The tumour cells\\nare seen as clusters floating in pools of abundant mucin.\\nFigure 25.13 Paget’s diseases of the breast. A, The region of nipple\\nand areola is crusted and ulcerated. B, There are clefts in the epidermal\\nlayers containing large tumour cells (arrow).\\n765CHAPTER 25 The Breastepidermal cells, spherical, having hyperchromatic nuclei\\nwith cytoplasmic halo that stains positively withmucicarmine. In these respects, Paget’s cells areadenocarcinoma-type cells. In addition, the underlyingbreast contains invasive or non-invasive duct carcinomawhich shows no obvious direct invasion of the skin ofnipple.\\nGRADING, STAGING AND PROGNOSIS\\nHistologic grading and clinical staging of breast cancer\\ndetermines the management and clinical course in thesepatients.\\nA. HISTOLOGIC GRADING.  The breast cancers are\\nsubdivided into various histologic grades depending upon\\nthe following parameters:\\n1. Histologic type of tumour.  Based on classification descri-\\nbed in Table 25.1 , various microscopic types of breast cancer\\ncan be subdivided into 3 histologic grades:\\ni)Non-metastasising —Intraductal and lobular carcinoma in\\nsitu.ii)Less commonly metastasising —Medullary, colloid, papi-\\nllary, tubular, adenoid cystic (invasive cribriform), and\\nsecretory (juvenile) carcinomas.\\niii)Commonly metastasising —Infiltrating duct, invasive\\nlobular, and inflammatory carcinomas.\\n2.Microscopic grade. Widely used system for microscopic\\ngrading of breast carcinoma is that of Nottingham\\nmodification of the Bloom-Richardson system. It is based on\\n3 features:\\ni) Tubule formation\\nii\\n) Nuclear pleomorphism\\niii) Mitotic count.\\n3. Tumour size.  There is generally an inverse relationship\\nbetween diameter of primary breast cancer at the time of\\nmastectomy and long-term survival.\\n4. Axillary lymph node metastasis.  Survival rate is based\\non the number and level of lymph nodes involved by\\nmetastasis. More the number of regional lymph nodesinvolved, worse is the survival rate. Involvement of thelymph nodes from proximal to distal axilla (i.e. level I —\\nsuperficial axilla, to level III —deep axilla) is directly correlated\\nwith the survival rate. In this regards, identification anddissection of sentinel lymph node followed by itshistopathologic examination has attained immenseprognostic value ( Sentinel lymph node  is the first node in the\\nvicinity to receive drainage from primary cancer i.e. it stands‘sentinel’ over the tumour).\\n5. Oestrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR).\\nOestrogen is known to promote the breast cancer. Presenceor absence of hormone receptors on the tumour cells can helpin predicting the response of breast cancer to endocrinetherapy (Fig. 25.14) . Accordingly, patients with high levels\\nof ER and PR on breast tumour cells have a slightly betterprognosis. A recurrent tumour that is receptor-positive ismore likely to respond to anti-oestrogen therapy than onethat is receptor-negative.Figure 25.14 Oestrogen and progesterone hormonal receptors (ER\\nand PR) in breast cancer. The tumour cells show nuclear positivity with\\nER and PR antibody immunostains.\\n6. HER2/neu overexpression.  HER2/neu  (also called erbB2 ),\\na member of the family of epidermal growth factors, is a\\ntransmembrane protein having tyrosine kinase activity. Itcan be detected by immunohistochemistry or by fluorescencein situ hybridisation (FISH) and is considered as a goodpredictive marker. An individual having overexpression ofHER2/neu  by tumour cells is likely to respond higher dose of\\nherceptin therapy but is not related to other forms ofchemotherapy.\\n7. DNA content.  Tumour cell subpopulations with\\naneuploid DNA content as evaluated by mitotic markers (e.g.\\nKi-67) or by flow cytometry have a worse prognosis thanpurely diploid tumours.\\nB. CLINICAL STAGING.  The American Joint Committee\\n(AJC) on cancer staging has modified the TNM (primary\\nTumour, Nodal, and distant Metastasis) staging proposed\\nby UICC (Union International for Control of Cancer) and isshown in Table 25.2 .\\nSpread of breast cancer to axillary lymph nodes occurs\\nearly. Later, however, distant spread by lymphatic route tointernal mammary lymphatics, mediastinal lymph nodes,supraclavicular lymph nodes, pleural lymph nodes andpleural lymphatics may occur. Common sites forhaematogenous metastatic spread from breast cancer are the\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 25.2: AJC Clinical Staging of Breast Cancer.\\nStage TIS: In situ  carcinoma ( in situ  lobular, intraductal, Paget’s\\ndisease of the nipple without palpable lump)\\nStage I: Tumour 2 cm or less in diameter\\nNo nodal spread\\nStage II:\\nTumour > 2 cm in diameter\\nRegional lymph nodes involved\\nStage III A: Tumour > 5 cm in diameter\\nRegional lymph nodes involved on same side\\nStage III B: Tumour > 5 cm in diameter\\nSupraclavicular and infraclavicular lymph nodes involved\\nStage IV: Tumour of any size\\nWith or without regional spread but with distant metastasis\\n766SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nlungs, liver, bones, adrenals, brain and ovaries.

PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN BREAST CANCER.\\nBased on current knowledge gained by breast cancerscreening programmes in the West employing mammo-graphy and stereotactic biopsy, various breast cancer riskfactors and prognostic factors have been described. Theseprognostic factors are divided into following 3 groups:\\n1.Potentially pre-malignant lesions.  These conditions are\\nas under:\\ni)Atypical ductal hyperplasia  is associated with 4-5 times\\nincreased risk than women of the same age. Such lesions are\\ncommonest in the age group of 45-55 years.\\nii)Clinging carcinoma  is a related lesion in the duct but\\ndifferent from carcinoma in situ  and has lower risk of\\nprogression to invasive cancer than in situ  carcinoma.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 25.3: Summary of Prognostic Markers and Predictive Factors for Invasive Breast Cancer.\\nFactor Favourable Prognosis Poor Prognosis\\nI.

Breast carcinoma in situ.  Following factors act as\\ndeterminants:\\ni)Ductal carcinoma in situ  (comedo and non-comedo\\nsubtypes) is diagnosed on the basis of three histologic\\nfeatures—nuclear grade, nuclear morphology and necrosis,while lobular neoplasia  includes full spectrum of changes of\\nlobular carcinoma in situ  and atypical lobular hyperplasia.\\nDuctal carcinoma in situ  is more important and demands\\nmost attention. Comedo type of in situ  carcinoma has higher\\nrecurrence rate.\\nii)Breast conservative therapy  is used more frequently\\nnowadays in carcinoma in situ  which requires consideration\\nof three factors for management: margins, extent of disease,\\nand biological markers.  The biological markers such as p53 and767CHAPTER 25 The BreastBCL-2  have low positivity in high-grade in situ  ductal\\ncarcinoma and likelihood of recurrences after conservative\\nsurgery.\\n3. Invasive breast cancer. Prognostic and predictive factors\\nfor invasive breast cancer have been extensively studied by\\nunivariate analysis (examining single factor separately) aswell as by multivariate analysis (comparing the value ofvarious factors included in a study). These can be broadlydivided into 3 groups:1. routine histopathology criteria;2. hormone receptor status; and3. biological indicators.\\nA summary combining all these factors is given in\\nTable 25.3 .\\nOverall, taking the most important parameter of node-\\npositive or node-negative breast cancer, the prognosisvaries— localised form of breast cancer without axillarylymph node involvement has a survival rate of 84% whilesurvival rate falls to 56% with nodal metastases.\\n❑768SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nThe Skin Chapter 26Chapter 26\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe skin or the integument is the external organ that protects\\nagainst mechanical trauma, UV light and infection. Inaddition, the skin is concerned with thermoregulation,conservation and excretion of fluid, sensory perception and,of course, has aesthetic role for appearance of the indidivdual.\\nThe histology of normal skin shows some variation in\\ndifferent parts of the body. In general, it is composed of 2layers, the epidermis and the dermis, which are separatedby an irregular border. Cone-shaped dermal papillae extendupward into the epidermis forming peg-like rete ridges  of the\\nepidermis. Fig. 26.1  presents a diagrammatic representation\\nof the main structures identifiable in a section of the normalskin while  Fig. 26.2  shows the various layers of the epidermis.\\nEPIDERMIS\\nThe epidermis is composed of the following 5 layers from\\nbase to the surface:\\n1. Basal cell layer (stratum germinatum).  The basal cell\\nlayer consists of a single layer of keratinocytes that forms\\nthe junction between the epidermis and dermis. The nucleiof these cells are perpendicular to the epidermal basementmembrane. These are hyperchromatic and normally containa few mitoses indicating that the superficial epidermal layersoriginate from the basal cell layer. These cells are interconnec-ted with each other and with the overlying squamous cellsby desmosomes.  Interspersed in the keratinocytes are\\nmelanocytes , a type of dendritic cells, seen as every tenth cell\\nin the basal layer. These cells have small nuclei with clearcytoplasm containing melanin pigment granules thatdetermines the appearance of an individual. They are alwayspositive with dopa reaction (page 40). The other type ofdendritic cells in the basal layer are Langerhans cells  which\\nare bone marrow-derived cells of mononuclear-phagocytesystem.\\n2. Prickle cell layer (Stratum spinosum, Stratum malpi-\\nghii).  This layer is composed of several layers of polygonal\\nprickle cells or squamous cells. The layers become flat as theynear the surface so that their long axis appears parallel tothe skin surface. These cells possess intercellular bridges ortonofilaments. These intercellular cytoplasmic tonofilamentscontain PAS-positive material that is precursor of keratin.\\n3. Granular cell layer (stratum granulosum).  This layer\\nconsists of 1 to 3 layers of flat cells containing keratohyaline\\nbasophilic granules which are PAS-negative. Granular celllayer is much thicker in palms and soles.\\n4. Stratum lucidum.  This layer is present exclusively in\\npalms and soles as a thin homogeneous, eosinophilic, non-\\nnucleate zone.\\n5. Horny layer (Stratum corneum).  The stratum corneum\\nis also normally devoid of nuclei and consists of eosinophilic\\nlayers of keratin.\\nFigure 26.1 Main structures identified in a section of the normal\\nskin.Figure 26.2 Different layers comprising the normal epidermis.\\n769CHAPTER 26 The SkinIntraepidermal nerve endings are present in the form of\\nMerkel cells  which are touch receptors.\\nDERMIS\\nThe dermis consists of 2 parts—the superficial pars papillaris\\nor papillary dermis,  and the deeper pars reticularis  or reticular\\ndermis.  The dermis is composed of fibrocollagenic tissue\\ncontaining blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves. In the skin\\nof fingers, arteriovenous shunts or glomera  are normally\\npresent. The specialised nerve endings present at some sitesperform specific functions. These are as under:\\nPacinian corpuscles  concerned with pressure are present\\nin the deep layer of skin.\\nMeissner corpuscles  are touch receptors, located in the\\npapillae of skin of palms, soles, tips of fingers and toes.\\nRuffini corpuscles  are cold receptors found in the external\\ngenitalia.\\nEnd-bulbs of Krause  are cold receptors found in the external\\ngenitalia.\\nBesides these structures, the dermis contains cutaneous\\nappendages or adnexal structures. These are sweat glands,sebaceous glands, hair follicles, arrectores pilorum and nails:\\n1. SWEAT GLANDS.  These are of 2 types—eccrine and\\napocrine.\\ni)Eccrine glands.  They are present all over the skin but are\\nmost numerous on the palms, soles and axillae. They are\\ncoiled tubular glands lying deep in the dermis. Their ductspass through the epidermis on the surface of the skin as poresvia which they empty their secretion i.e. sweat. The glandsare lined by two main types of secretory cells: basal,acidophilic,  clear or chief cells,  and the superficial, basophilic,\\ndark granular cells.  The secretory cells are surrounded by\\nmyoepithelial cells.\\ni\\ni) Apocrine glands.  Apocrine glands are encountered in\\nsome areas only—in the axillae, in the anogenital region, in\\nthe external ear as modified glands called ceruminous glands,in the eyelids as Moll’s glands, and in the breast as mammaryglands. Apocrine glands are also tubular glands but havelarger lumina. Apocrine glands have a single layer ofsecretory cells which contain acidophilic, PAS-positive,prominent granular cytoplasm. The type of secretion inapocrine glands is decapitation secretion as if the cytoplasmof the secretory cells is pinched off ( apo = off).\\n2. SEBACEOUS (HOLOCRINE) GLANDS.  Sebaceous\\nglands are found everywhere on the skin except on the palmsand soles. They are often found in association with hair butcan be seen in a few areas devoid of hair as modifiedsebaceous glands such as in the external auditory meatus,nipple and areola of male and female breast, labia minora,prepuce, and meibomian glands of the eyelids. Sebaceousglands are composed of lobules of sebaceous cells containingsmall round nuclei and abundant fatty, network-likecytoplasm.\\n3. HAIR.  The hair grows from the bottom of the follicle. It\\nhas, therefore, an intracutaneous portion present in the hair\\nfollicle and the shaft. The hair follicle consists of epithelialand connective tissue components. The hair shaft is madeup of an outer sheath and pigmented cortex and innermedulla.\\n4. ARRECTORES PILORI.  These are small bundles of\\nsmooth muscle attached to each hair follicle. When the muscle\\ncontracts, the hair becomes more erect, the follicle is draggedupwards so as to become prominent on the surface of theskin producing what is known as ‘goose skin’.\\n5. NAILS.  The nails are thickenings of the deeper part of\\nthe stratum corneum that develop at specially modifiedportion of the skin called nail bed. The nail is composed ofclear horny cells, resembling stratum lucidum but are muchmore keratinised.\\nHISTOPATHOLOGIC  TERMS\\nBefore describing pathology of common skin diseases, the\\nfollowing pathologic terms in common use need to be definedfor understanding of dermatopathology:\\nAcanthosis:  Thickening of the epidermis due to hyperplasia\\nof stratum malpighii.\\nAcantholysis:  Loss of cohesion between epidermal cells with\\nformation of intraepidermal space containing oedema fluid\\nand detached epithelial cells.\\nDyskeratosis:  Abnormal development of epidermal cells\\nresulting in rounded cells devoid of their prickles and having\\npyknotic nuclei. Dyskeratosis is a feature of premalignantand malignant lesions and is rarely seen in benign conditions.\\nHyperkeratosis:  Thickening of the horny layer.\\nParakeratosis:  Abnormal keratinisation of the cells so that\\nthe horny layer contains nucleated keratinocytes rather than\\nthe normal non-nucleate keratin layer.\\nSpongiosis:  Intercellular oedema of the epidermis which may\\nprogress to vesicle formation in the epidermis.\\nPigment incontinence:  Loss of melanin pigment from dama-\\nged basal cell layer so that the pigment accumulates in the\\nmelanophages in the dermis.\\nDERMATOSES\\nDermatosis is a common term used for any skin disorder.Dermatosis may be of various types such as genetic,inflammatory, infectious, granulomatous, connective tissue,bullous and scaling type. A few common examples of eachof these groups are described below.\\nI. GENETIC DERMATOSES\\n1.ICHTHYOSIS.  Two important forms of ichthyosis are—\\nichthyosis vulgaris  and sex-linked ichthyosis.\\nIchthyosis vulgaris  is an autosomal dominant disorder.\\nIt is more common and appears a few months after birth as\\nscaly lesions on the extensor surfaces of the extremities.\\nHistologically,  the characteristic feature is association of\\nhyperkeratosis with thin or absent granular layer.770SECTION III Systemic PathologySex-linked ichthyosis  is a sex-(X) linked recessive\\ndisorder. It begins shortly after birth and affects extensor as\\nwell as flexor surfaces but palms and hands are spared.\\nHistologically,  there is hyperkeratosis with normal or\\nthickened granular cell layer and acanthosis.\\n2. KERATOSIS PALMARIS ET PLANTARIS . The\\ncondition occurs as both autosomal dominant and autosomalrecessive forms. It mainly affects the palms and soles aslocalised or diffuse lesions.\\nHistologically,  there is marked hyperkeratosis, hyper-\\ngranulosis, acanthosis and mild inflammatory infiltratein the upper dermis.\\n3. XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM.  This is an autosomal\\nrecessive disorder in which sun-exposed skin is morevulnerable to damage. The condition results from decreasedability to repair the sunlight-induced damage to DNA.Patients of xeroderma pigmentosum are more prone todevelop various skin cancers like squamous cell carcinoma,basal cell carcinoma and melanocarcinoma.\\nHistologically,  the changes include hyperkeratosis,\\nthinning and atrophy of stratum malpighii, chronicinflammatory cell infiltrate in the dermis and irregularaccumulation of melanin in the basal cell layer. Changesof skin cancers mentioned above may be present inadvanced stage.\\n4. DARIER’S DISEASE (KERATOSIS FOLLICULARIS).The condition is either transmitted as autosomal dominantdisorder or as a mutation. In typical cases, there is extensivepapular eruption.\\nHistologically,  the characteristic changes are hyper-\\nkeratosis, papillomatosis and dyskeratosis. Dyskeratosisresults in the formation of ‘corps ronds’  (present in the\\ngranular layer as a central homogeneous basophilicdyskeratotic mass surrounded by a clear halo) and ‘grains’\\n(having grain-shaped elongated nuclei surrounded byhomogeneous dyskeratotic material) and there isappearance of suprabasal clefts containing acantholyticcells. The dermis often shows chronic inflammatory cellinfiltrate.\\n5. URTICARIA  PIGMENTOSA.  Urticaria pigmentosa may\\noccur as congenital form or may appear without any familyhistory in the adolescents. Clinically, the condition presentsas extensive pigmented macules.\\nHistologically,  the epidermis is normal except for an\\nincrease in melanin pigmentation in the basal cell layer.The characteristic feature is the presence of numerousmast cells in the dermis.\\n6. ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA.  An autosomal recessive\\ndisorder, ataxia appears in infancy, while telangiectasiaappears in childhood. The lesions are located on theconjunctivae, cheeks, ears and neck. These children are moreprone to develop infections, especially of lungs, andlymphoma-leukaemia.\\nHistologically,  the papillary dermis shows numerous\\ndilated blood vessels.\\nII. NON-INFECTIOUS INFLAMMATORY DERMATOSES\\nA very large number of skin diseases have acute or chronic\\ninflammation as a prominent feature. A few selected\\nexamples of non-infectious acute and chronic inflammatory\\ndermatoses which have not been covered in other groups ofdermatoses are given below.\\n1. DERMATITIS (ECZEMA).  The pathologic term derma-\\ntitis is synonymous with the clinical term eczema. Both refer\\nto inflammatory response to a variety of agents acting onthe skin from outside or from within the body such aschemicals and drugs, hypersensitivity to various antigens\\nand haptens etc. Accordingly, clinical types such as contact\\ndermatitis, atopic dermatitis, drug-induced dermatitis,photo-eczematous dermatitis and primary irritant dermatitisare described. Many idiopathic varieties of skin disorderssuch as pompholyx, seborrheic dermatitis, exfoliativedermatitis (erythroderma) and neurodermatitis (lichen\\nsimplex chronica) are also included under this heading. In\\ngeneral, these conditions are clinically characterised byitching, erythema with oedema, oozing and scaling.However, irrespective of the clinical type of dermatitis, thehistopathologic picture is similar.\\nHistologically,  dermatitis reaction may be acute, subacute\\nor chronic:\\nAcute dermatitis  is characterised by considerable\\nspongiosis (intercellular oedema) that may lead to forma-\\ntion of intraepidermal vesicles or bullae. The vesicles and\\nbullae as well as the oedematous epidermis are permeatedby acute inflammatory cells. The upper dermis showscongested blood vessels and mononuclear inflammatorycell infiltrate, especially around the small blood vessels.\\nSubacute dermatitis may follow acute dermatitis.\\nSpongiosis and vesicles are smaller than in acutedermatitis. The epidermis shows moderate acanthosis andvarying degree of parakeratosis in the horny layer withformation of surface crusts containing degeneratedleucocytes, bacteria and fibrin. The dermis containsperivascular mononuclear infiltrate. The classical example\\nof subacute dermatitis is nummular dermatitis.\\nChronic dermatitis  shows hyperkeratosis, parakera-\\ntosis and acanthosis with elongation of the rete ridges and\\nbroadened dermal papillae. Vesicles are absent but slightspongiosis may be present. The upper dermis showsperivascular chronic inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis\\n(Fig. 26.3). The most characteristic example of chronic\\ndermatitis is lichen simplex chronicus.\\n2. URTICARIA.  Urticaria or hives is the presence of\\ntransient, recurrent, pruritic wheals (i.e. raised erythematous\\nareas of oedema). Hereditary angioneurotic oedema is anuncommon variant of urticaria in which there is recurrent\\noedema not only on the skin but also on the oral, laryngeal\\nand gastrointestinal mucosa (page 97).771CHAPTER 26 The SkinHistologically,  there is dermal oedema and a perivascular\\nmononuclear infiltrate. There is localised mast cell\\ndegranulation by sensitisation with specific IgE antibodiesbut no increase in dermal mast cells ( c.f. mastocytosis in\\nwhich there is increase in dermal mast cells).\\n3. MILIARIA.  Miliaria is a condition in which there is\\ncutaneous retention of sweat due to obstruction of sweatducts. There are 2 types of miliaria: miliaria crystallina andmiliaria rubra.\\nMiliaria crystallina  occurs when there is obstruction of\\nsweat duct within the stratum corneum. It occurs in areas ofthe skin exposed to sun or may occur during a febrile illness.\\nHistologically,  there are intracorneal or subcorneal\\nvesicles which are in continuity with underlying sweatducts.\\nMiliaria rubra  occurs when there is obstruction of sweat\\nducts within the deeper layers of the epidermis. It is seenmore often in areas of skin covered by clothes followingprofuse sweating and the lesions are itchy.\\nHistologically,  there are spongiotic vesicles in the stratum\\nmalpighii similar to those seen in dermatitis. Thesevesicles are in continuity with a sweat duct. Adjacentdermis usually shows chronic inflammatory infiltrate.\\n4. PANNICULITIS (ERYTHEMA NODOSUM ANDERYTHEMA INDURATUM).  Panniculitis is inflammation\\nof the subcutaneous fat. Panniculitis may be acute or chronic.Generally, panniculitis appears as nodular lesions,predominantly on the lower legs. The following types ofpanniculitis are described:Erythema nodosum,  acute or chronic, is the most\\ncommon form. The lesions consist of tender red nodules, 1-5cm in diameter, seen more often on the anterior surface ofthe lower legs. Erythema nodosum is often found inassociation with bacterial or fungal infections, drug intake,inflammatory bowel disease and certain malignancies.\\nErythema induratum  is a less common variety. The\\nlesions are chronic, painless, slightly tender, recurrent andfound on the calves of lower legs.\\nHistologically,  the early lesions show necrotising vascu-\\nlitis involving the blood vessels in the deep dermis andsubcutis. In chronic stage, there is inflammatory infiltrateconsisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes and multinucleategiant cells. The infiltrate is located in the septa separatingthe lobules of fat.\\n5. ACNE VULGARIS.  Acne vulgaris is a very common\\nchronic inflammatory dermatosis found predominantly inadolescents in both sexes. The lesions are seen morecommonly on the face, upper chest and upper back. Theappearance of lesions around puberty is related tophysiologic hormonal variations. The condition affects thehair follicle, the opening of which is blocked by keratinmaterial resulting in formation of comedones.  Comedones may\\nbe open having central black appearance due to oxidation ofmelanin called black heads,  or they may be in closed follicles\\nreferred to as white heads.  A closed comedone may get infected\\nand result in pustular acne.\\nHistologically,  a comedone consists of keratinised cells,\\nsebum and bacteria. The hair follicle containing acomedone is surrounded by lymphocytic infiltrate inpapular acne, and neutrophilic infiltrate in pustular acne.Sometimes, the wall of the distended follicle is disruptedso that the contents escape into the dermis where theymay incite granulomatous reaction.\\nIII. INFECTIOUS DERMATOSES\\nMicroorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi are\\nresponsible for a large number of dermatoses. Some commonexamples of each category are described below.\\n1. IMPETIGO.  Impetigo is a common superficial bacterial\\ninfection caused by staphylococci and streptococci. The\\ncondition may occur in children or in adults and morecommonly involves hands and face. The lesions appear asvesico-pustules which may rupture and are followed bycharacteristic yellowish crusts.\\nHistologically,  the characteristic feature is the subcorneal\\npustule which is a collection of neutrophils under thestratum corneum. Often, a few acantholytic cells andgram-positive bacteria are found within the pustule. Theupper dermis contains severe inflammatory reactioncomposed of neutrophils and lymphoid cells.\\n2. VERRUCAE (WARTS).  Verrucae or warts are common\\nviral lesions of the skin. They are caused by humanpapillomaviruses (HPV) that belong to papovavirus group,a type of DNA oncogenic virus (page 224). More thanFigure 26.3 Chronic dermatitis (eczema). The epidermis shows\\nhyperkeratosis, acathosis and broadened papillae and spongiosis of the\\nepidermal layers. The dermis shows mild perivascular chronicinflammatory cell infiltrate.\\n772SECTION III Systemic Pathology100 HPV types have been identified. But it must be\\nappreciated that various types of HPVs produce not only\\ndifferent morphologic lesions but also have variable\\noncogenic potential as summed up in  Table 26.1.  Infection\\nwith HPV is acquired by direct contact or by autoinoculation.Verrucae may undergo spontaneous regression in a few\\nmonths to 2 years, or may spread to other sites. Depending\\nupon the clinical appearance and location, they are classifiedinto different types described below.\\ni) Verruca vulgaris  is the most common human wart,\\ncommonly caused by HPV-1 and 2. The lesions are often\\nmultiple, less than 1 cm in size, circumscribed, firm, elevated\\npapules occurring more commonly on the dorsal surfaces ofhands and fingers.\\nii\\n) Verruca plana  on the other hand, is flat or slightly\\nelevated wart, common on the face and dorsal surface of\\nhands and is usually associated with HPV-10.iii)Verruca planatairs or plantar warts  occur on the sole of\\nthe foot and is caused by HPV-1. They are covered with a\\nthick callus. They may, therefore, resemble calluses or a\\nverrucous carcinoma.\\niv) Epidermodysplasia verruciformis  resembles verruca\\nplana but differs by having familial occurrence with\\nautosomal recessive inheritance. The genome of HPV types\\n5 and 8 have been found in some of these tumours. Epidermo-dysplasia verruciformis is of special clinical significance asit may undergo malignant change, usually into Bowen’s\\ndisease, and occasionally into squamous cell carcinoma.\\nv) Condyloma acuminatum  or venereal wart or anogeni-\\ntal wart  occurs on the penis, on the vulva and around the\\nanus (page 714). They are commonly caused by HPV-6. The\\nlesions appear as soft, papillary, cauliflower-like mass that\\nmay grow fairly large in size (giant condyloma acuminata).\\nIn rare cases, transformation into verrucous carcinoma mayoccur.\\nHistologically,  prototype of verruca is common viral wart\\nhaving following features (Fig. 26.4):\\ni) Papillomatosis (papillary folds).ii)Acanthosis (hyperplasia of stratum malpighii\\ncontaining foci of vacuolated cells in the upper stratummalpighii.\\niii)\\nHyperkaratosis with parakeratosis.\\niv) Clumped keratohyaline granules in the granular cells\\nin the valleys between adjacent papillae.v) Elongation of rete ridges with their lower tips bent\\ninwards.\\nvi) Virus-infected epidermal cells contain prominentvacuolation (koilocytosis) and keratohyaline granules of\\nintracytoplasmic keratin aggregates due to viral\\ncytopathic effects. These cells on electron microscopyreveal numerous intranuclear viral particles.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 26.1: Correlation of HPV Types with Disease.\\nDisease Common Malignant\\nType Potential\\n1.

Foci of vacuolated cells (koilocytes) are found in the upper stratum malpighii. Inset\\nshows koilocytes and virus-infected keratinocytes containing prominent keratohyaline granules.\\n773CHAPTER 26 The Skin3. MOLLUSCUM CONTAGIOSUM.  Molluscum conta-\\ngiosum is a common self-limiting contagious lesion caused\\nby a poxvirus which is a DNA virus. It is more common inchildren and young adults. Infection is acquired by directcontact. Clinically, the lesions are often multiple, discrete,waxy, papules, about 5 mm in diameter and are seen morefrequently on the face and trunk. In a fully-developed lesion,small amount of paste-like material can be expressed onpressing.\\nHistologically,  typical lesion consists of sharply\\ncircumscribed cup-like epidermal lesion growing downinto the dermis. The proliferating epidermal cells containthe pathognomonic intracytoplasmic eosinophilicinclusion bodies called molluscum bodies (Fig. 26.5).  These\\nbodies contain numerous viral particles.\\n4. VIRAL EXANTHEMATA.  Viral exanthemata are a\\ngroup of contagious conditions in which the epidermal cellsare destroyed by replicating viruses causing eruption or rash.There are predominantly two groups of viruses which maycause exanthem. These are: the poxvirus group  (e.g. smallpox\\nor variola, cowpox or vaccinia), and the herpesvirus group  (e.g.\\nchickenpox or varicella, herpes zoster or shingles, herpessimplex). Clinically, these conditions have differentpresentations but the eruptive lesions may look alike andare, therefore, considered together.\\nVariola (smallpox)  has been globally eradicated since\\n1978. The route of infection is via upper respiratory tract ormouth followed by viraemia and characteristic skin lesions.Vaccinia (cowpox)  is primarily a disease of the teats and\\nudders of cows but humans are infected by milking theinfected animals. Varicella (chickenpox)  and herpes zoster\\n(shingles)  are both caused by a common virus, varicella-\\nzoster virus. Chickenpox is transmitted by the respiratoryroute followed by viraemia and successive crops of lesions.Herpes zoster is different manifestation of infection with thesame viral agent after years of latency. It is a disease of thenerves and the tissues supplied by the nerves. The conditionis characterised by sharp burning pain, often dispropor-tionate to the rash. Herpes simplex,  caused by HSV-1, and\\nanother related herpetic infection, herpes genitalis,  caused\\nby HSV-2, are characterised by transmission by directphysical contact and prolonged latency. The vesicular lesionsare often located on the skin, especially the facial skin aroundlips and external nares; other sites are mucosal surfaces andeyes.\\nHistologically,  the characteristic feature of viral exan-\\nthemata is the formation of intra-epidermal vesicles orbullae due to cytopathic effects of viruses. In the earlystage, there is proliferation of epidermal cells andformation of multinucleate giant cells. This is followedby intracellular oedema and ballooning degeneration thatprogresses on to rupture of the cells with eventualformation of vesicles or bullae.\\n5. SUPERFICIAL MYCOSES.  Superficial fungal infections\\nof the skin are localised to stratum corneum (page 183). Theseinclude some of the common dermatophytes such asTrichophyton rubrum  and Pityrosporum.  Clinically, these fungal\\ninfections are labelled according to the region involved. Theseare as follows:\\ni) Tinea capitis  occurring on the scalp, especially in\\nchildren.\\nii)\\nTinea barbae  affecting the region of beard in adult males.\\niii) T inea corporis  involving the body surface at all ages.\\niv) Tinea cruris  occurs most frequently in the region of groin\\nin obese men, especially in hot weather.v) Tinea pedis  or ‘athlete foot’ is located in the web spaces\\nbetween the toes.\\nvi) Onychomycosis  shows disintegration of the nail\\nsubstance.vii) Tinea versicolor  caused by Malassezia furfur generally\\naffects the upper trunk.Figure 26.5 Molluscum contagiosum. The epidermal layers show\\nnumerous molluscum bodies which are intracytoplasmic inclusions. Inset\\nshows close-up view of molluscum bodies.\\nFigure 26.6 Tinea capitis in the skin. The stratum corneum around\\nthe hair follicle shows presence of numerous arthrospores and hyphae.\\n774SECTION III Systemic PathologyHistologically,  fungal hyphae (or mycelia) and\\narthrospores of dermatophytes are present in the stratum\\ncorneum of skin, nails or hair. Hyphae may be septate ornonseptate. Spores are round to oval bodies which growby budding. Special stains can be used to demonstratethe fungi. These are: periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction\\nwhich stains the fungi deep pink to red (Fig. 26.6) , and\\nmethenamine silver nitrate method  that stains fungi black.\\nIV.GRANULOMATOUS DISEASES\\nIn many skin diseases, the host may respond by granu-\\nlomatous inflammation to a variety of microbial agents andnonmicrobial material. Tuberculosis of the skin is the classicalexample in which typical tubercles are formed; otherconditions are leprosy, syphilis, sarcoidosis, deep fungalinfection etc. These conditions have already been discussedin Chapter 6. Nonmicrobial agents which can incitegranulomatous inflammation are keratin, hair, thorns, talc,minerals like beryllium, asbestos and tattoo pigment etc.\\nImportant representative examples of granulomatous\\ninflammation— lupus vulgaris , cutaneous sarcoidosis  and\\ngranuloma annulare , are described here.\\n1. LUPUS VULGARIS.  The lesions of lupus vulgaris, the\\nprototype of skin tuberculosis, are found most commonlyon the head and neck, especially skin of the nose. They areyellowish-brown to reddish-brown tiny nodules (apple-jellynodules).\\nHistologically,  the nodules consist of well-defined\\ntubercles lying in the upper dermis. They consist ofaccumulation of epithelioid cells surrounded by lymphoidcells. Caseation necrosis may be slight or absent.Langhans’ and foreign body type of giant cells are oftenpresent (Fig. 26.7). The condition needs to be distinguished\\nfrom sarcoidosis of the skin (vide infra). Tubercle bacilliare present in very small numbers that are hard todemonstrate by acid-fast staining.\\n2. CUTANEOUS SARCOIDOSIS. Sarcoidosis is a systemic\\ngranulomatous disease of unknown etiology (page 164). Thelesions appear in the lungs, skin, eyes, nose and lymph nodes.Cutaneous manifestations appear as presenting feature inabout a quarter of patients and include erythema nodosum,or brown-red jelly-like papules or plaques with centralclearing. When these lesions are seen around nose, eyes andcheeks they are referred to as lupus perinio .\\nMicroscopically, characteristic feature is the presence ofnon-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas havingLanghans’ giant cells but having paucity of lymphocytes,also called ‘naked granulomas’ (Fig. 26.8) . Fibrinoid\\nnecrosis and presence of intracellular inclusions such asasteroid bodies are some other features which may be seen.\\n3. GRANULOMA ANNULARE.  The lesions of granuloma\\nannulare are often numerous. Dermal nodules are arrangedin a ring-like fashion, commonly on the hands and feet. Thecondition appears to have correlation with diabetes mellitus.\\nHistologically, the centre of the lesion shows a welldemarcated focus of complete collagen degeneration.These foci are surrounded by an infiltrate composedlargely of histiocytes and some mononuclear inflam-matory cells forming a palisade arrangement and aretherefore also referred to as palisading granulomas.\\nV. CONNECTIVE  TISSUE DISEASES\\nGroup of diseases caused by self-antigens or autoimmune\\ndiseases are included under connective tissue diseases. A\\nFigure 26.7 Lupus vulgaris. The dermis contains caseating\\nepithelioid cell granulomas having giant cells and lymphocytes.Figure 26.8 Cutaneous sarcoidosis. The dermis shows non-\\ncaseating epithelioid granulomas having Langhans’ giant cells and paucity\\nof lymphocytes, termed as naked granulomas.\\n775CHAPTER 26 The Skinlist of such diseases along with their etiology and patho-\\ngenesis is given in Chapter 4. Morphology of skin lesions oftwo important representative examples—lupus erythematosusand systemic sclerosis (scleroderma),  is given below. Another\\nconnective tissue disease of unknown etiology, lichensclerosus et atrophicus, is also considered here.\\n1. LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS.  Two types of lupus\\nerythematosus are recognised—a chronic form, discoid lupus\\nerythematosus (DLE)  which is confined to the skin; and a\\nsystemic form, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  that has\\nwidespread visceral vascular lesions. The discoid variety is\\nmore common which is generally benign, while systemicform may be fatal, usually from renal involvement. Thediagnosis is made on the basis of clinical, serologic andpathologic changes. The characteristic cutaneous lesions inDLE consist of well-defined erythematous discoid patchesassociated with scaling and atrophy and often limited to theface. In contrast, cutaneous lesions in SLE are present onlyin a small proportion of cases and consist of erythematous,slightly oedematous patches which are without significantscaling and without atrophy.\\nHistologically,  cutaneous lesion in DLE and SLE may not\\nbe distinguishable in all cases. The important features areas follows (Fig. 26.9):\\ni) Hyperkeratosis with keratotic plugging.ii)Thinning and flattening of rete malpighii.\\niii)\\nHydropic degeneration of basal layer.\\niv) Patchy lymphoid infiltrate around cutaneous adnexalstructures.v) Upper dermis showing oedema, vasodilatation andextravasation of red cells.Direct immunofluorescence reveals granular deposits of\\nimmunoglobulins, most commonly IgG and IgM, andcomponents of complement on the basement membrane ofthe affected skin in both DLE and SLE. High serum titres ofantinuclear antibodies and demonstration of LE cells (page79) are other notable features, especially in SLE.\\n2. SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (SCLERODERMA).  Two\\ntypes of systemic sclerosis or scleroderma are identified: a\\nlocalised form called morphea,  and a generalised form called\\nprogressive systemic sclerosis.  A variant of progressive\\nsystemic sclerosis is CREST syndrome. (C = calcinosis,\\nR = Raynaud’s \\nphenomenon, E = esophageal dismotility,\\nS = sclerodactyly and T = telangiectasia). Etiology andpathogenesis of these conditions are already described(page 80). Morphea consists of lesions limited to the skinand subcutaneous tissue, while progressive systemicsclerosis consists of extensive involvement of the skin andthe subcutaneous tissue and has visceral lesions too. Thelesions generally begin in the fingers and distal extremitiesand then extend proximally to involve the arms, shoulders,neck and face.\\nHistologically,  there is thickening of the dermal collagen\\nextending into the subcutaneous tissue. There ispronounced chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the affectedarea. The epidermis is often thin, devoid of rete ridgesand adnexal structures, and there is hyalinised thickeningof the walls of dermal arterioles and capillaries.Subcutaneous calcification may develop.\\n3. LICHEN SCLEROSUS ET ATROPHICUS . This condi-\\ntion involves genital skin most frequently and is often theonly site of involvement. It occurs in both sexes, morecommonly in women than in men. It is termed kraurosis vulvae\\nin women while the counterpart in men is referred to asbalanitis xerotica obliterans. Occasionally, the condition may\\ncoexist with morphea. Clinically, the condition may simulatemalignancy.\\nHistologically,  the characteristic features are as under:\\ni)Hyperkeratosis with follicular plugging.\\nii)\\nThinning and atrophy of the epidermis.\\niii) Hydropic degeneration of the basal layer.iv) Upper dermis showing oedema and hyaline appear-ance of collagen.v) Inflammatory infiltrate in mid-dermis.\\nVI. NON-INFECTIOUS BULLOUS DERMATOSES\\nThis is a group of skin diseases characterised by bullae and\\nvesicles. A bulla is a cavity formed in the layers of the skin\\nand containing blood, plasma, epidermal cells orinflammatory cells, while a vesicle  is a small bulla less than 5\\nmm in diameter. Blister  is the common term used for both\\nbulla and vesicle. The blister can be located at different sitessuch as subcorneal, intra-epidermal (suprabasal orsubcorneal) and subepidermal. These blisters can appear ininfectious as well as in noninfectious dermatoses. A fewcommon examples of noninfectious dermatoses arepemphigus, pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis anderythema multiforme and are illustrated in Fig. 26.10.\\nFigure 26.9 Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). The epidermis is\\nflat and is devoid of rete ridges. There is hyperkeratosis and follicular\\nplugging. The basal layer shows hydropic degeneration and loss of dermo-epidermal junction (arrow). The upper dermis is oedematous and showsmoderate lymphocytic infiltration.\\n776SECTION III Systemic PathologyHistologically,  superficial subcorneal bullae are found\\nwhich contain acantholytic epidermal cells.\\niv) Pemphigus erythematosus  is an early form of pemphigus\\nfoliaceous. The distribution of clinical lesions is similar to\\nlupus erythematosus involving face.Figure 26.10 Location of bullae and vesicles in non-infectious bullous dermatoses. A,  Pemphigus vulgaris:  The bulla is predominantly suprabasilar\\nin position and contains acantholytic cells. B,  Pemphigus vegetans : An intraepidermal abscess composed of eosinophils is seen.  C, Pemphigus\\nfoliaceous: The bulla is superficial in subcorneal position and contains acantholytic cells. D, Pemphigoid: The bulla containing eosinophilis is\\nsubepidermal with regeneration of the epidermis at the periphery. E,  Dermatitis herpetiformis:  There is a papillary microabscess composed of\\nneutrophils. F,  Erythema Multiforme:  The affected area shows necrotic keratinocytes and inflammatory cells.\\n1. PEMPHIGUS.  Pemphigus is an autoimmune bullous\\ndisease of the skin and mucosa which has 4 clinical andpathologic variants: pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigusvegetans, pemphigus foliaceous and pemphigus erythe-matosus.\\nAll forms of pemphigus have acantholysis as common\\nhistologic feature. Sera from these patients contain IgGantibodies to cement substance of skin and mucosa.\\ni) Pemphigus vulgaris  is the most common type\\ncharacterised by the development of flaccid bullae on the\\nskin and oral mucosa. These bullae break easily leavingbehind denuded surface.\\nHistologically,  the bullae are suprabasal in location so\\nthat the basal layer remains attached to dermis like a rowof tombstones. The bullous cavity contains serum andacantholytic epidermal cells (Fig. 26.11).\\nii)\\nPemphigus vegetans  is an uncommon variant consisting\\nof early lesions resembling pemphigus vulgaris. But later,verrucous vegetations are found on the skin and oral mucosainstead of bullous lesions.\\nHistologically,  there is considerable acanthosis and\\npapillomatosis. Intraepidermal abscesses composedalmost entirely of eosinophils are diagnostic of pemphigusvegetans ( Fig. 24.4,B).\\niii)Pemphigus foliaceous  is characterised by quite\\nsuperficial bullae which leave shallow zones of erythema andcrust.\\nFigure 26.11 Pemphigus vulgaris. An intraepidermal bulla in\\nsuprabasal location containing acantholytic cells (arrow) is seen.\\n777CHAPTER 26 The SkinHistologically,  the picture is identical to that of pemphi-\\ngus foliaceous.\\n2. PEMPHIGOID.  This is a form of bullous disease affecting\\nskin or the mucous membranes. Three variants have been\\ndescribed— localised form  occurring on the lower extremities;\\nvesicular form  consisting of small tense blisters; and vegetating\\nform having verrucous vegetations found mainly in the axillae\\nand groins.\\nHistologically,  the characteristic distinguishing feature\\nfrom pemphigus is the subepidermal location of the non-acantholytic bullae. With passage of time, there is someepidermal regeneration from the periphery at the floor ofthe bulla. The bullous cavity contains fibrin network andmany mononuclear inflammatory cells and manyeosinophils (Fig. 26.12) . Dermal changes seen in\\ninflammatory bullae consist of infiltrate of mononuclearcells, a few eosinophils and neutrophils.\\n3. DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS.  Dermatitis herpeti-\\nformis is a form of chronic, pruritic, vesicular dermatosis.The lesions are found more commonly in males in 3rd to 4thdecades of life. The disease has an association with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (coeliac disease). Both dermatitisherpetiformis and gluten-sensitive enteropathy respond toa gluten-free diet. The pathogenesis of the disease is not quiteclear but probably individuals with certain histocompatibilitytypes develop IgA and IgG antibodies to gliadin which is afraction of gluten present in the flour (page 575).\\nHistologically,  the early lesions of dermatitis herpeti-\\nformis consist of neutrophilic micro-abscesses at the tipsof papillae, producing separation or blister between thepapillary dermis and the epidermis (Fig. 26.13) . The older\\nblisters contain fair number of eosinophils causingconfusion with bullous pemphigoid. Direct immuno-fluorescence shows granular deposits of IgA at thepapillary tips in dermatitis herpetiformis.\\n4. ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME.  This is an acute, self-\\nlimiting but recurrent dermatosis. The condition occurs dueto hypersensitivity to certain infections and drugs, and inmany cases, it is idiopathic. As the name suggests, the lesionsare multiform  such as macular, papular, vesicular and bullous.\\nQuite often, the lesions have symmetric involvement of theextremities. Stevens-Johnson syndrome  is a severe, at times\\nfatal, form of involvement of skin and mucous membranesof the mouth, conjunctivae, genital and perianal area.Another variant termed toxic epidermal necrolysis  consists of\\ndiffuse necrosis of the epidermis and mucosa, exposing thedermis giving the skin a scalded appearance.\\nFigure 26.12 Bullous pemphigoid. The skin shows non-acantholytic\\nsubepidermal bulla containing microabscess of eosinophils (arrow).\\nFigure 26.13 Dermatitis herpetiformis. The tips of dermal papillae\\nshow neutrophilic microabscess (arrow) causing dermo-epidermal\\nseparation at tips.Figure 26.14 Erythema multiforme. There is pronounced dermo-\\nepidermal interface dermatitis. There is oedema and necrosis ofkertinocytes at the junction and mild lymphocytic infiltrate.\\n778SECTION III Systemic PathologyHistologically,  the changes vary according to the clinical\\nmultiform stage.\\ni)Early lesions  show oedema and lymphocytic infiltrate\\nat the dermoepidermal junction. The superfical dermisshows perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.ii)Later stage is associated with migration of lymphocytes\\nupwards into the epidermis resulting in epidermalnecrosis and blister formation (Fig. 26.14) .\\nVII. SCALING DERMATOSES\\nThe skin surface in some chronic inflammatory dermatoses\\nis roughened due to excessive and abnormal scale formationand desquamation. Common examples of this group arepsoriasis and lichen planus. Hereditary ichthyosis havingsimilar scaly lesions has already been described.\\n1. PSORIASIS.  Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory derma-\\ntosis that affects about 2% of the population. It usually\\nappears first between the age of 15 and 30 years. The lesionsare characterised by brownish-red papules and plaqueswhich are sharply demarcated and are covered with fine,silvery white scales. As the scales are removed by gentlescrapping, fine bleeding points appear termed Auspitz sign.\\nCommonly involved sites are the scalp, upper back, sacralregion and extensor surfaces of the extremities, especiallythe knees and elbows. In about 25% of cases, peculiar pittingof nails is seen. Psoriatic arthritis resembling rheumatoidarthritis is produced in about 5% of cases but rheumatoidfactor is absent.\\nHistologically,  the following features are observed in\\nfully-developed lesions (Fig. 26.15) :i)Acanthosis with regular downgrowth of rete ridges\\nto almost the same dermal level with thickening of theirlower portion.ii)\\nElongation and oedema of the dermal papillae with\\nbroadening of their tips.iii) Suprapapillary thinning of stratum malpighii.iv) Absence of granular cell layer.v) Prominent parakeratosis.vi) Presence of Munro microabscesses in the parakeratotichorny layer is diagnostic of psoriasis.\\n2. LICHEN PLANUS.  Lichen planus is a chronic dermatosis\\ncharacterised clinically by irregular, violaceous, shining, flat-topped, pruritic papules. The lesions are distributedsymmetrically with sites of predilection being flexor surfacesof the wrists, forearms, legs and external genitalia. Buccalmucosa is also involved in many cases of lichen planus.\\nHistologically,  the characteristic features are as under\\n(Fig. 26.16) :\\ni)Marked hyperkeratosis.\\nii)\\nFocal hypergranulosis.\\niii) Irregular acanthosis with elongated saw-toothed reteridges.iv) Liquefactive degeneration of the basal layer.v) A band-like dermal infiltrate of mononuclear cells,sharply demarcated at its lower border and closelyhugging the basal layer.\\nVIII. METABOLIC DISEASES OF SKIN\\nSkin is involved in a variety of systemic metabolic derange-\\nments. The examples include the following:Figure 26.15 Psoriasis. There is regular elongation of the rete ridges with thickening of their lower portion. The papillae are elongated an d\\noedematous with suprapapillary thinning of epidermis. There is marked parakeratosis with diagnostic Munro microabscesses in the  parakeratotic\\nlayer.\\n779CHAPTER 26 The Skin1. Amyloidosis (primary as well as secondary, page 82).\\n2. Lipoid proteinosis is rare.3. Porphyria of various types (page 42).4. Calcinosis cutis5. Gout due to urate deposits or tophi (page 853).6. Ochronosis due to alkaptonuria (page 40).7. Mucinosis seen in myxoedema (page 102).8. Idiopathic haemochromatosis with skin pigmentation(page 41).Many of these conditions have been discussed elsewhere\\nin the book; calcinosis cutis is briefly considered below.\\nCALCINOSIS CUTIS.  There are four types of calcification\\nin the skin:\\ni)Metastatic calcinosis cutis\\nii)\\nDystrophic calcinosis cutis\\niii) Idiopathic calcinosis cutisiv) Subepidermal calcified nodule\\ni) Metastatic calcinosis cutis  develops due to hypercal-\\ncaemia or hyperphosphataemia as discussed on page 53.ii) Dystrophic calcinosis cutis  results when there is\\ndeposition of calcium salts at damaged tissue.\\niii) Idiopathic calcinosis cutis  resembles dystrophic type but\\nis not associated with any underlying disease. A special\\nmanifestation of idiopathic calcinosis cutis is tumoral calcinosis\\nin which there are large subcutaneous calcified masses, oftenaccompanied by foreign body giant cell reaction. Calciummay discharge from the surface of the lesion.

Tumours andtumour-like lesions may arise from different components ofthe skin such as surface epidermis, epidermal appendagesand dermal tissues. Each of these tissues may give rise tobenign and malignant tumours as well as tumour-like lesions.Besides these, there is a group of conditions and lesions whichare precancerous. Another group of tumours have their originFigure 26.16 Lichen planus. There is hyperkeratosis, focal hypergranulosis and irregular acanthosis with elongated saw-toothed rete ridges.\\nThe basal layer shows liquefactive degeneration. The upper dermis shows a band-like mononuclear infiltrate with a sharply-demar cated lower\\nborder.\\nFigure 26.17 Idiopathic calcinosis cutis. The subcutaneous tissue\\nshows masses or nodules of calcium salt surrounded by foreign body\\ngiant cells.\\n780SECTION III Systemic Pathologyfrom elsewhere in the body but are cellular migrants to the\\nskin. A comprehensive list of tumours and tumour-likelesions of the skin is presented in Table 26.2 . It is beyond the\\nscope of this book to describe all these tumours and lesions,for which the interested reader may consult specialised workon dermatopathology. Some important and commonexamples of these conditions are considered here.\\nI.TUMOURS \\nAND CYSTS OF THE EPIDERMIS\\nA. Benign T\\numours\\n1. SQUAMOUS PAPILLOMA.  Squamous papilloma is a\\nbenign epithelial tumour of the skin. Though considered by\\nmany authors to include common viral warts (verrucae) andcondyloma acuminata, true squamous papillomas differ fromthese viral lesions. If these ‘viral tumours’ are excluded,squamous papilloma is a rare tumour.\\nHistologically,  squamous papillomas are characterised by\\nhyperkeratosis, acanthosis with elongation of rete ridgesand papillomatosis (Fig. 26.18) . The verrucae,  in addition\\nto these features, have foci of vacuolated cells in theacanthotic stratum malpighii, vertical tiers ofparakeratosis between the adjacent papillae and irregularclumps of keratohyaline granules in the virus-infectedgranular cells lying in the valleys between the papillae(page 772) .\\n2. SEBORRHEIC KERATOSIS.  Seborrheic keratosis is a\\nvery common lesion in middle-aged adults. There may beonly one lesion, but more often these are many. The commonlocations are trunk and face. They are sharply-demarcated,brownish, smooth-surfaced, measuring a few millimeters indiameter.\\nHistologically,  the pathognomonic feature is a sharply-\\ndemarcated exophytic tumour overlying a straight linefrom the normal epidermis at one end of the tumour tothe normal epidermis at the other end. The other featuresare papillomatosis, hyperkeratosis and acanthosis as seenin squamous cell papillomas (Fig. 26.19) .\\n3. FIBROEPITHELIAL POLYPS.  Also known by other\\nnames such as ‘skin tags’, ‘acrochordons’ and ‘soft fibromas’,these are the most common cutaneous lesions. They are oftenmultiple, soft, small (a few mm in size), bag-like tumourscommonly seen on the neck, trunk and axillae.\\nHistologically,  the tumours are composed of loosely-\\narranged fibrovascular cores with overlying hyperplasticepidermis (Fig. 26.20) .\\nB. Epithelial Cysts\\nVarious cysts in the skin may arise from downward growth\\nof the epidermis and the appendages. These cysts oftencontain paste-like pultaceous material containing keratin,sebaceous secretions and lipid-containing debris. Dependingupon the structure of the cyst wall, these cysts are of varioustypes as under:\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 26.2: Tumours and Tumour-like Lesions of the Skin.\\nI. EPIDERMAL TUMOURS\\nA.

These intradermal or subcutaneous\\ncysts, commonly called sebaceous cysts, are common and\\nmay occur spontaneously or due to implantation of theepidermis into the dermis or subcutis (implantation cysts).Most frequent sites are the skin of face, scalp, neck and trunk.\\nHistologically,  epidermal cysts have a cyst wall composed\\nof true epidermis with laminated layers of keratin(Fig. 26.21) . Rupture of the cyst may incite foreign body\\ngiant cell inflammatory reaction in the wall.\\n2. PILAR  (TRICHILEMMAL, SEBACEOUS) CYST.  These\\ncysts clinically resemble epidermal cysts but occur morefrequently on the scalp and are less common than theepidermal cysts.Histologically,  the cyst wall is composed of palisading\\nsquamous epithelial cells. These cells undergo degene-ration towards the cyst cavity. Rupture of the cyst wall iscommon and leads to foreign body giant cell inflammatoryreaction. Calcification in the cyst wall is often present.\\n3. DERMOID CYST.  These are subcutaneous cysts often\\npresent since birth. Dermoid cysts are more common on theface, along the lines of embryonic closure\\nHistologically,  the cyst wall contains epidermis as well\\nas appendages such as hair follicles, sebaceous glands andsweat glands (Fig. 26.22) .Figure 26.18 Squamous cell papilloma.

The border of the elevated lesion\\nat the lateral margin is in a straight line from the normal uninvolved\\nepidermis (arrow). The other features include papillomatosis, hyper-keratosis and acanthosis.Figure 26.20\\nFibroepithelial polyp (acrochordon or soft fibroma).\\nThe epidermis is raised as polypoid mass over dense hyalinised fibrousconnective tissue in the dermis.\\n782SECTION III Systemic Pathology4. STEATOCYSTOMA MULTIPLEX.  This is an inherited\\nautosomal dominant disorder having multiple cystic nodules,\\n1-3 cm in size. They are more common in the axillae, sternumand arms.\\nHistologically,  the cyst walls are composed of several\\nlayers of epithelial cells and contain lobules of sebaceousglands in the cyst wall.\\nC. Pre-malignant Lesions\\n1. SOLAR KERATOSIS (ACTINIC KERATOSIS, SENILE\\nKERATOSIS).  Solar (sun-induced) or actinic (induced by a\\nvariety of rays) keratoses are the multiple lesions occurringin sun-exposed areas of the skin in fair-skinned elderly\\npeople. Similar lesions may be induced by exposure to\\nionising radiation, hydrocarbons and arsenicals. The\\ncondition is considered to be a forerunner of invasivesquamous cell and/or basal cell carcinoma. Clinically, thelesions are tan-brown, erythematous, about 1 cm in diameter\\nwith rough, sandpaper-like surface and are seen more\\ncommonly on the dorsum of the hands and on the baldedportion of the skin.\\nHistologically,  solar keratoses are squamous cell\\ncarcinoma in situ  with the following characteristic features:\\ni) Considerable hyperkeratosis.ii) Marked acanthosis.\\niii)Dyskeratosis and dysplasia of the epidermal cells\\nshowing features such as hyperchromatism, loss ofpolarity, pleomorphism and increased number of mitoticfigures.iv)Non-specific chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate in the\\nupper dermis encroaching upon the basement membraneof the epidermis.\\n2\\n. BOWEN’S DISEASE.  Bowen’s disease is also a\\ncarcinoma in situ  of the entire epidermis but differs from solar\\nkeratosis in having solitary lesion often that may occur on\\nsun-exposed as well as sun-unexposed skin. The condition\\nmay occur anywhere on the skin but is found more often onthe trunk, buttocks and extremities. Clinically, the lesions ofBowen’s disease are sharply circumscribed, rounded,\\nreddish-brown patches which enlarge slowly.\\nHistologically,  the characteristic features are as under\\n(Fig. 26.23) :\\ni)Marked hyperkeratosis.Figure 26.21 Epidermal inclusion cyst. The cyst wall is composed\\nof all layers of the epidermis and has laminated layers of keratin towards\\nthe lumen of the cyst.\\nFigure 26.22 Dermoid cyst. In addition to features of epidermal\\ncyst, dermoid cyst has adnexal structures in the cyst wall (i.e. hair follicles,\\nsweat and sebaceous glands).Figure 26.23 Bowen’s disease. The epidermis is thick with loss of\\nrete ridges but the normal base to surface maturation of epidermal layersis effaced. Instead, there are bizarre atypical squamous cells but theborder between the epidermis and dermis is intact i.e. the basementmembrane is not breached.\\n783CHAPTER 26 The Skinii) Pronounced parakeratosis.\\niii) Marked epidermal hyperplasia with disappearance ofdermal papillae.iv) Scattered bizarre dyskeratotic cells distributedthroughout the epidermis.\\nBowen’s disease, unlike solar keratosis which invariably\\nleads to invasive cancer, may remain confined to the surfacefor many years.\\n3. XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM.  This condition is a\\nhypersensitivity of the skin to sunlight that is determined\\nby a recessive gene. The disorder may lead to multiplemalignancies of the skin such as basal cell carcinoma,squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma.Xeroderma pigmentosum has already been described undergenetic dermatoses.\\nD. Malignant Tumours\\n1. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA.  Squamous cell\\ncarcinoma may arise on any part of the skin and mucous\\nmembranes lined by squamous epithelium but is more likelyto occur on sun-exposed parts in older people. Variouspredisposing conditions include the following:i)Xeroderma pigmentosum\\nii)Solar keratosis\\niii)\\nChronic inflammatory conditions such as chronic ulcers\\nand draining osteomyelitisiv) Old burn scars (Marjolin’s ulcers)v) Chemical burnsvi) Psoriasisvii) HIV infectionviii) Ionising radiationix) Industrial carcinogens (coal tars, oils etc)x) In the case of cancer of oral cavity, chewing betel nutsand tobacco.Cancer of scrotal skin in chimney-sweeps was the first\\ncancer in which an occupational carcinogen (soot) was impli-cated. ‘Kangari cancer’  of the skin of inner side of thigh and\\nlower abdomen common in natives of Kashmir is anotherexample of skin cancer due to chronic irritation ( Kangari  is\\nan earthenware pot containing glowing charcoal used byKashmiris close to their abdomen to keep them warm).\\nAlthough squamous carcinomas can occur anywhere on\\nthe skin, most common locations are the face, pinna of theears, back of hands and mucocutaneous junctions such ason the lips, anal canal and glans penis. Cutaneous squamouscarcinoma arising in a pre-existing inflammatory anddegenerative lesion has a higher incidence of developingmetastases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  squamous\\ncarcinoma of the skin and squamous-lined mucosa canhave one of the following two patterns (Fig. 26.24) :\\ni) More commonly, an ulcerated growth  with elevated and\\nindurated margin is seen.\\nii)\\nLess often, a raised fungating or polypoid verrucous\\nlesion without ulceration is found.\\nMicroscopically,  squamous cell carcinoma is an invasive\\ncarcinoma of the surface epidermis characterised by the\\nfollowing features (Fig. 26.25) :\\ni) There is irregular downward proliferation of\\nepidermal cells into the dermis.\\nii)\\nDepending upon the grade of malignancy, the masses\\nof epidermal cells show atypical features such as variation\\nin cell size and shape, nuclear hyperchromatism, absenceof intercellular bridges, individual cell keratinisation andoccurrence of atypical mitotic figures.\\niii)Better-differentiated squamous carcinomas have\\nwhorled arrangement of malignant squamous cells\\nFigure 26.24 Squamous cell carcinoma. A, Main macroscopic\\npatterns showing ulcerated and fungating polypoid growth. B, The skin\\nsurface on the sole of the foot shows a fungating and ulcerated growth.On cutting, the growth is both exophytic and endophytic and is chalky\\nwhite in colour.\\n784SECTION III Systemic Pathologyforming horn pearls. The centres of these horn pearls may\\ncontain laminated, keratin material.\\niv) Higher grades of squamous carcinomas, however,\\nhave fewer or no horn pearls and may instead have highlyatypical cells.\\nv) An uncommon variant of squamous carcinoma may\\nhave spindle-shaped tumour cells (spindle cell carcinoma).\\nvi) Adenoid changes may be seen in a portion of squa-mous cell carcinoma (adenoid squamous cell carcinoma).\\nvii) Verrucous carcinoma  is a low-grade squamous cell\\ncarcinoma in which the superficial portion of the tumourresembles verruca (hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis,acanthosis and papillomatosis) but differs from it inhaving downward proliferation into deeper portion of thetumour.\\nviii) All variants of squamous cell carcinoma show inflam-\\nmatory reaction between the collections of tumour cells,while in pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia  there is permea-\\ntion of the epithelial proliferations by inflammatory cells.\\nA system of grading of squamous cell carcinoma called\\nBroders’ grading  has been proposed that depends upon the\\npercentage of anaplastic cells present in a tumour (page 204).Accordingly, following 4 grades are recognised:\\nGrade I : Less than 25% anaplastic cells\\nGrade II : 25-50% anaplastic cells\\nGrade III : 50-75% anaplastic cells\\nGrade IV : More than 75% anaplastic cells.\\nHowever, it is important to take into account other factors\\nfor grading the tumour such as: the degree of atypicality of\\nthe tumour cells, presence or absence of keratinisation andthe depth of penetration of the lesion. Therefore, based oncombination of these factors, it is customary with pathologiststo label squamous cell carcinomas with descriptive termssuch as: well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated,undifferentiated, keratinising, non-keratinising, spindle celltype etc.\\n2. BASAL CELL CARCINOMA (RODENT ULCER).\\nTypically, the basal cell carcinoma is a locally invasive, slow-growing tumour of middle-aged that rarely metastasises. Itoccurs exclusively on hairy skin, the most common location(90%) being the face, usually above a line from the lobe ofthe ear to the corner of the mouth (Fig. 26.26) . Basal cell\\ncarcinoma is seen more frequently in white-skinned peopleand in those who have prolonged exposure to strong sunlightlike in those living in Australia and New Zealand (page 221).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the most\\ncommon pattern is a nodulo-ulcerative basal cellcarcinoma in which a slow-growing small noduleundergoes central ulceration with pearly, rolled margins.The tumour enlarges in size by burrowing and bydestroying the tissues locally like a rodent and hence theFigure 26.25 Microscopic features of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The dermis is invaded by downward proliferating epidermal\\nmasses of cells which show atypical features. A few horn pearls with central laminated keratin are present. There is inflammato ry reaction in the\\ndermis between the masses of tumour cells.\\nFigure 26.26 Common location and macroscopic appearance of\\nbasal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer).\\n785CHAPTER 26 The Skinname ‘rodent ulcer’. However, less frequently non-\\nulcerated nodular pattern, pigmented basal cell carcinomaand fibrosing variants are also encountered.\\nHistologically,  the most characteristic feature is the\\nproliferation of basaloid cells (resembling basal layer of\\nepidermis). A variety of patterns of these cells may be seen:solid masses, masses of pigmented cells, strands and nestsof tumour cells in morphea pattern, keratotic masses,cystic change with sebaceous differentiation, and adenoidpattern with apocrine or eccrine differentiation. The mostcommon pattern is solid basal cell carcinoma  in which the\\ndermis contains irregular masses of basaloid cells havingcharacteristic peripheral palisaded appearance of thenuclei (Fig. 26.27) .\\n A superficial multicentric variant\\ncomposed of multiple foci of tumour cells present in thedermis, especially in the trunk, has also been described.\\n3. METATYPICAL CARCINOMA (BASOSQUAMOUSCELL CARCINOMA).  Metatypical or basosquamous cell\\ncarcinoma is the term used for a tumour in which the celltype and arrangement of cells cause difficulty in decidingbetween basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.The tumour masses are composed of malignant squamouscells with horn pearls and the outer row of dark-staining basalcells. These tumours have a high malignant potential andmay occasionally metastasise.\\nII. ADNEXAL (APPENDAGEAL) TUMOURS\\nTumours arising from epidermal adnexa or appendages can\\ndifferentiate towards hair follicles, sebaceous glands andsweat glands (apocrine and eccrine glands). Most of theadnexal tumours are benign but a few malignant variantsalso exist.\\nA. Tumours of Hair Follicle\\nThese are uncommon benign tumours. Two important\\nexamples are trichoepithelioma and pilomatricoma.1. TRICHOEPITHELIOMA (BROOKE’S TUMOUR). Thistumour may occur as a solitary lesion or as multiple inheritedlesions, predominantly on the face, scalp and neck.\\nHistologically,  the tumour is often circumscribed. The\\nmost characteristic histologic feature is the presence ofmultiple horn cysts having keratinised centre andsurrounded by basophilic cells resembling basal cells.These horn cysts simulate abortive pilar structures whichare interconnected by epithelial tracts.\\n2. PILOMATRICOMA (CALCIFYING EPITHELIOMAOF MALHERBE).  Pilomatricoma usually occurs as a solitary\\nlesion, more often on the face and upper extremities. It maybe seen at any age. The lesions vary in size from 0.5-5 cmand appear as well-demarcated dark red nodules.\\nHistologically,  the circumscribed tumour is located in\\ndeeper dermis and subcutis. The masses of tumour cellsembedded in cellular stroma characteristically consist of2 types of cells: the peripheral basophilic cells  resembling\\nhair matrix cells, and the inner shadow cells having central\\nunstained shadow in place of the lost nucleus. Areas ofcalcification are present within lobules of shadow cells inthree-fourth of the tumours (Fig. 26.28) .\\nB. Tumours of Sebaceous Glands\\nTumours originating from sebaceous glands are commonly\\nbenign (e.g. naevus sebaceus and sebaceous adenoma) butsebaceous carcinoma may occasionally occur.\\n1. NAEVUS SEBACEUS.  Naevus sebaceus of Jadassohn\\noccurs mainly on the scalp or face as a solitary lesion that\\nmay be present at birth. Initially, the lesion appears as ahairless plaque, but later it becomes verrucous and nodular.\\nHistologically,  naevus sebaceus is characterised by\\nhyperplasia of immature sebaceous glands and pilarstructures. The overlying epidermis shows papillaryacanthosis.Figure 26.27 Solid basal cell carcinoma. The dermis is invaded by irregular masses of basaloid cells with characteristic peripheral palisade d\\nappearance. The masses of tumour cells are separated from dermal collagen by a space called shrinkage artefact.\\n786SECTION III Systemic Pathology2. SEBACEOUS ADENOMA.  Sebaceous adenoma occurs\\nin middle-aged persons, most commonly on the face.\\nHistologically,  it is sharply demarcated from the\\nsurrounding tissue. The tumour is composed of irregular\\nlobules of incompletely differentiated sebaceous glands.\\n3. SEBACEOUS CARCINOMA.  Sebaceous carcinoma is a\\nrare tumour that may occur anywhere in the body exceptthe palms and soles. Variants of sebaceous carcinoma arecarcinoma of the Meibomian glands of the eyelids (page 511)and carcinoma of the ceruminous glands in the externalmeatus.\\nHistologically,  the tumour is composed of variable-sized\\nlobules of poorly-differentiated cells containing somesebaceous cells. The tumour cells show marked cytologicatypia such as pleomorphism and hyperchromasia.\\nC. Tumours of Sweat Glands\\nA large number of lesions develop from sweat gland\\nstructures, either from apocrine or eccrine glands. These aremore commonly benign but sweat gland carcinoma may alsooccur.\\n1. ECCRINE TUMOURS.  Depending upon the portion of\\neccrine sweat gland from which the tumour takes origin, the\\neccrine tumours are of 3 types:i) arising from intraepidermal portion of the duct e.g. eccrine\\nporoma;ii\\n) arising from intradermal portion of the duct  e.g.\\nhidradenoma; andiii) arising from secretory coils  e.g. eccrine spiradenoma.\\nEccrine poroma.  This tumour arises from intraepidermal\\nportion of the sweat gland duct. The tumour is found morecommonly on the sole and hands.Histologically,  it consists of tumour cells arising from the\\nlower portion of the epidermis and extending downward\\ninto dermis as broad anastomosing bands. The tumour\\ncells are, however, different from squamous cells. They\\nare smaller in size, cuboidal in shape and have deeplybasophilic nucleus.\\nEccrine hidradenoma.  Hidradenoma originates from the\\nintradermal portion of the eccrine sweat duct. The tumourmay occur anywhere in the body.\\nHistologically,  hidradenoma consists of solid masses and\\ncords of tumour cells which may have an occasional duct-like structure containing mucin. The tumour cells are\\nround to polygonal and may have clear or eosinophilic\\ncytoplasm.\\nEccrine spiradenoma.  This is found as a solitary, painful,\\ncircumscribed nodule in the dermis.\\nHistologically , the tumour consists of lobules which are\\nsurrounded by a thin capsule. The tumour lobules contain\\n2 types of epithelial cells like in the secretory coils of the\\neccrine sweat gland. Peripheral cells are small with darknuclei, while the centre of lobules contains large cells withpale nuclei. An occasional area may show glandular\\nstructures.\\n2. APOCRINE TUMOURS.  Apocrine sweat glands may\\ngive rise to tumours; the two common examples being\\npapillary hidradenoma and cylindroma.\\nPapillary hidradenoma.  Papillary hidradenoma or hidra-\\ndenoma papilliferrum is usually located as a small lesioncommonly in women in the skin of the anogenital area.\\nHistologically,  it is a circumscribed tumour in the dermis\\nunder a normal epidermis. Papillary hidradenomarepresents an adenoma with apocrine differentiation andcontaining papillary, tubular and cystic structures. The\\ntumour cells lining these structures resemble apocrine\\nepithelium with features of decapitation secretions.\\nCylindroma.  Also called as ‘turban tumour’ due to its\\ncommon location on the scalp, cylindroma may occur as bothsolitary and multiple lesions.\\nHistologically , the tumour is composed of irregular\\nislands of tumour cells creating a pattern resemblingjigsaw puzzle. The islands are surrounded by a hyalinesheath. The tumour cells comprising the islands consist\\nof 2 types of epithelial cells: peripheral  small cells  with dark\\nnuclei, and inner large cells  with light staining nuclei. Some\\nof the islands may contain tubular lumina containing\\namorphous material.\\n3. SWEAT GLAND CARCINOMA.  Rarely, the eccrine and\\napocrine gland tumours described above may turn\\nmalignant. All  these carcinomas are adenocarcinomas and\\nmust be distinguished from metastatic adenocarcinoma in\\nthe skin.Figure 26.28 Pilomatricoma (calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe).\\nThe tumour shows islands and lobules within the dermis which are\\ncomposed of two types of cells: outer basophilic cells and inner shadowcells. Areas of calcification are also seen.\\n787CHAPTER 26 The SkinIII.  MELANOCYTIC  TUMOURS\\nMelanocytic tumours may arise from one of the three cell\\ntypes: naevus cells, epidermal melanocytes and dermalmelanocytes.\\nBenign tumours originating from naevus cells are called\\nnaevocellular naevi.\\nThe examples of benign tumours arising from epidermal\\nmelanocytes  are lentigo, freckles, pigmentation associated with\\nAlbright’s syndrome and cafe-au-lait  spots of neuro-\\nfibromatosis (page 838).\\nBenign tumours derived from dermal melanocytes  are\\nMongolian spots, naevi of Ota and of Ito and the blue naevus.\\nMalignant melanoma  is the malignant counterpart of\\nmelanocytic tumours.\\nThe important examples amongst these are described\\nbelow.\\n1. NAEVOCELLULAR NAEVI.  Pigmented naevi or moles\\nare extremely common lesions on the skin of most\\nindividuals. They are often flat or slightly elevated lesions;rarely they may be papillomatous or pedunculated. Mostnaevi appear in adolescence and in early adulthood due tohormonal influence but rarely may be present at birth. Theyare mostly tan to brown and less than 1 cm in size.\\nHistologically,  irrespective of the histologic types, all\\nnaevocellular naevi are composed of ‘naevus cells’ whichare actually identical to melanocytes but differ frommelanocytes in being arranged in clusters or nests. Naevuscells are cuboidal or oval in shape with homogeneouscytoplasm and contain large round or oval nucleus.Melanin pigment is abundant in the naevus cells presentin the lower epidermis and upper dermis, but the cells inthe mid-dermis and lower dermis hardly contain anymelanin (Fig. 26.29) .\\nThe important histological variants of naevi are as under:\\ni)Lentigo  is the replacement of the basal layer of the\\nepidermis by melanocytes.\\ni\\ni) Junctional naevus  is the one in which the naevus cells\\nlie at the epidermal-dermal junction. The naevus cells form\\nwell-circumscribed nests.\\niii)Compound naevus  is the commonest type of pigmented\\nnaevus. These lesions, in addition to the junctional activity\\nas in junctional naevi, show nests of naevus cells in the dermisto a variable depth.\\niv) Intradermal naevus  shows slight or no junctional activity.\\nThe lesion is mainly located in the upper dermis as nests\\nand cords of naevus cells. Multinucleate naevus cells arecommon.\\nv) Spindle cell (epithelioid) naevus or juvenile melanoma\\nis a compound naevus with junctional activity. The naevuscells are, however, elongated and epithelioid in appearancewhich may or may not contain melanin. Juvenile melanomais important since it is frequently confused with malignantmelanoma histologically.\\nvi) Blue naevus  is characterised by dendritic spindle naevus\\ncells rather than the usual rounded or cuboidal naevus cells.\\nThese cells are often quite rich in melanin pigment.vii) Dysplastic naevi  are certain atypical naevi which have\\nincreased risk of progression to malignant melanoma. Theselesions are larger than the usual acquired naevi, are oftenmultiple, and appear as flat macules to slightly elevatedplaques with irregular borders and variable pigmentation.Many of the cases are familial and inheritable. Dysplasticnaevi have melanocytic proliferation at the epidermo-dermaljunction with some cytologic atypia.\\n2. MALIGNANT MELANOMA.  Malignant melanoma or\\nmelanocarcinoma arising from melanocytes is one of the most\\nrapidly spreading malignant tumour of the skin that canoccur at all ages but is rare before puberty. The tumourspreads locally as well as to distant sites by lymphatics andby blood. The etiology is unknown but there is role ofexcessive exposure of white skin to sunlight e.g. higherincidence in New Zealand and Australia where sun exposurein high. Besides the skin, melanomas may occur at variousother sites such as oral and anogenital mucosa, oesophagus,conjunctiva, orbit (page 512) and leptomeninges. Thecommon sites on the skin are the trunk (in men), legs (in\\nwomen) ; other locations are face, soles, palms and nail-beds.\\nSome high risk factors associated with increased\\nincidence of malignant melanoma are as under:i) Persistent change in appearance of a mole.ii) Presence of pre-existing naevus (especially dysplasticnaevus).iii) Family history of melanoma in a patient of atypical mole.iii) Higher age of the patient.iv) More than 50 moles 2 mm or more in diameter.\\nMolecular studies in familial and hereditary cases have\\nrevealed germline mutation in CDKN2A  gene which encodes\\nfor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, mutational loss ofPTEN  gene and mutation in several other tumour suppressor\\ngenes but not p53.\\n Clinically, melanoma often appears as a flat or slightly\\nelevated naevus which has variegated pigmentation,irregular borders and, of late, has undergone secondarychanges of ulceration, bleeding and increase in size. Many\\nFigure 26.29 Intradermal naevus showing nests of naevus cells\\nwhich are typically uniform and present in the dermis. Melanin pigment\\nin naevus cells is coarse and irregular.788SECTION III Systemic Pathologyof the malignant melanomas, however, arise de novo  rather\\nthan from a pre-existing naevus. Malignant melanoma can\\nbe differentiated from benign pigmented lesions by subtlefeatures as summed up in Table 26.3 ; the dermatologists term\\nthis as ABCD of melanoma (acronym for Asymmetry, Border\\nirregularity, Colour change and Diameter >6mm).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  depending upon\\nthe clinical course and prognosis, cutaneous malignantmelanomas are of the following 4 types:\\ni)Lentigo maligna melanoma.  This often develops from\\na pre-existing lentigo (a flat naevus characterised by\\nreplacement of basal layer of epidermis by naevus cells).It is essentially a malignant melanoma in situ.  It is slow-\\ngrowing and has good prognosis.\\nii) Superficial spreading melanoma.  This is a slightly\\nelevated lesion with variegated colour and ulcerated\\nsurface. It often develops from a superficial spreadingmelanoma in situ  (pagetoid melanoma) in 5 to 7 years.\\nThe prognosis is worse than for lentigo malignamelanoma.\\niii) Acral lentigenous melanoma.  This occurs more\\ncommonly on the soles, palms and mucosal surfaces\\n(Fig. 26.30) . The tumour often undergoes ulceration and\\nearly metastases. The prognosis is worse than that ofsuperficial spreading melanoma.\\niv) Nodular melanoma.  This often appears as an elevated\\nand deeply pigmented nodule that grows rapidly and\\nundergoes ulceration. This variant carries the worstprognosis.\\nHistologically,  irrespective of the type of malignant\\nmelanoma, the following characteristics are observed (Fig.\\n26.31) :\\ni)Origin.  The malignant melanoma, whether arising\\nfrom a pre-existing naevus or starting de novo,  has marked\\njunctional activity at the epidermo-dermal junction and\\ngrows downward into the dermis.i\\ni) Tumour cells.  The malignant melanoma cells are\\nusually larger than the naevus cells.

Rarely, the primarylesion regresses spontaneously but metastases are presentwidely distributed.\\nIV.TUMOURS OF THE DERMIS\\nAll the tissue elements of the dermis such as fibrous tissue,\\nadipose tissue, neural tissue, endothelium and smoothmuscle are capable of transforming into benign andmalignant tumours. Many of the examples of these tumoursare discussed in Chapter 29 but a few representative dermalneoplasms are described below.\\n1. DERMATOFIBROMA AND MALIGNANT FIBROUS\\nHISTIOCYTOMA.  These soft tissue tumours are composed\\nof cells having mixed features of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts,histiocytes and primitive mesenchymal cells. Thehistogenesis of these tumours is not quite clear but probablythey arise from multi-directional differentiation of theprimitive mesenchymal cells. The tumours appear at any agebut are more common in advanced age. The commonest sitesare the lower and upper extremities, followed in decreasingfrequency, by abdominal cavity and retroperitoneum. Thebenign variant is also known by various synonyms likedermatofibroma, histiocytoma, sclerosing haemangioma,fibroxanthoma and xanthogranuloma. Benign histiocytomasare often small but malignant fibrous histiocytomas may beof enormous size. They are circumscribed but unencapsu-lated.\\nHistologically,  the tumours are composed of spindle-\\nshaped fibrohistiocytoid cells which are characteristicallyarranged in cartwheel or storiform pattern. The benignvariety contains uniform spindle-shaped cells withadmixture of numerous foamy histiocytes. The malignantfibrous histiocytoma shows pleomorphic tumour cells andsome multinucleate giant cells in a stroma that may showmyxoid change and inflammatory infiltrate.\\n2. DERMATOFIBROSARCOMA PROTUBERANS . This\\nis a low-grade fibrosarcoma that rarely metastasises but islocally recurrent. The tumour usually forms a solid nodule,within the dermis and subcutaneous fat, protruding theepidermis outwards. Sometimes multiple nodules may form.\\nHistologically,  the tumour is very cellular and is\\ncomposed of uniform fibroblasts arranged in a cartwheelor storiform pattern. A few mitoses are often present. Theoverlying epidermis is generally thinned and may beulcerated  (Fig. 26.32) . The subcutaneous fat is frequently\\ninvaded by the tumour cells.\\n3. XANTHOMAS.  These are solitary or multiple tumour-\\nlike lesions, often associated with high levels of serumcholesterol and phospholipids. Many of the cases result fromfamilial hyperlipidaemia. They may occur at different sitessuch as buttocks, knees, elbows, tendo-Achilles, palmarcreases and on the eyelids (referred to as xanthelasma).\\nHistologically,  xanthomas are composed of dermal collec-\\ntions of benign-appearing foamy histiocytes. Multi-Figure 26.31 Malignant melanoma shows  junctional activity at the dermal-epidermal junction. Tumour cells resembling epithelioid cells with\\npleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli are seen as solid masses in the dermis. Many of the tumour cells contain fine granula r melanin pigment.\\nPhotomicrograph shows a prominent atypical mitotic figure (arrow).\\n790SECTION III Systemic Pathologynucleate tumour giant cells surrounded by lipid-laden\\ncytoplasm are often present.\\nV. CELLULAR MIGRANT TUMOURS\\nAll the tumours described above arise from progenitor cells\\nin the skin only. However, there are some tumours whichhave their precursor cells elsewhere in the body, but arecellular immigrants to the skin. The examples areLangerhans’ cell histiocytosis (page 385), mycosis fungoides,mastocytosis, lymphomas and leukaemias (Chapter 14).Mycosis fungoides is considered here.\\nMYCOSIS FUNGOIDES (CUTANEOUS T-CELL\\nLYMPHOMA) AND SEZARY SYNDROME.  Mycosis\\nfungoides or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is thecommonest form of lymphoma in the skin but in advancedFigure 26.32 Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. The tumour cells\\nare arranged in storiform or cartwheel pattern. The tumour cells are\\nspindled admixed with histiocytes and show moderate anisocytosis andanisonucleosis.stage, mycosis fungoides may disseminate to the lymph\\nnodes and other organs. Clinically, mycosis fungoides maymanifest in 3 stages:\\ni) Premycotic stage  in which the lesions are erythematous,\\nred-brown, scaly and pruritic, resembling eczema or\\npsoriasis.\\nii) Infiltrative  stage  has slightly elevated, bluish-red, firm\\nplaques.iii)Fungoid (Tumour) stage  is characterised by red-brown\\nnodules of tumour which often undergo ulceration.\\nThe etiology of mycosis fungoides or CTCL has been\\nfound to be the same as for adult T cell lymphoma-leukaemia\\nsyndrome which is human T cell-leukaemia virus-I (HTLV-I) as discussed on page 227.\\nSézary syndrome  is a variant of CTCL, often due to\\ndissemination of underlying CTCL to the blood and infil-tration into the skin causing generalised erythroderma,lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.\\nThe condition is found more frequently beyond 4th\\ndecade of life. Lesions may affect different body surfaces butoften involve the trunk, extremities, face and scalp.\\nHistologically,  the condition has the following charac-\\nteristics:i) Initially, lower portion of the epidermis containshyperchromatic enlarged lymphocytes. In about half thecases, there is formation of intraepidermal clusters ofatypical lymphoid cells forming Darier-Pautrier’s\\nmicroabscesses  which is a misnomer as it does not contain\\npus cells.ii) Later, there are band-like sharply demarcatedaggregates of polymorphous cellular infiltrate in thedermis including atypical lymphoid cells (Sézary-Lutznercells) and multinucleated cells.iii) The individual mycosis cells are malignant T lympho-cytes which have hyperchromatic and cerebriform nucleiand express CD4 and HLA-DR antigen.\\n❑\\n791CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine System\\nThe Endocrine System Chapter 27Chapter 27\\nENDOCRINES: THE BASIC CONCEPT\\nThe development, structure and functions of human body\\nare governed and maintained by 2 mutually interlinkedsystems— the endocrine system  and the nervous system (Chapter\\n30); a third system combining features of both these systemsis appropriately called neuroendocrine system .\\nNEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM\\nThis system forms a link between the endocrine and nervous\\nsystems. The cells of this system elaborate polypeptidehormones; owing to these biochemical properties, it has alsobeen called as APUD cell system (acronym for Amine\\nPrecursor Uptake and Decarboxylation properties).\\nHowever, though having common biochemical properties,the cells of this system are widely distributed in the body indifferent anatomic areas and hence is currently calleddispersed neuroendocrine system .  Cells comprising this system\\nare as under:1. Neuroendocrine cells  are present in the gastric and intestinal\\nmucosa and elaborate peptide hormones.2. Neuroganglia cells  lie in the ganglia cells in the sympathetic\\nchain and elaborate amines.3. Adrenal \\nmedulla  elaborates epinephrine and norepinephrine.\\n4. Parafollicular C cells  of the thyroid secrete calcitonin.\\n5. Islets of Langerhans  in the pancreas (included in both\\nendocrine and neuroendocrine systems) secrete insulin.6. Isolated cells in the left atrium  of the heart secrete atrial\\nnatriuretic (salt-losing) peptide hormone.\\nIn addition to above, other non-endocrine secretions\\ninclude neurotransmitter substances such as acetylcholine and\\ndopamin e released from neural synapses, and erythropoietin\\nand vitamin D\\n3 elaborated from the kidney.\\nTHE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM\\nAnatomically, the endocrine system consists of 6 distinct\\norgans: pituitary, adrenals, thyroid, parathyroids, gonads,and pancreatic islets; the last one is included in neuro-endocrine system also). Understanding the patholgy of theseendocrine organs requires the knowledge of overall frame-work of hormone secretions, their actions and broadprinciples of feedback mechanisms.\\nBroadly speaking, human hormones are divided  into 5\\nmajor classes which are further grouped under two headingsdepending upon their site of interactions on the target cellreceptors (whether cell membrane or nuclear receptor):Group I: Those interacting with cell-surface membranereceptors:\\n1.Amino acid derivatives:  thyroid hormone, catecholamines.\\n2.Small neuropeptides: gonadotropin-releasing hormone\\n(GnRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), somatostatin,\\nvasopressin.\\nGroup II: Those interacting with intracellular nuclear\\nreceptors:\\n3. Large proteins: insulin, luteinising hormone (LH), para-\\nthormone hormone.\\n4. Steroid hormones: cortisol, estrogen.\\n5. Vitamin derivatives: retinol (vitamin A) and vitamin D.\\nThe synthesis  of these hormones and their precursors takes\\nplace through a prescribed genetic pathway that involves:transcription  → mRNA  → protein synthesis  → post-\\ntranslational protein processing  → intracellular sorting/\\nmembrane integration  → secretion.\\nMajor functions  of hormones are as under:\\ni) Growth and differentiation of cells: by pituitary hormones,\\nthyroid, parathyroid, steroid hormones.ii) Maintenance of homeostasis: thyroid (by regulating BMR),\\nparathormone, mineralocorticoids, vasopressin, insulin.iii) Reproduction: sexual development and activity, pregnancy,\\nfoetal development, menopause etc.\\nA basic feature of all endocrine glands is the existence of\\nboth negative and positive feedback control system  that\\nstimulates  or regulates  hormone production in a way that levels\\nremain within the normal range (abbreviated as S or Rrespectively with the corresponding  hormone e.g. TSH-TRHpathway, GnRH-LH/FSH pathway etc). This system iscommonly termed hypothalamic-pituitary hormone axis for\\ndifferent hormones schematically illustrated in Fig. 27.1. The\\nstimulatory or regulatory action by endocrine hormonalsecretions may follow paracrine or autocrine pathways:\\nParacrine regulation means that the stimulatory/\\nregulatory factors are released by one type of cells but act onanother adjacent cell of the system.\\nAutocrine regulation  refers to action of the factor on the\\nsame cell that produced it.\\nWith this brief overview of principles of physiology of\\nhormones, we now turn to the study of diseases of theendocrine organs. In general, pathologic processes affectingendocrine glands with resultant hormonal abnormalities mayoccur from following processes:\\nHyperfunction: This results from excess of hormone secreting\\ntissues e.g. hyperplasia, tumours (adenoma, carcinoma),\\nectopic hormone production, excessive stimulation from792SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\ninflammation (often autoimmune), infections, iatrogenic\\n(drugs-induced, hormonal administration).\\nHypofunction: Deficiency of hormones occurs from\\ndestruction of hormone-forming tissues from inflammations\\n(often autoimmune), infections, iatrogenic (e.g. surgicalremoval, radiation damage), developmental defects (e.g.Turner’s syndrome, hypoplasia), enzyme deficiency,haemorrhage and infarction (e.g. Sheehan’s syndrome),nutritional deficiency (e.g. iodine deficiency).\\nHormone resistance: There may be adequate or excessive\\nproduction of a hormone but there is peripheral resistance,\\noften from inherited mutations in receptors (e.g. defect inmembrane receptors, nuclear receptors or receptor for signaltransduction).\\nPITUITARY GLAND\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nANATOMY.  The pituitary gland or hypophysis in an adult\\nweighs about 500 mg and is slightly heavier in females. It is\\nsituated at the base of the brain in a hollow called sella turcica\\nformed out of the sphenoid bone. The gland is composed of2 major anatomic divisions: anterior lobe (adenohypophysis)and posterior lobe (neurohypophysis).Figure 27.1 Endocrine organs and the presence of feedback controls. Both positive and negative feedback controls exist for each endocrine\\ngland having a regulating (R) and stimulating (S) hormone. Those acting through hypothalamic-pituitary axis include: thyroid ho rmones on TRH-\\nTSH axis, cortisol on CRH-ACTH axis, gonadal steroids on GnRH-LH/FSH axis and insulin-like GH on GHRH-GH axis. Those independen t of\\npituitary control (shown by interrupted arrows) have also feedback controls by calcium on PTH, and hypoglycaemia on insulin rel ease by pancreatic\\nislets.\\n793CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine System1. The  anterior lobe or adenohypophysis  is an ectodermal\\nderivative formed from Rathke’s pouch which is an upward\\ndiverticulum from the primitive buccal cavity. Theadenohypophysis has no direct neural connection but hasindirect connection through capillary portal circulation bywhich the anterior pituitary receives the blood which hasalready passed through the hypothalamus.\\n2. The posterior lobe or neurohypophysis  is a downgrowth\\nfrom the primitive neural tissue. The neurohypophysis,\\ntherefore, has direct neural connection superiorly with thehypothalamus.\\nHISTOLOGY  AND FUNCTIONS.  The histology and\\nfunctions of the anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary\\ngland are quite distinct.\\nA. ANTERIOR LOBE (ADENOHYPOPHYSIS) . It is com-\\nposed of round to polygonal epithelial cells arranged in cords\\nand islands having fibrovascular stroma. These epithelialcells, depending upon their staining characteristics andfunctions, are divided into 3 types, each of which performsseparate functions:\\n1.Chromophil cells with acidophilic granules:  These cells\\ncomprise about 40% of the anterior lobe and are chiefly\\nlocated in the lateral wings. The acidophils are further of 2types:\\ni)Somatotrophs (GH cells)  which produce growth hormone\\n(GH).\\nii)Lactotrophs (PRL cells)  which produce prolactin (PRL).\\nCells containing both GH and PRL called mammo-\\nsomatotrophs  are also present.\\n2. Chromophil cells with basophilic granules: These cells\\nconstitute about 10% of the anterior lobe and are mainly\\nfound in the region of median wedge. The chromatophilsinclude 3 types of cells:\\ni)Gonadotrophs (FSH-LH cells)  which are the source of the\\nFSH and LH or interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH).ii)Thyrotrophs (TSH cells)  are the cells producing TSH.\\niii)Corticotrophs (ACTH-MSH cells)  produce ACTH,\\nmelanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), β-lipoprotein and\\nβ-endorphin.\\n3\\n. Chromophobe cells without visible granules:  These cells\\ncomprise the remainder 50% of the adenohypophysis. These\\ncells by light microscopy contain no visible granules, but onelectron microscopy reveal sparsely granulated cortico-trophs, thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs.\\nAll these functions of the adenohypophysis are under the\\nindirect control  of the hypothalamus through stimulatory and\\ninhibitory factors synthesised by the hypothalamus whichreach the anterior lobe through capillary portal blood.\\nB. POSTERIOR LOBE (NEUROHYPOPHYSIS) . The\\nneurohypophysis is composed mainly of interlacing nerve\\nfibres in which are scattered specialised glial cells calledpituicytes.  These nerve fibres on electron microscopy contain\\ngranules of neurosecretory material made up of 2octapeptides— vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone  (ADH), and\\noxytocin,  both of which are produced by neurosecretory cellsof the hypothalamus but are stored in the cells of posteriorpituitary.\\n1.ADH  causes reabsorption of water from the renal tubules\\nand is essential for maintenance of osmolality of the plasma.\\nIts deficiency results in diabetes insipidus characterised byuncontrolled diuresis and polydipsia.\\n2.Oxytocin  causes contraction of mammary myoepithelial\\ncells resulting in ejection of milk from the lactating breast\\nand causes contraction of myometrium of the uterus at term.\\nIt is obvious from the description above that pituitary,\\nthough a tiny organ, is concerned with a variety of diversefunctions in the body. The pituitary gland and hypothalamusare so closely interlinked that diseases of the pituitary glandinvolve the hypothalamus, and dysfunctions of thehypothalamus cause secondary changes in the pituitary. Thepituitary gland is involved in several diseases which include:non-neoplastic (e.g. inflammations, haemorrhage, trauma,\\ninfarction and many other endocrine diseases) and neoplastic\\ndiseases. However, functionally and morphologically,diseases of the pituitary can be classified as below, each ofwhich includes diseases of the anterior and posteriorpituitary and the hypothalamus, separately:\\ni)\\nHyperpituitarism\\nii) Hypopituitarism\\niii) Pituitary tumours\\nHYPERPITUITARISM\\nHyperpituitarism is characterised by oversecretion of one or\\nmore of the pituitary hormones. Such hypersecretion maybe due to diseases of the anterior pituitary, posterior pituitaryor hypothalamus. For all practical purposes, however,hyperfunction of the anterior pituitary is due to thedevelopment of a hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma(discussed later), and rarely, a carcinoma. For each of thehormonal hyperfunction of the anterior pituitary, posteriorpituitary and hypothalamus, a clinical syndrome is described.A few important syndromes are as follows:\\nA. Hyperfunction of Anterior Pituitary\\nThree common syndromes of adenohypophyseal hyper-\\nfunction are: gigantism and acromegaly, hyperprolacti-naemia and Cushing’s syndrome.\\nGIGANTISM AND ACROMEGALY.  Both these clinical\\nsyndromes result from sustained excess of growth hormone\\n(GH), most commonly by somatotroph (GH-secreting)adenoma.\\nGigantism.  When GH excess occurs prior to epiphyseal\\nclosure, gigantism is produced. Gigantism, therefore, occurs\\nin prepubertal boys and girls and is much less frequent thanacromegaly. The main clinical feature in gigantism is theexcessive and proportionate growth of the child. There isenlargement as well as thickening of the bones resulting inconsiderable increase in height and enlarged thoracic cage.\\nAcromegaly.  Acromegaly results when there is overproduc-\\ntion of GH in adults following cessation of bone growth and794SECTION III Systemic Pathologyis more common than gigantism. The term ‘acromegaly’\\nmeans increased growth of extremities ( acro=extremity).\\nThere is enlargement of hands and feet, coarseness of facialfeatures with increase in soft tissues, prominent supraorbitalridges and a more prominent lower jaw which when clenchedresults in protrusion of the lower teeth in front of upper teeth(prognathism). Other features include enlargement of the\\ntongue and lips, thickening of the skin and kyphosis.Sometimes, a few associated features such as TSH excessresulting in thyrotoxicosis, and gonadotropin insufficiencycausing amenorrhoea in the females and impotence in themale, are found.\\nHYPERPROLACTINAEMIA.  Hyperprolactinaemia is the\\nexcessive production of prolactin (PRL), most commonly by\\nlactotroph (PRL-secreting) adenoma, also called prolac-tinoma. Occasionally, hyperprolactinaemia results fromhypothalamic inhibition of PRL secretion by certain drugs(e.g. chlorpromazine, reserpine and methyl-dopa). In thefemale, hyperprolactinaemia causes amenorrhoea-galactorrhoea\\nsyndrome characterised clinically by infertility and expressionof a drop or two of milk from breast, not related to pregnancyor puerperium. In the male, it may cause impotence  or reduced\\nlibido.  These features result either from associated inhibition\\nof gonadotropin secretion or interference in gonadotropineffects.\\nCUSHING’S SYNDROME.  Pituitary-dependent Cushing’s\\nsyndrome results from ACTH excess. Most frequently, it is\\ncaused by corticotroph (ACTH-secreting) adenoma.Cushing’s syndrome is discussed under diseases of theadrenal gland on page 797.\\nB. Hyperfunction of Posterior Pituitary and\\nHypothalamus\\nLesions of posterior pituitary and hypothalamus are\\nuncommon. Two of the syndromes associated with hyper-function of the posterior pituitary and hypothalamus are:inappropriate release of ADH and precocious puberty.\\nINAPPROPRIATE RELEASE OF ADH.  Inappropriate\\nrelease of ADH results in its excessive secretion which\\nmanifests clinically by passage of concentrated urine due toincreased reabsorption of water and loss of sodium in theurine, consequent hyponatraemia, haemodilution andexpansion of intra- and extracellular fluid volume.Inappropriate release of ADH occurs most often inparaneoplastic syndrome e.g. in oat cell carcinoma of thelung, carcinoma of the pancreas, lymphoma and thymoma.Infrequently, lesions of the hypothalamus such as trauma,haemorrhage and meningitis may produce ADHhypersecretion. Rarely, pulmonary diseases such astuberculosis, lung abscess, pneumoconiosis, empyema andpneumonia may cause overproduction of ADH.\\nPRECOCIOUS PUBERTY.  A tumour in the region of\\nhypothalamus or the pineal gland may result in premature\\nrelease of gonadotropins causing the onset of pubertalchanges prior to the age of 9 years. The features includepremature development of genitalia both in the male and inthe female, growth of pubic hair and axillary hair. In thefemale, there is breast growth and onset of menstruation.\\nHYPOPITUITARISM\\nIn hypopituitarism, there is usually deficiency of one or more\\nof the pituitary hormones affecting either anterior pituitary,or posterior pituitary and hypothalamus.\\nA. Hypofunction of Anterior Pituitary\\nAdenohypophyseal hypofunction is invariably due to\\ndestruction of the anterior lobe of more than 75% becausethe anterior pituitary possesses a large functional reserve.This may result from anterior pituitary lesions or pressureand destruction from adjacent lesions. Lesions of the anteriorpituitary include nonsecretory (chromophobe) adenoma,metastatic carcinoma, craniopharyngioma, trauma,postpartum ischaemic necrosis (Sheehan’s syndrome),empty-sella syndrome, and rarely, tuberculosis. Though anumber of syndromes associated with deficiency of anteriorpituitary hormones have been described, two importantsyndromes are panhypopituitarism and dwarfism.\\nPANHYPOPITUITARISM.  The classical clinical condition\\nof major anterior pituitary insufficiency is called\\npanhypopituitarism. Three most common causes ofpanhypopituitarism are: non-secretory (chromophobe)adenoma (discussed later), Sheehan’s syndrome andSimmond’s disease, and empty-sella syndrome.\\nSheehan’s syndrome and Simmond’s disease. Pituitary\\ninsufficiency occurring due to postpartum pituitary\\n(Sheehan’s) necrosis is called Sheehan’s syndrome, whereasoccurrence of similar process without preceding pregnancyas well as its occurrence in males is termed Simmond’sdisease. The main pathogenetic mechanism underlyingSheehan’s necrosis is the enlargement of the pituitaryoccurring during pregnancy which may be followed byhypotensive shock precipitating ischaemic necrosis of thepituitary. Other mechanisms hypothesised are: DICfollowing delivery, traumatic injury to vessels, and excessivehaemorrhage. Patients with long-standing diabetes mellitusappear to be at greater risk of developing this complication.\\nThe first clinical manifestation  of Sheehan’s syndrome is\\nfailure of lactation following delivery which is due todeficiency of prolactin. Subsequently, other symptomsdevelop which include loss of axillary and pubic hair,amenorrhoea, sterility and loss of libido. Concomitant defi-ciency of TSH and ACTH may result in hypothyroidism andadrenocortical insufficiency.\\nThe morphologic features  in the anterior pituitary in\\nSheehan’s syndrome during early stage are ischaemicnecrosis and haemorrhage, while later necrotic tissue isreplaced by fibrous tissue.\\nEmpty-sella syndrome.  Empty-sella syndrome is charac-\\nterised by the appearance of an empty sella and features ofpanhypopituitarism. Most commonly, it results fromherniation of subarachnoid space into the sella turcica due795CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine Systemto an incomplete diaphragma sella creating an empty sella.\\nOther less common causes are Sheehan’s syndrome,infarction and scarring in an adenoma, irradiation damage,or surgical removal of the gland.\\nPITUITARY DWARFISM.  Severe deficiency of GH in\\nchildren before growth is completed results in retarded\\ngrowth and pituitary dwarfism. Most commonly, isolatedGH deficiency is the result of an inherited autosomalrecessive disorder. Less often it may be due to a pituitaryadenoma or craniopharyngioma, infarction and trauma tothe pituitary. The clinical features of inherited cases ofpituitary dwarfism appear after one year of age. Theseinclude proportionate retardation in growth of bones, normalmental state for age, poorly-developed genitalia, delayedpuberty and episodes of hypoglycaemia. Pituitary dwarfmust be distinguished from hypothyroid dwarf (cretinism)in which there is achondroplasia and mental retardation(page 803).\\nB. Hypofunction of Posterior Pituitary and\\nHypothalamus\\nInsufficiency of the posterior pituitary and hypothalamus is\\nuncommon. The only significant clinical syndrome due tohypofunction of the neurohypophysis and hypothalamus isdiabetes insipidus.\\nDIABETES INSIPIDUS.  Deficient secretion of ADH causes\\ndiabetes insipidus. The causes of ADH deficiency are:\\ninflammatory and neoplastic lesions of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis, destruction of neurohypophysis due tosurgery, radiation, head injury, and lastly, are those caseswhere no definite cause is known and are labelled asidiopathic. The main features of diabetes insipidus areexcretion of a very large volume of dilute urine of low specificgravity (below 1.010), polyuria and polydipsia.\\nPITUITARY TUMOURS\\nTumours of the anterior pituitary are more common than\\nthose of the posterior pituitary and hypothalamus. The mostcommon of the anterior pituitary tumours are adenomas;primary and metastatic carcinomas being rare. Cranio-pharyngioma and granular cell tumour (choristoma) are theother benign pituitary tumours found occasionally.\\nAll pituitary tumours, whether benign or malignant,\\ncause symptoms by following 2 ways:\\n1.Pressure effects.  These are caused by expansion of the\\nlesion resulting in destruction of the surrounding glandular\\ntissue by pressure atrophy. This causes erosion andenlargement of sella turcica, upward extension of the tumourdamaging the optic chiasma, optic nerves, neurohypophysisand adjacent cranial nerves, and rarely, downward extensioninto the nasopharynx.\\n2.\\nHormonal effects.  Depending upon their cell types,\\npituitary adenomas produce excess of pituitary hormones\\nand the corresponding clinical syndromes of hyper-pituitarism. Infarction and destruction of adenoma may causesymptoms of hypopituitarism.\\nPituitary Adenomas\\nAdenomas are the most common pituitary tumours. They\\nare conventionally classified according to their H & E stainingcharacteristics of granules into acidophil, basophil andchromophobe adenomas. However, this morphologic\\nclassification  is considered quite inadequate because of the\\nsignificant functional characteristics of each type of adenomaincluding the chromophobe adenoma, which on H & Estaining does not show visible granules. As a result ofadvances in the ultrastructural and immunocytochemicalstudies, a functional classification of pituitary adenoma hasemerged. Table 27.1 presents a classification of pituitary\\nadenomas based on functional features as correlated withmorphologic features of older classification. The syndromesproduced by the tumours have been described already.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  pituitary\\nadenomas range in size from small foci of less than 10mm in size (termed microadenoma) to large adenomasseveral centimeters in diameter. They are spherical, softand encapsulated.Histologically,  by light microscopy of H & E stained\\nsections, an adenoma is composed predominantly of oneof the normal cell types of the anterior pituitary i.e.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 27.1: Morphologic and Functional Classification of Pituitary Adenomas.\\nFunctional Type Frequency Hormones Produced Clinical Syndrome\\n1.

Pleurihormonal adenoma 15% Multiple hormones Mixed796SECTION III Systemic Pathologyacidophil, basophil or chromophobe cells. These cells may\\nhave following 3 types of patterns:1.Diffuse pattern  is composed of polygonal cells arranged\\nin sheets with scanty stroma.2.Sinusoidal pattern  consists of columnar or fusiform cells\\nwith fibrovascular stroma around which the tumour cellsare arranged (Fig. 27.2) .\\n3.Papillary pattern  is composed of columnar or fusiform\\ncells arranged about fibrovascular papillae.\\nFunctionally, most common pituitary adenomas, in\\ndecreasing order of frequency, are: lactotroph (PRL-secreting)adenoma, somatotroph (GH-secreting) adenoma andcorticotroph (ACTH-secreting) adenoma. Infrequently,mixed somatotroph-lactotroph (GH-PRL-secreting)adenoma, gonadotroph (FSH-LH-secreting) adenomas andnull-cell (endocrinologically inactive) adenomas oroncocytoma are found. Pleurihormonal-pituitary adenoma,on the other hand, may have multiple hormone elaborations.Functional classification of pituitary adenoma can be doneby carrying out specific immunostains against the hormoneproducts.\\nPituitary adenoma may also occur as a part of multiple\\nendocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I) in which adenomas ofpancreatic islets, parathyroids and the pituitary are found(page 829). Clinically, the patients are characterised bycombination of features of Zollinger-Ellison’s syndrome,hyperparathyroidism and hyperpituitarism.\\nCraniopharyngioma\\nCraniopharyngioma is a benign tumour arising from\\nremnants of Rathke’s pouch. It is more common in childrenand young adults. The tumour, though benign, compressesas well as invades the adjacent structures extensively.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nencapsulated, adherent to surrounding structures and istypically cystic, reddish-grey mass.Histologically, craniopharyngioma closely resemblesameloblastoma of the jaw (page 530). There are 2 distincthistologic features:1.Stratified squamous epithelium frequently lining, a\\ncyst and containing loose stellate cells in the centre; and2. Solid ameloblastous areas.\\nGranular Cell T umour (Choristoma)\\nThough tumours of the posterior pituitary are rare, granularcell tumour or choristoma is the most common tumour ofthe neurohypophysis. It is composed of a mass of cells havinggranular eosinophilic cytoplasm similar to the cells of theposterior pituitary. It arises as a result of developmentalanomaly and hence the name choristoma. Generally, itremains asymptomatic and is discovered as an incidentalautopsy finding.\\nADRENAL GLAND\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nANATOMY.  The adrenal glands lie at the upper pole of each\\nkidney. Each gland weighs approximately 4 gm in the adult\\nbut in children the adrenals are proportionately larger. Onsectioning, the adrenal is composed of 2 distinct parts: anouter yellow-brown cortex and an inner grey medulla.  The\\nanatomic and functional integrity of adrenal cortices areessential for life, while it does not hold true for adrenal\\nmedulla.\\nHISTOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY.  Microscopically and\\nfunctionally, cortex and medulla are quite distinct.\\nADRENAL CORTEX . It is composed of 3 layers:\\n1. Zona glomerulosa  is the outer layer and comprises about\\n10% of the cortex. It consists of cords or columns of\\npolyhedral cells just under the capsule. This layer isresponsible for the synthesis of mineralocorticoids,  the most\\nimportant of which is aldosterone, the salt and waterregulating hormone.\\n2.\\nZona fasciculata  is the middle layer and constitutes\\napproximately 70% of the cortex. It is composed of columns\\nof lipid-rich cells which are precursors of various steroid\\nhormones manufactured in the adrenal cortex such as\\nglucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) and sex steroids (e.g.testosterone).\\n3. Zona reticularis  is the inner layer which makes up the\\nremainder of the adrenal cortex. It consists of cords of more\\ncompact cells than those of zona fasciculata but has similarfunctional characteristics of synthesis and secretion ofglucocorticoids  and androgens.\\nThe synthesis of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens\\nis under the control of ACTH from hypothalamus-anteriorpituitary. In turn, ACTH release is under the control of ahypothalamic releasing factor called corticotropin-releasingfactor. Release of aldosterone, on the other hand, isindependent of ACTH control and is largely regulated bythe serum levels of potassium and renin-angiotensinmechanism (page 98).Figure 27.2 Pituitary adenoma, sinusoidal pattern.\\n797CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine SystemADRENAL MEDULLA . The adrenal medulla is a component\\nof the dispersed neuroendocrine system derived from\\nprimitive neuroectoderm; the other components of thissystem being paraganglia  distributed in the vagi,\\nparavertebral and visceral autonomic ganglia. The cellscomprising this system are neuroendocrine cells, the majorfunction of which is synthesis and secretion of catecholamines(epinephrine and norepinephrine). Various other peptidessuch as calcitonin, somatostatin and vasoactive intestinalpolypeptide (VIP) are also secreted by these cells. The majormetabolites of catecholamines are metanephrine, nor-me-tanephrine, vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillicacid (HVA). In case of damage to the adrenal medulla, itsfunction is taken over by other paraganglia.\\nDiseases affecting the two parts of adrenal glands are\\nquite distinctive in view of distinct morphology, and functionof the adrenal cortex and medulla. While the disorders ofthe adrenal cortex  include adrenocortical hyperfunction\\n(hyperadrenalism), adrenocortical insufficiency (hypo-adrenalism) and adrenocortical tumours, the main lesionsaffecting the adrenal medulla  are the medullary tumours.\\nADRENOCORTICAL HYPERFUNCTION(HYPERADRENALISM)\\nHypersecretion of each of the three types of corticosteroids\\nelaborated by the adrenal cortex causes distinctcorresponding hyperadrenal clinical syndromes:1.Cushing’s syndrome  caused by excess of glucocorticoids\\n(i.e. cortisol); also called chronic hypercortisolism.\\n2.Conn’s syndrome  caused by oversecretion of mineralo-\\ncorticoids (i.e. aldosterone); also called primary hyper-\\naldosteronism.3.Adrenogenital syndrome  characterised by excessive produc-\\ntion of adrenal sex steroids (i.e. androgens); also called adrenal\\nvirilism.\\nMixed forms of these clinical syndromes may also occur.\\nCushing’s Syndrome (Chronic Hypercortisolism)\\nCushing’s syndrome is caused by excessive production of\\ncortisol of whatever cause. The full clinical expression of thesyndrome, however, includes contribution of the secondaryderangements.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  There are 4 major etiologic types\\nof Cushing’s syndrome which should be distinguished for\\neffective treatment.\\n1.Pituitary Cushing’s syndrome.  About 60-70% cases of\\nCushing’s syndrome are caused by excessive secretion of\\nACTH due to a lesion in the pituitary gland, most commonlya corticotroph adenoma or multiple corticotrophmicroadenomas. This group of cases was first described byHarvey Cushing, an American neurosurgeon, who termedthe condition as Cushing’s disease. Also included in thisgroup are cases with hypothalamic origin of excessive ACTHlevels without apparent pituitary lesion. All cases withpituitary Cushing’s syndrome are characterised by bilateraladrenal cortical hyperplasia and elevated ACTH levels. Thesecases show therapeutic response on administration of highdoses of dexamethasone which suppresses ACTH secretionand causes fall in plasma cortisol level.\\n2.Adrenal Cushing’s syndrome.  Approximately 20-25%\\ncases of Cushing’s syndrome are caused by disease in one or\\nboth the adrenal glands. These include adrenal corticaladenoma, carcinoma, and less often, cortical hyperplasia.This group of cases is characterised by low serum ACTHlevels and absence of therapeutic response to administrationof high doses of glucocorticoid.\\n3\\n. Ectopic Cushing’s syndrome.  About 10-15% cases of\\nCushing’s syndrome have an origin in ectopic ACTH elabo-\\nration by non-endocrine tumours. Most often, the tumour isan oat cell carcinoma of the lung but other lung cancers,malignant thymoma and pancreatic tumours have also beenimplicated. The plasma ACTH level is high in these casesand cortisol secretion is not suppressed by dexamethasoneadministration.\\n4. Iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome.  Prolonged therapeutic\\nadministration of high doses of glucocorticoids or ACTH may\\nresult in Cushing’s syndrome e.g. in organ transplantrecipients and in autoimmune diseases. These cases aregenerally associated with bilateral adrenocorticalinsufficiency.\\nCLINICAL  FEATURES.  Cushing’s syndrome occurs more\\noften in patients between the age of 20-40 years with three\\ntimes higher frequency in women than in men. The severityof the syndrome varies considerably, but in general thefollowing features characterise a case of Cushing’s syndrome:1.Central or truncal obesity  contrasted with relatively thin\\narms and legs, buffalo hump due to prominence of fat overthe shoulders, and rounded oedematous moon-face.2.\\nIncreased protein breakdown  resulting in wasting and\\nthinning of the skeletal muscles, atrophy of the skin andsubcutaneous tissue with formation of purple striae on theabdominal wall, osteoporosis and easy bruisability of the thinskin to minor trauma.3.Systemic hypertension  is present in 80% of cases because\\nof associated retention of sodium and water.4.Impaired glucose tolerance  and diabetes mellitus are found\\nin about 20% cases.5. Amenorrhoea, hirsutism and infertility in many women.6. Insomnia, depression, confusion and psychosis.\\nConn’s Syndrome (Primary Hyperaldosteronism)\\nThis is an uncommon syndrome occurring due to overpro-\\nduction of aldosterone, the potent  salt-retaining hormone.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The condition results primarily due\\nto adrenocortical diseases as follows:\\n1.Adrenocortical adenoma, producing aldosterone.\\n2.\\nBilateral adrenal hyperplasia, especially in children\\n(congenital hyperaldosteronism).3. Rarely, adrenal carcinoma.\\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism  from any of the above causes\\nis associated with low plasma renin levels. Secondary\\nhyperaldosteronism,  on the contrary, occurs in response to high\\nplasma renin level due to overproduction of renin by thekidneys such as in renal ischaemia, reninoma or oedema.798SECTION III Systemic PathologyCLINICAL FEATURES.  Conn’s syndrome is more frequent\\nin adult females. Its principal features are as under:\\n1.Hypertension,  usually mild to moderate diastolic\\nhypertension.2.Hypokalaemia  and associated muscular weakness,\\nperipheral neuropathy and cardiac arrhythmias.3.Retention of sodium and water.\\n4.Polyuria  and polydipsia  due to reduced concentrating\\npower of the renal tubules.\\nAdrenogenital Syndrome (Adrenal Virilism)\\nAdrenal cortex secretes a smaller amount of sex steroids than\\nthe gonads. However, adrenocortical hyperfunction mayoccasionally cause sexual disturbances.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Hypersecretion of sex steroids,\\nmainly androgens, may occur in children or in adults:\\n1.In children,  it is due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia in\\nwhich there is congenital deficiency of a specific enzyme.2.In adults,  it is caused by an adrenocortical adenoma or a\\ncarcinoma. Cushing’s syndrome is often present as well.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical features depend upon\\nthe age and sex of the patient.\\n1.In children,  there is distortion of the external genitalia in\\ngirls, and precocious puberty in boys.2.In adults,  the features in females show virilisation (e.g.\\nhirsutism, oligomenorrhoea, deepening of voice, hyper-trophy of the clitoris); and in males may rarely causefeminisation.3.There is generally increased excretion of 17-ketosteroids\\nin the urine.\\nADRENOCORTICAL INSUFFICIENCY\\n(HYPOADRENALISM)\\nAdrenocortical insufficiency may result from deficient\\nsynthesis of cortical steroids from the adrenal cortex or maybe secondary to ACTH deficiency. Three types ofadrenocortical hypofunction are distinguished:1.Primary adrenocortical insufficiency  caused primarily by the\\ndisease of the adrenal glands. Two forms are described: acuteor ‘adrenal crisis’, and chronic or ‘Addison’s disease’.2.Secondary adrenocortical insufficiency  resulting from\\ndiminished secretion of ACTH.3.Hypoaldosteronism  characterised by deficient secretion of\\naldosterone.\\nPRIMAR Y\\n ADRENOCORTICAL INSUFFICIENCY\\nPrimary adrenal hypofunction occurs due to defect in the\\nadrenal glands and normal pituitary function. It may developin 2 ways:A.Acute primary adrenocortical insufficiency or ‘adrenal\\ncrisis’.B.\\nChronic primary adrenocortical insufficiency or\\n‘Addison’s disease’.\\nA. Primary Acute Adrenocortical Insufficiency\\n(Adrenal Crisis)\\nSudden loss of adrenocortical function may result in an acute\\ncondition called adrenal crisis.ETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Causes of acute insufficiency are\\nas under:1. Bilateral adrenalectomy e.g. in the treatment of cortical\\nhyperfunction, hypertension and in selected cases of breastcancer.2. Septicaemia e.g. in endotoxic shock and meningococcal\\ninfection producing grossly haemorrhagic and necroticadrenal cortex termed adrenal apoplexy. The acute conditionso produced is called Waterhouse-Friderichsen’s syndrome.\\n3.\\nRapid withdrawal of steroids.\\n4. Any form of acute stress in a case of chronic insufficiencyi.e. in Addison’s disease.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinical features of acute adreno-\\ncortical insufficiency are due to deficiency of mineralo-\\ncorticoids and glucocorticoids. These are as follows:1.Deficiency of mineralocorticoids (i.e. aldosterone\\ndeficiency) result in salt deficiency, hyperkalaemia anddehydration.2\\n. Deficiency of glucocorticoids (i.e. cortisol deficiency)\\nleads to hypoglycaemia, increased insulin sensitivity andvomitings.\\nB. Primary Chronic Adrenocortical Insufficiency\\n(Addison’ s Disease)\\nProgressive chronic destruction of more than 90% of adrenal\\ncortex on both sides results in an uncommon clinicalcondition called Addison’s disease.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Any condition which causes\\nmarked chronic adrenal destruction may produce Addison’s\\ndisease. These include: tuberculosis, autoimmune oridiopathic adrenalitis, histoplasmosis, amyloidosis,metastatic cancer, sarcoidosis and haemochromatosis.However, currently the first two causes—tuberculosis andautoimmune chronic destruction of adrenal glands, areimplicated in majority of cases of Addison’s disease.Irrespective of the cause, the adrenal glands are bilaterallysmall and irregularly shrunken. Histologic changes,depending upon the cause, may reveal specific features asin tuberculosis and histoplasmosis, or the changes may bein the form of nonspecific lymphocytic infiltrate as inidiopathic (autoimmune) adrenalitis.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Clinical manifestations develop\\nslowly and insidiously. The usual features are as under:\\n1.Asthenia i.e. progressive weakness, weight loss and\\nlethargy as the cardinal symptoms.\\n2.\\nHyperpigmentation, initially most marked on exposed\\nareas, but later involves unexposed parts and mucous\\nmembranes as well.\\n3. Arterial hypotension.4. Vague upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as mild loss\\nof appetite, nausea, vomiting and upper abdominal pain.\\n5. Lack of androgen causing loss of hair in women.\\n6. Episodes of hypoglycaemia.7. Biochemical changes include reduced GFR, acidosis,\\nhyperkalaemia and low levels of serum sodium, chloride andbicarbonate.799CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine SystemSECONDARY ADRENOCORTICAL INSUFFICIENCY\\nAdrenocortical insufficiency resulting from deficiency of\\nACTH is called secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  ACTH deficiency may appear in\\n2 settings :\\n1.Selective ACTH deficiency  due to prolonged administration\\nof high doses of glucocorticoids. This leads to suppressionof ACTH release from the pituitary gland and selectivedeficiency.2.Panhypopituitarism  due to hypothalamus-pituitary\\ndiseases is associated with deficiency of multiple trophichormones (page 794).\\nCLINICAL  FEATURES.  The clinical features of secondary\\nadrenocortical insufficiency are like those of Addison’s\\ndisease except the following:1.These cases lack hyperpigmentation because of\\nsuppressed production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone(MSH) from the pituitary.2\\n. Plasma ACTH levels are low-to-absent in secondary\\ninsufficiency but are elevated in Addison’s disease.3. Aldosterone levels are normal due to stimulation byrenin.\\nHYPOALDOSTERONISM\\nIsolated deficiency of aldosterone with normal cortisol level\\nmay occur in association with reduced renin secretion.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The causes of such hyporeninism\\nare as follows:\\n1.Congenital defect due to deficiency of an enzyme required\\nfor its synthesis.2.\\nProlonged administration of heparin.\\n3. Certain diseases of the brain.4. Excision of an aldosterone-secreting tumour.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The patients of isolated hypo-\\naldosteronism are adults with mild renal failure and diabetes\\nmellitus. The predominant features are hyperkalaemia andmetabolic acidosis.\\nTUMOURS OF ADRENAL GLANDS\\nPrimary tumours of the adrenal glands are uncommon and\\ninclude distinct adrenocortical tumours and medullarytumours. However, adrenal gland is a more common site formetastatic carcinoma.\\nADRENOCORTICAL TUMOURS\\nCortical Adenoma\\nThe commonest cortical tumour is adenoma. They are\\nindistinguishable from hyperplastic nodules except thatlesions smaller than 2 cm diameter are labelled hyperplastic\\nnodules.  A cortical adenoma is a benign and slow-growing\\ntumour. It is usually small and nonfunctional. A few largeadenomas may, however, produce excess of cortisol,aldosterone or androgen. Association of cortical adenomaswith systemic hypertension has been suggested by someworkers. Occasionally, a cortical adenoma may be a part ofmultiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I) in whichpatients have associated adenomas of parathyroid, islet cellsand anterior pituitary (page 829).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  an adenoma is\\nusually a small, solitary, spherical and encapsulatedtumour which is well-delineated from the surroundingnormal adrenal gland. Cut section is typically brightyellow.Microscopically,  the tumour cells are arranged in\\ntrabeculae and generally resemble the cells of zonafasciculata. Less frequently, the cells of adenoma are likethose of zona glomerulosa or zona reticularis.\\nCortical Carcinoma\\nCarcinoma of the adrenal cortex is an uncommon tumour\\noccurring mostly in adults. It invades locally as well asspreads to distant sites. Most cortical carcinomas secrete oneof the adrenocortical hormones excessively.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  an adrenal\\ncarcinoma is generally large, spherical and well-demarcated tumour. On cut section, it is predominantlyyellow with intermixed areas of haemorrhages, necrosisand calcification.Microscopically,  the cortical carcinoma may vary from\\nwell-differentiated to anaplastic growth. Well-differentiated carcinoma consists of foci of atypia in anadenoma, while anaplastic carcinoma shows large,pleomorphic and bizarre cells with high mitotic activity.\\nMEDULLARY TUMOURS\\nThe most significant lesions of the adrenal medulla are\\nneoplasms. These include the following:\\nBenign tumours : These are less common and include\\npheochromocytoma and myelolipoma.\\nTumours arising from embryonic nerve cells : These are more\\ncommon and include neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma.\\nThese tumours together with extra-adrenal paragang-\\nlioma are described below.\\nPheochromocytoma (Chromaffin Tumour)\\nPheochromocytoma (meaning dusky brown tumour ) is\\ngenerally a benign tumour arising from the pheochromocytes\\n(i.e. chromaffin cells) of the adrenal medulla. The extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas arising from other paragangliaare preferably called paragangliomas, named along with the\\nanatomic site of origin, as described later.\\nPheochromocytoma may occur at any age but most\\npatients are 20-60 years old. Most pheochromocytomas areslow-growing and benign but about 5% of the tumours aremalignant, invasive and metastasising. These tumours arecommonly sporadic but 10-20% are associated with familialsyndromes of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) havingbilaterality and association with medullary carcinoma of thethyroid, hyperparathyroidism, pituitary adenoma, mucosal800SECTION III Systemic Pathologyneuromas and von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis in\\nvarying combinations.\\nThe clinical features of pheochromocytoma are\\npredominantly due to secretion of catecholamines, bothepinephrine and norepinephrine. The most common featureis hypertension. Other manifestations due to sudden releaseof catecholamines are congestive heart failure, myocardialinfarction, pulmonary oedema, cerebral haemorrhage, andeven death. The diagnosis is established by measuring 24-hour urinary catecholamines or their metabolites such asmetanephrine and VMA.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nsoft, spherical, may be quite variable in size and weight,and well-demarcated from the adjacent adrenal gland. Oncut section, the tumour is grey to dusky brown with areasof haemorrhages, necrosis, calcification and cystic change(Fig. 27.3) . On immersing the tumour in dichromate\\nfixative, it turns brown-black due to oxidation ofcatecholamines in the tumour and hence the namechromaffin tumour.Microscopically,  the tumour has the following\\ncharacteristics (Fig. 27.4) :\\n1.The tumour cells are arranged characteristically as\\nwell-defined nests (also termed as zellballen pattern)separated by abundant fibrovascular stroma. 2. Other arrangements are as solid columns, sheets,trabeculae or clumps.3\\n. The tumour cells are large, polyhedral and\\npleomorphic with abundant granular amphophilic orbasophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei.4. The tumour cells of pheochromocytoma stainpositively with neuroendocrine substances such asneuron-specific enolase (NSE) and chromogranin.About 10% of pheochromcytomas may be malignant\\nhaving tendency for osseous metastases.\\nMyelolipoma\\nMyelolipoma is an uncommon benign adrenal medullary\\ntumour found incidentally at autopsy. Less often, it mayproduce symptoms due to excessive hormone elaboration.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  a myelolipoma\\nis usually a small tumour, measuring 0.2-2 cm in diameter.Microscopically,  it consists of well-differentiated adipose\\ntissue in which is scattered clumps of haematopoietic cellsare seen.\\nNeuroblastoma\\nNeuroblastoma, also called as sympathicoblastoma, is a\\ncommon malignant tumour of embryonic nerve cells,occurring most commonly in children under 5 years of age.Vast majority of cases occur within the abdomen (in theadrenal medulla and paravertebral autonomic ganglia) andrarely in the cerebral hemisphere. Most cases are sporadicbut familial occurrence with autosomal dominant trans-mission is also seen.\\nThe clinical manifestations  of neuroblastoma are related\\nto its rapid local growth, metastatic spread or developmentof hormonal syndrome. Local symptoms include abdominaldistension, fever, weight loss and malaise. Foci of calcificationmay be observed on radiologic examination of the abdomen.Metastatic spread occurs early and widely throughhaematogenous as well as lymphatic routes and involvesbones (especially skull), liver, lungs and regional lymphnodes. Neuroblastoma produces variable amounts ofcatecholamines and its metabolites such as vanillyl mandelicacid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), which can bedetected in the 24-hour urine. Less often, the patient developscarcinoid-like syndrome, probably due to production ofkinins or prostaglandins by the tumour. The features in sucha case include watery diarrhoea, flushing of the skin and\\nFigure 27.3 Pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla. The\\nspecimen shows compressed kidney at the lower end (arrow) while the\\nupper end shows a large spherical tumour separate from the kidney. Cutsurface of tumour shows cystic change while solid areas show dark brown,necrotic and haemorrhagic tumour.\\nFigure 27.4 Adrenal pheochromocytoma. The tumour has typical\\nzellballen or nested pattern. The tumour cells are large, polyhedral andpleomorphic having abundant granular cytoplasm.801CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine Systemhypokalaemia. Rarely, the tumour may produce sufficient\\ncatecholamines to cause hypertension.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\ngenerally large, soft and lobulated mass with extensiveareas of necrosis and haemorrhages. The tumour is usuallydiffusely infiltrating into the adjacent tissues. Cut surfaceof the tumour is grey white and may reveal minute foci ofcalcification.Microscopically,  neuroblastoma has the following\\ncharacteristics (Fig. 27.5) :\\n1.The tumour cells are small, round and oval, slightly\\nlarger than lymphocytes, and have scanty and poorly-defined cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei.2. They are generally arranged in irregular sheets\\nseparated by fibrovascular stroma.3\\n. Classical neuroblastomas show Homer-Wright’s\\nrosettes (pseudorosettes) which have a central fibrillareosinophilic material surrounded by radially arrangedtumour cells. The central fibrillar material stains positivelyby silver impregnation methods indicating their natureas young nerve fibrils.4. The tumour cells stain positively with immuno-histochemical markers such as neuron-specific enolase(NSE), neurofilaments (NF) and chromogranin.\\nPrognosis of neuroblastoma depends upon a few\\nvariables:\\ni) Age of the child below 2 years is associated with better\\nprognosis.\\nii)  Extra-abdominal location  of the tumour have better outlook\\nthan abdominal masses.\\niii) Patients in clinical stage  I (confined to the organ of origin)\\nor stage II (tumour extending in continuity beyond the organ\\nof origin but not crossing the midline) have better prognosisthan higher stages with distant metastases.\\niv) Tumours with amplification of MYC  oncogene  and  p53\\nare associated with poor prognosis.Ganglioneuroma\\nA ganglioneuroma is a mature, benign and uncommon\\ntumour occurring in adults. It is derived from ganglion cells,most often in the posterior mediastinum, and uncommonlyin other peripheral ganglia and brain. The tumour producessymptoms because of its size and location. Catecholaminesand their metabolites can be detected in large amounts inthe 24-hour urine specimen of patients with ganglioneuroma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nspherical, firm and encapsulated.Microscopically,  it contains large number of well-formed\\nganglionic nerve cells scattered in fibrillar stroma andmyelinated and non-myelinated nerve fibres.\\nExtra-adrenal Paraganglioma (Chemodectoma)\\nParasympathetic paraganglia located in extra-adrenal sites\\nsuch as the carotid bodies, vagus, jugulotympanic andaorticosympathetic (pre-aortic) paraganglia may produceneoplasms, collectively termed paragangliomas  with the\\nanatomic site of origin e.g. carotid body paraganglioma,intravagal paraganglioma, jugulotympanic paragangliomaetc. These tumours are also called chemodectomas becauseof their responsiveness to chemoreceptors. They areuncommon tumours found in adults and rarely secrete excessof catecholamines, except aorticosympathetic paraganglioma(also termed extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma). Para-gangliomas are generally benign but recurrent tumours. Asmall proportion of them may metastasise widely.\\nTHYROID GLAND\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nANATOMY.  Embryologically, the thyroid gland arises\\nfrom a midline invagination at the root of the tongue and\\ngrows downwards in front of trachea and thyroid cartilageto reach its normal position. Failure to descent may produceFigure 27.5 Neuroblastoma, It shows small, round to oval cells forming irregular sheets separated by fibrovascular stroma. A few Homer-\\nWright’s pseudorosettes are also present. Inset shows a close-up view of pseudorosette.\\n802SECTION III Systemic Pathologyanomalous lingual thyroid.  The thyroglossal duct that\\nconnects the gland to the pharyngeal floor normally\\ndisappears by 6th week of embryonic life. In adults, itsproximal end is represented by foramen caecum at the baseof the tongue and distal end by the pyramidal lobe of thethyroid. Persistence of the remnants of thyroglossal duct inthe adults may develop into thyroglossal cyst (page 520). The\\nC-cells of the thyroid originate from the neuroectoderm.\\nThe thyroid gland in an adult weighs 15-40 gm and is\\ncomposed of two lateral lobes connected in the midline bya broad isthmus which may have a pyramidal lobeextending upwards. Cut section of normal thyroid isyellowish and translucent.\\nHISTOLOGY.  The thyroid is composed of lobules of colloid-\\nfilled spherical follicles or acini. The lobules are enclosed by\\nfibrovascular septa. The follicles are the main functional unitsof the thyroid. They are lined by cuboidal epithelium withnumerous fine microvilli extending into the follicular colloidthat contains the glycoprotein, thyroglobulin.  The follicles are\\nseparated from each other by delicate fibrous tissue thatcontains blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves. Calcitonin-secreting C-cells or parafollicular cells are dispersed withinthe follicles and can only be identified by silver stains andimmunohistochemical methods.\\nFUNCTIONS.  The major function of the thyroid gland is to\\nmaintain a high rate of metabolism which is done by means\\nof iodine-containing thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T\\n4) and\\ntri-iodothyronine (T3).\\nThe thyroid is one of the most labile organs in the body\\nand responds to numerous stimuli such as puberty,pregnancy, physiologic stress and various pathologic states.This functional lability of the thyroid is responsible fortransient hyperplasia of the thyroidal epithelium. Undernormal conditions, the epithelial lining of the follicles mayshow changes in various phases of function as under:\\n1. Resting phase is characterised by large follicles lined by\\nflattened cells and filled with deeply staining homogeneous\\ncolloid e.g. in colloid goitre and iodine-treated hyper-thyroidism.\\n2. Secretory phase in which the follicles are lined by\\ncuboidal epithelium and the colloid is moderately dark pink\\ne.g. in normal thyroid.\\n3. Resorptive phase  is characterised by follicles lined by\\ncolumnar epithelium and containing lightly stained\\nvacuolated and scalloped colloid e.g. in hyperthyroidism.\\nThe synthesis and release  of the two main circulating\\nthyroid hormones, T\\n3 and T4 are regulated by hypophyseal\\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and involves thefollowing steps:\\n1. Iodine trapping  by thyroidal cells involves absorbing of\\niodine from the blood and concentrating it more than twenty-\\nfold.\\n2. Oxidation of the iodide takes place within the cells by a\\nthyroid peroxidase.\\n3. Iodination  occurs next, at the microvilli level between\\nthe oxidised iodine and the tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin\\nso as to form mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) and di-iodotyrosine(DIT).4. Coupling  of MIT and DIT in the presence of thyroid\\nperoxidase forms tri-iodothyronine (T\\n3) and thyroxine (T4).\\nThe thyroid hormones so formed are released by\\nendocytosis of colloid and proteolysis of thyroglobulin withinthe follicular cells resulting in discharge of T\\n3 and T4 into\\ncirculation where they are bound to thyroxine-bindingglobulin.\\nA number of thyroid function tests  are currently available.\\nThese include the following:\\nDetermination of serum levels of T3, T4 by radio-\\nimmunoassay (RIA).\\nTSH and TRH determination.\\nDetermination of calcitonin secreted by parafollicular C\\ncells.\\nEstimation  of thyroglobulin secreted by thyroid follicular\\ncells.\\nAssessment of thyroid activity by its ability to uptake\\nradioactive iodine (RAIU).\\nAssessment whether thyroid lesion is a nonfunctioning\\n(‘cold nodule’) or hyperactive mass (‘hot nodule’).\\nDiseases of the thyroid include: functional disorders\\n(hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism), thyroiditis, Graves’disease, goitre and tumours. The relative frequency of someof these diseases varies in different geographic regionsaccording to the iodine content of the diet consumed. One ofthe important investigation tools available in current timesis the widespread use of FNAC for thyroid lesions whichhelps in avoiding a large number of unwanted diagnosticbiopsies.\\nFUNCTIONAL DISORDERS\\nTwo significant functional disorders characterised by distinct\\nclinical syndromes are described. These are: hyperthyroidism\\n(thyrotoxicosis)  and hypothyroidism.\\nHYPERTHYROIDISM (THYROTOXICOSIS)\\nHyperthyroidism, also called thyrotoxicosis, is a hyper-\\nmetabolic clinical and biochemical state caused by excessproduction of thyroid hormones. The condition is morefrequent in females and is associated with rise in both T\\n3\\nand T4 levels in blood, though the increase in T3 is generally\\ngreater than that of T4.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Hyperthyroidism may be caused\\nby many diseases but three most common causes are: Graves’disease (diffuse toxic goitre), toxic multinodular goitre anda toxic adenoma. Less frequent causes are hypersecretion ofpituitary TSH by a pituitary tumour, hypersecretion of TRH,thyroiditis, metastatic tumours of the thyroid, struma ovarii,congenital hyperthyroidism in the newborn of mother withGraves’ disease, hCG-secreting tumours due to mildthyrotropic effects of hCG (e.g. hydatidiform mole, chorio-carcinoma and testicular tumours), and lastly, by excessivedoses of thyroid hormones or iodine called jodbasedow disease.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Patients with hyperthyroidism have\\na slow and insidious onset, varying in severity from case tocase. The usual symptoms are emotional instability,803CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine Systemnervousness, palpitation, fatigue, weight loss in spite of good\\nappetite, heat intolerance, perspiration, menstrualdisturbances and fine tremors of the outstretched hands.Cardiac manifestations in the form of tachycardia,palpitations and cardiomegaly are invariably present inhyperthyroidism. The skin of these patients is warm, moistand flushed. Weakness of skeletal muscles and osteoporosisare common. Typical eye changes in the form of exoph-thalmos are a common feature in Graves’ disease. Serumlevels of T\\n3 and T4 are elevated but TSH secretion is usually\\ninhibited.\\nA sudden spurt in the severity of hyperthyroidism termed\\n‘thyroid storm’  or ‘thyroid crisis’  may occur in patients who\\nhave undergone subtotal thyroidectomy before adequatecontrol of hyperthyroid state, or in a hyperthyroid patientunder acute stress, trauma, and with severe infection. Thesepatients develop high grade fever, tachycardia, cardiacarrhythmias and coma and may die of congestive heartfailure or hyperpyrexia.\\nHYPOTHYROIDISM\\nHypothyroidism is a hypometabolic clinical state resulting\\nfrom inadequate production of thyroid hormones forprolonged periods, or rarely, from resistance of the peripheraltissues to the effects of thyroid hormones. The clinicalmanifestations of hypothyroidism, depending upon the ageat onset of disorder, are divided into 2 forms:\\n1.Cretinism  or congenital hypothyroidism  is the development\\nof severe hypothyroidism during infancy and childhood.\\n2.Myxoedema  is the adulthood hypothyroidism.\\nCretinism\\nA cretin is a child with severe hypothyroidism present at\\nbirth or developing within first two years of postnatal life.This is the period when brain development is taking place;in the absence of treatment the child is both physically andmentally retarded. The word ‘Cretin’  is derived from the\\nFrench, meaning Christ-like because these children are so\\nmentally retarded that they are incapable of committing sins.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The causes of congenital\\nhypothyroidism are as follows:1.Developmental anomalies  e.g. thyroid agenesis and ectopic\\nthyroid.\\n2.Genetic defect  in thyroid hormone synthesis e.g. defect in\\niodine trapping, oxidation, iodination, coupling and\\nthyroglobulin synthesis.3.Foetal exposure  to iodides and antithyroid drugs.\\n4.Endemic cretinism  in regions with endemic goitre due to\\ndietary lack of iodine (sporadic cretinism,  on the other hand,\\nis due to developmental anomalies and genetic defects inthyroid hormone synthesis described above).\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The clinical manifestations usually\\nbecome evident within a few weeks to months of birth. The\\npresenting features of a cretin are: slow to thrive, poorfeeding, constipation, dry scaly skin, hoarse cry and\\nbradycardia. As the child ages, clinical picture of fully-\\ndeveloped cretinism emerges characterised by impairedskeletal growth and consequent dwarfism, round face,narrow forehead, widely-set eyes, flat and broad nose, big\\nprotuberant tongue and protuberant abdomen. Neurological\\nfeatures such as deaf-mutism, spasticity and mentaldeficiency are more evident in sporadic cretinism due todevelopmental anomalies and dyshormonogenetic defects.\\nCharacteristic laboratory findings include a rise in TSH\\nlevel and fall in T\\n3 and T4 levels.\\nMyxoedema\\nThe adult-onset severe hypothyroidism causes myxoedema.\\nThe term myxoedema connotes non-pitting oedema due toaccumulation of hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides in the\\nground substance of dermis and other tissues.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  There are several causes of\\nmyxoedema listed below but the first two are the most\\ncommon causes:1.Ablation of the thyroid by surgery or radiation.\\n2. Autoimmune (lymphocytic) thyroiditis (termed primary\\nidiopathic myxoedema).\\n3.Endemic or sporadic goitre.\\n4.\\nHypothalamic-pituitary lesions.\\n5. Thyroid cancer.6. Prolonged administration of antithyroid drugs.\\n7. Mild developmental anomalies and dyshormonogenesis.\\nFigure 27.6 Appearance in functional disorders of the thyroid gland.\\n804SECTION III Systemic PathologyCLINICAL FEATURES.  The onset of myxoedema is slow\\nand a fully-developed clinical syndrome may appear after\\nseveral years of hypothyroidism. The striking features arecold intolerance, mental and physical lethargy, constipation,slowing of speech and intellectual function, puffiness of face,loss of hair and altered texture of the skin.\\nThe laboratory diagnosis in myxoedema is made by low\\nserum T\\n3 and T4 levels and markedly elevated TSH levels as\\nin the case of cretinism but cases with suprathyroid lesions(hypothalamic-pituitary disease) have low TSH levels.\\nThe clinical appearance of these three major forms of\\nfunctional disorders of the thyroid gland is shown inFig. 27.6.\\nTHYROIDITIS\\nInflammation of the thyroid, thyroiditis, is more often due\\nto non-infectious causes and is classified on the basis of onsetand duration of disease into acute, subacute and chronic asunder:\\nI.Acute thyroiditis:\\n1. Bacterial infection e.g. Staphylococcus , Streptococcus .\\n2. Fungal infection e.g. \\nAspergillus , Histoplasma , Pneumocystis.\\n3. Radiation injury\\nII. Subacute thyroiditis:\\n1. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain’sthyroiditis, giant cell thyroiditis, viral thyroiditis)2. Subacute lymphocytic (postpartum, silent) thyroiditis3. Tuberculous thyroiditis\\nIII. Chronic thyroiditis:\\n1. Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis orchronic lymphocytic thyroiditis)\\n2. Riedel’s thyroiditis (or invasive fibrous thyroiditis).\\nWhile acute infectious thyroiditis is uncommon, some of\\nthe morphologically important forms of thyroiditis from the\\nabove list are discussed below.\\nHASHIMOTO’S (AUTOIMMUNE,\\nCHRONIC L YMPHOCYTIC) THYROIDITIS\\nHashimoto’s thyroiditis, also called diffuse lymphocyticthyroiditis, struma lymphomatosa or goitrous autoimmunethyroiditis, is characterised by 3 principal features:1. Diffuse goitrous enlargement of the thyroid.2. Lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland.3. Occurrence of  thyroid autoantibodies.\\nHashimoto’s thyroiditis occurs more frequently between\\nthe age of 30 and 50 years and shows an approximately ten-fold preponderance among females. Though rare in children,about half the cases of adolescent goitre are owing toautoimmune thyroiditis. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the mostcommon cause of goitrous hypothyroidism  in regions where\\niodine supplies are adequate.  Regions where iodine intake is\\nhighest have higher incidence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis e.g.in Japan and the United States.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an\\nautoimmune disease is well established. Hashimoto, a\\nJapanese surgeon, described it in 1912 as the first auto-immune disease of any organ. Autoimmune pathogenesisof Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is explained by the followingobservations:\\n1.Other autoimmune disease association:  Like in other\\nautoimmune diseases, Hashimoto’s disease has been found\\nin association with other autoimmune diseases such asGraves’ disease, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoidarthritis, pernicious anaemia and Type 1 diabetes mellitus.\\n2. Immune destruction of thyroid cells:  The sequence of\\nimmune phenomena is initial activation of CD4+ T helper\\ncells. These cells then induce infiltration of CD8+ T cytotoxiccells in the thyroid parenchyma as well as activate B cells toform autoantibodies, which bring about immune destructionof thyroid parenchyma.\\n3.Detection of autoantibodies: The following  autoanti-\\nbodies against different thyroid cell antigens are detectable\\nin the sera of most patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis:i) Thyroid microsomal autoantibodies (against themicrosomes of the follicular cells).\\nii) Thyroglobulin autoantibodies.iii) TSH receptor autoantibodies.iv) Less constantly found are thyroid autoantibodies against\\nfollicular cell membranes, thyroid hormones themselves, andcolloid component other than thyroglobulin.\\n4. Inhibitory TSH-receptor antibodies:   TSH-receptor\\nantibody seen on the surface of thyroid cells in Hashimoto’s\\nthyroiditis is inhibitory to TSH, producing hypothyroidism.Similar antibody is observed in Graves’ disease where itcauses hyperthyroidism. It appears that TSH-receptorantibody may act both to depress or stimulate the thyroidcells to produce hypo- or hyperthyroidism respectively. Thus,these patients may have alternate episodes of hypo- orhyperthyroidism.\\n5. Genetic basis:  The disease has higher incidence in first-\\ndegree relatives of affected patients. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis\\nis seen more often with HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR5 subtypes.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Pathologically, two\\nvarieties of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are seen: classic form,\\nthe usual and more common, and fibrosing variant  found\\nin only 10% cases of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.Grossly,  the classic form  is characterised by diffuse,\\nsymmetric, firm and rubbery enlargement of the thyroidwhich may weigh 100-300 gm. Sectioned surface of thethyroid is fleshly with accentuation of normal lobulationsbut with retained normal shape of the gland. The fibrosing\\nvariant  has a firm, enlarged thyroid with compression of\\nthe surrounding tissues.Histologically,  the classic form  shows the following\\nfeatures  (Fig. 27.7) :\\n1.There is extensive infiltration of the gland by\\nlymphocytes, plasma cells, immunoblasts and macro-phages, with formation of lymphoid follicles havinggerminal centres.2.\\nThere is decreased number of thyroid follicles which\\nare generally atrophic and are often devoid of colloid.3. The follicular epithelial cells are transformed into theirdegenerated state termed Hurthle cells (also called805CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine SystemAskanazy cells, or oxyphil cells, or oncocytes). These cells\\nhave abundant oxyphilic or eosinophilic and granularcytoplasm due to large number of mitochondria andcontain large bizarre nuclei.4. There is slight fibrous thickening of the septa separatingthe thyroid lobules.\\nThe less common fibrosing variant  of Hashimoto’s\\nthyroiditis shows considerable fibrous replacement ofthyroid parenchyma and a less prominent lymphoidinfiltrate.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The presenting feature of\\nHashimoto’s thyroiditis is a painless, firm and moderategoitrous enlargement of the thyroid gland, usually associatedwith hypothyroidism, in an elderly woman. At this stage,serum T\\n3 and T4 levels are decreased and RAIU is also\\nreduced. A few cases, however, develop hyperthyroidism,termed hashitoxicosis,  further substantiating the similarities\\nin the autoimmune phenomena between Hashimoto’sthyroiditis and Graves’ thyrotoxicosis. There is no increasedrisk of developing thyroid carcinoma in Hashimoto’s thyroi-ditis but there is increased frequency of malignant lymphomain these cases.\\nSUBACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS\\nSubacute lymphocytic (or painless or silent or postpartum)\\nthyroiditis is another variety of autoimmune thyrioditis.Clinically, it differs from subacute granulomatous thyroiditisin being non-tender thyroid enlargement. It is seen more often3-6 months after delivery.\\nMicroscopically,  the features are as under:\\n1. Dense multifocal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma\\ncells in the parenchyma.2.Collapse of thyroid follicles.\\n3.\\nRarely, presence of lymphoid follicles with germinal\\ncentres, simulating Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.SUBACUTE GRANULOMATOUS (DE QUERVAIN’S)THYROIDITIS\\nGranulomatous thyroiditis, also called de Quervain’s or\\nsubacute, or giant cell thyroiditis, is a distinctive form of self-limited inflammation of the thyroid gland. Etiology of thecondition is not known but clinical features of a prodromalphase and preceding respiratory infection suggest a possibleviral etiology. The disease is more common in young andmiddle-aged women and may present clinically with painfulmoderate thyroid enlargement with fever, features of hyper-thyroidism in the early phase of the disease, andhypothyroidism if the damage to the thyroid gland is exten-sive. The condition is self-limiting and shows completerecovery of thyroid function in about 6 months.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  there is moderate\\nenlargement of the gland which is often asymmetric orfocal. The cut surface of the involved area is firm andyellowish-white.Microscopically,  the features vary according to the stage\\nof the disease:\\nInitially,  there is acute inflammatory destruction of the\\nthyroid parenchyma and formation of microabscesses.\\nLater,  the more characteristic feature of granulomatous\\nappearance is produced. These granulomas consist ofcentral colloid material surrounded by histiocytes andscattered multinucleate giant cells.\\nMore  advanced cases may show fibroblastic proli-\\nferation.\\nMorphologically similar appearance may be produced\\nin cases where vigorous thyroid palpation may initiatemechanical trauma to follicles, so-called palpation thyroiditis.\\nRIEDEL’S  THYROIDITIS\\nRiedel’s thyroiditis, also called Riedel’s struma or invasive\\nfibrous thyroiditis, is a rare chronic disease characterised byFigure 27.7 Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Histologic features include: lymphoid cell infiltration with formation of lymphoid follicles having ge rminal\\ncentres; small, atrophic and colloid-deficient follicles; presence of Hurthle cells which have granular oxyphil cytoplasm and large irregular nuclei;\\nand slight fibrous thickening of lobular septa.\\n806SECTION III Systemic Pathologystony-hard thyroid that is densely adherent to the adjacent\\nstructures in the neck. The condition is clinically significantdue to compressive clinical features (e.g. dysphagia,dyspnoea, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and stridor)and resemblance with thyroid cancer. Riedel’s struma is seenmore commonly in females in 4th to 7th decades of life. Theetiology is unknown but possibly Riedel’s thyroiditis is a partof multifocal idiopathic fibrosclerosis  (page 591). This group of\\ndisorders includes: idiopathic retroperitoneal, mediastinaland retro-orbital fibrosis, and sclerosing cholangitis, all ofwhich may occur simultaneously with Riedel’s thyroiditis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the thyroid gland\\nis usually contracted, stony-hard, asymmetric and firmlyadherent to the adjacent structures. Cut section is hardand devoid of lobulations.Microscopically,  there is extensive fibrocollagenous\\nreplacement, marked atrophy of the thyroid parenchyma,focally scattered lymphocytic infiltration and invasion ofthe adjacent muscle tissue by the process.\\nGRAVES’ DISEASE (DIFFUSE TOXIC GOITRE)\\nGraves’ disease, also known as Basedow’s disease, primary\\nhyperplasia, exophthalmic goitre, and diffuse toxic goitre, ischaracterised by a triad of features:\\nHyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis)\\nDiffuse thyroid enlargement\\nOphthalmopathy.\\nThe disease is more frequent between the age of 30 and\\n40 years and has five-fold increased prevalence among\\nfemales.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Graves’ disease is an autoimmune\\ndisease and, as already stated, there are many immunologic\\nsimilarities between this condition and Hashimoto’sthyroiditis. These are as follows:\\n1. Genetic factor association.  Like in Hashimoto’s\\nthyroiditis. Graves’disease too has genetic predisposition. A\\nfamilial occurrence has been observed. Susceptibility todevelop Graves’ disease has been found associated withHLA-DR3 (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis has both HLA-DR3 andHLA-DR5 association, page 804), CTLA-4  and PTPN22\\n(a T-cell regulatory gene).\\n2.Autoimmune disease association.  Graves’ disease may\\nbe found in association with other organ-specific auto-\\nimmune diseases. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’disease are frequently present in the same families and thetwo diseases may coexist in the same patient.\\n3.\\nOther factors.  Besides these two factors, Graves’ disease\\nhas higher prevalence in women (7 to 10 times), and\\nassociation with emotional stress and smoking.\\n4.Autoantibodies. Autoantibodies against thyroid antigens\\nare detectable in the serum of these patients too but their\\nsites of action are different from that of Hashimoto’sthyroiditis. In Graves’ disease, TSH-receptor autoantigen isthe main antigen against which autoantibodies  are directed.\\nThese are as under:i)Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI): It binds to TSH\\nreceptor and stimulates increased release of thyroid hormone.\\nii)Thyroid growth-stimulating immunoglobulins (TGI) : It\\nstimulates proliferation of follicular epithelium.\\niii)TSH-binding inhibitor immunoglobulins (TBII) : It is\\ninhibitory to binding of TSH to its own receptor. Depending\\nupon its action as inhibitory or stimulatory to follicularepithelium, it may result in alternate episodes of hypo- andhyperthyroidism.\\nHowever, it is not quite clear what stimulates B cells to\\nform these autoantibodies in Graves’ disease. Possibly,intrathyroidal CD4+ helper T cells are responsible forstimulating B cells to secrete autoantibodies.\\nThe pathogenesis of Graves’ infiltrative ophthalmopathy\\nis also of autoimmune origin. The evidence in support is theintense lymphocytic infiltrate around the ocular muscles anddetection of circulating autoantibodies against muscleantigen that cross-react with thyroid microsomes.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the thyroid is\\nmoderately, diffusely and symmetrically enlarged andmay weigh up to 70-90 gm. On cut section, the thyroidparenchyma is typically homogeneous, red-brown andmeaty and lacks the normal translucency.Histologically,  the following features are found  (Fig. 27.8) :\\n1. There is considerable epithelial hyperplasia and\\nhypertrophy as seen by increased height of the follicularlining cells and formation of papillary infoldings of piledup epithelium into the lumina of follicles which are small.2.\\nThe colloid is markedly diminished and is lightly\\nstaining, watery and finely vacuolated.3. The stroma shows increased vascularity andaccumulation of lymphoid cells.\\nHowever, the pathologic changes in gross specimen as\\nwell as on histologic examination are considerably altered ifpreoperative medication has been administered. Iodine\\nFigure 27.8 Graves’ disease. The follicles are small and are lined\\nby tall columnar epithelium, which is piled up at places forming papillary\\ninfoldings. Colloid is nearly absent and appears lightly staining, wateryand finely vacuolated.\\n807CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine Systemadministration results in accumulation of colloid in the\\nfollicles and decrease in vascularity and height of follicularcells, while antithyroid drugs such as thiouracil cause markedhyperplasia.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  Graves’ disease generally develops\\nslowly and insidiously.\\nPatients are usually young women who present with\\nsymmetric, moderate enlargement of the thyroid gland with\\nfeatures of thyrotoxicosis (page 802), ophthalmopathy anddermatopathy.\\nOcular abnormalities  are lid lag, upper lid retraction, stare,\\nweakness of eye muscles and proptosis. In extreme cases,the lids can no longer close and may produce corneal injuriesand ulcerations.\\nDermatopathy  in Graves’ disease most often consists of\\npretibial (localised) myxoedema in the form of firm plaques.\\nLike in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, there is no increased risk\\nof development of thyroid cancer in Graves’ disease.\\nGOITRE\\nThe term goitre is defined as thyroid enlargement caused by\\ncompensatory hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the follicularepithelium in response to thyroid hormone deficiency. Theend-result of this hyperplasia is generally a euthyroid state\\n(in contrast to thyrotoxicosis occurring in diffuse toxic goitreor Graves’ disease) though at some stages there may be hypo-or hyperthyroidism. Two morphologic forms of goitre aredistinguished:A.Diffuse goitre (simple nontoxic goitre or colloid goitre).\\nB. Nodular goitre (multinodular goitre or adenomatous\\ngoitre).\\nPathogenesis of Goitre\\nThe pathogenetic mechanisms of both forms of goitre can be\\nconsidered together since nodular goitre is generallyregarded as the end-stage of long-standing simple goitre(Fig. 27.9) . The fundamental defect is deficient production\\nof thyroid hormones due to various etiologic factorsdescribed below, but most common is dietary lack of iodine.\\nDeficient thyroid hormone production causes excessive TSHstimulation which leads to hyperplasia of follicularepithelium as well as formation of new thyroid follicles.Cyclical hyperplastic stage followed by involution stagecompletes the picture of simple goitre.  Repeated and\\nprolonged changes of hyperplasia result in continued growthof thyroid tissue while involuted areas undergo fibrosis, thuscompleting the picture of nodular goitre.\\nDiffuse Goitre(Simple Non-toxic Goitre, Colloid Goitre)\\nDiffuse, nontoxic simple or colloid goitre is the name given\\nto diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, unaccompaniedby hyperthyroidism. Most cases are in a state of euthyroidthough they may have passed through preceding stage ofhypothyroidism due to inadequate supply of iodine. TSHlevels are invariably elevated. In general, goitre is morecommon in females. Simple goitre often appears at pubertyor in adolescence, following which it may either regress ormay progress to nodular goitre.\\nETIOLOGY.  Epidemiologically, goitre occurs in 2 forms:\\nendemic, and non-endemic or sporadic.\\nEndemic goitre.  Prevalence of goitre in a geographic area in\\nmore than 10% of the population is termed endemic goitre.\\nSuch endemic areas are several high mountainous regionsfar from the sea where iodine content of drinking water andfood is low such as in the regions of the Himalayas, the Alpsand the Ande. Of late, however, the prevalence in these areashas declined due to prophylactic use of iodised salt.\\nThough most endemic goitres are caused by dietary lack\\nof iodine, some cases occur due to goitrogens and geneticfactors. Goitrogens  are substances which interfere with the\\nsynthesis of thyroid hormones. These substances are drugsused in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and certain itemsof food such as cabbage, cauliflower, turnips and cassavaroots.\\nSporadic (non-endemic) goitre.  Non-endemic or sporadic\\nsimple goitre is less common than the endemic variety. In\\nmost cases, the etiology of sporadic goitre is unknown. Anumber of causal influences have been attributed. Theseinclude the following:\\nSuboptimal iodine intake in conditions of increased\\ndemand as in puberty and pregnancy.Figure 27.9 Pathogenesis of simple and nodular goitre.\\n808SECTION III Systemic PathologyGenetic factors.\\nDietary goitrogenes.\\nHereditary defect in thyroid hormone synthesis and\\ntransport (dyshormonogenesis).\\nInborn errors of iodine metabolism.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the enlargement\\nof the thyroid gland in simple goitre is moderate (weighing\\nup to 100-150 gm), symmetric and diffuse. Cut surface isgelatinous and translucent brown  (Fig. 27.10) .\\nHistologically,  two stages are distinguished:\\n1.Hyperplastic stage  is the early stage and is characterised\\nby tall columnar follicular epithelium showing papillaryinfoldings and formation of small new follicles.2.Involution stage  generally follows hyperplastic stage\\nafter variable period of time. This stage is characterisedby large follicles distended by colloid and lined byflattened follicular epithelium  (Fig. 27.11) .Nodular Goitre(Multinodular Goitre, Adenomatous Goitre)\\nAs already stated, nodular goitre is regarded as the end-stageof long-standing simple goitre. It is characterised by mostextreme degree of tumour-like enlargement of the thyroidgland and characteristic nodularity. The enlargement of thegland may be sufficient to not only cause cosmeticdisfigurement, but in many cases may cause dsyphagia andchoking due to compression of oesophagus and trachea. Mostcases are in a euthyroid state but about 10% cases maydevelop thyrotoxicosis resulting in toxic nodular goitre orPlummer’s disease. However, thyrotoxicosis of Plummer’s\\ndisease  (toxic nodular goitre) differs from that of Graves’\\ndisease (diffuse toxic goitre) in lacking features of ophthalmo-pathy and dermatopathy. Such ‘hot nodules’ may be pickedup by CT scan or by RAIU studies. Since nodular goitre isderived from simple goitre, it has the same femaleFigure 27.10 Simple (diffuse nontoxic or colloid) goitre.  The thyroid\\ngland is enlarged diffusely. Cut section shows lobules of translucent\\ngelatinous light brown parenchyma and areas of haemorrhage.\\nFigure 27.11 Simple goitre. Microscopy shows large follicles distended by colloid and lined by flattened follicular epithelium.\\n809CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine Systempreponderance but affects older individuals because it is a\\nlate complication of simple goitre.\\nETIOLOGY.  Etiologic factors implicated in endemic and non-\\nendemic or sporadic variety of simple goitre are involved in\\nthe etiology of nodular goitre too. However, how nodularpattern is produced is not clearly understood. Possibly,epithelial hyperplasia, generation of new follicles, andirregular accumulation of colloid in the follicles—allcontribute to produce increased tension and stress in thethyroid gland causing rupture of follicles and vessels. Thisis followed by haemorrhages, scarring and sometimescalcification, resulting in development of nodular pattern.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the thyroid in\\nnodular goitre shows asymmetric and extremeenlargement, weighing 100-500 gm or even more. The five\\ncardinal macroscopic features are as under  (Fig. 27.12):\\n1. Nodularity with poor encapsulation2.Fibrous scarring\\n3. Haemorrhages\\n4. Focal calcification5. Cystic degeneration.\\nCut surface generally shows multinodularity but\\noccasionally there may be only one or two nodules whichare poorly-circumscribed (unlike complete encapsulationof thyroid adenoma, described below).Histologically,  the same heterogenicity as seen on gross\\nappearance is seen. Corresponding microscopic featuresare as follows (Fig. 27.13) :\\n1.Partial or incomplete encapsulation of nodules.\\n2.The follicles varying from small to large and lined by\\nflat to high epithelium. A few may show macropapillaryformation.3.\\nAreas of haemorrhages, haemosiderin-laden macro-\\nphages and cholesterol crystals.4. Fibrous scarring with foci  of calcification.\\n5.\\nMicro-macrocystic change.Figure 27.12 Nodular goitre. The thyroid gland is enlarged and\\nnodular. Cut surface shows multiple nodules separated from each other\\nby incomplete fibrous septa. Areas of haemorrhage and cystic change\\nare also seen.\\nFigure 27.13 Nodular goitre. The predominant histologic features are: nodularity, extensive scarring with foci of calcification, areas of\\nhaemorrhages and variable-sized follicles lined by flat to high epithelium and containing abundant colloid.\\n810SECTION III Systemic PathologyThe contrasting features of diffuse and nodular goitre\\nare summarised in Table 27.2.\\nTHYROID TUMOURS\\nMost primary tumours of the thyroid are of follicular\\nepithelial origin; a few arise from parafollicular C-cells. Themost common benign thyroid neoplasm is a follicularadenoma. Malignant tumours of the thyroid are less commonbut thyroid carcinoma is the most common type, thoughrarely lymphomas and sarcomas also occur.\\nFOLLICULAR ADENOMA\\nFollicular adenoma is the most common benign thyroid\\ntumour occurring more frequently in adult women.Clinically, it appears as a solitary nodule which can be foundin approximately 1% of the population. Besides the follicularadenoma, other conditions which may produce clinicallyapparent solitary nodule in the thyroid are a dominantnodule of nodular goitre and thyroid carcinoma. It is thusimportant to distinguish adenomas from these twoconditions. Though most adenomas cause no clinical problemand behave as a ‘cold nodule’, rarely they may produce mildhyperthyroidism and appear as ‘hot nodule’ on RAIUstudies. Adenoma, however, rarely ever becomes malignant.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the follicular\\nadenoma is characterised by four features so as to\\ndistinguish it from a nodule of nodular goitre (Fig. 27.14) :\\n1.solitary nodule;\\n2. complete encapsulation;3.\\nclearly distinct architecture inside and outside the\\ncapsule; and4. compression of the thyroid parenchyma outside thecapsule\\nUsually, an adenoma is small (up to 3 cm in diameter)\\nand spherical. On cut section, the adenoma is grey-whiteto red-brown, less colloidal than the surrounding thyroidparenchyma and may have degenerative changes such asfibrous scarring, focal calcification, haemorrhages and cystformation.Histologically,  the tumour shows complete fibrous\\nencapsulation. The tumour cells are benign follicularepithelial cells forming follicles of various sizes or mayshow trabecular, solid and cord patterns with little follicleformation. Accordingly, the following 6 types of growthpatterns are distinguished, though more than one patternmay be present in a single tumour:1.Microfollicular (foetal) adenoma  consists of small follicles\\ncontaining little or no colloid and separated by abundantloose stroma (Fig. 27.15) .\\n2.Normofollicular (simple) adenoma  has closely packed\\nfollicles like that of normal thyroid gland.3.Macrofollicular (colloid) adenoma  contains large follicles\\nof varying size and distended with colloid.4.Trabecular (embryonal) adenoma  resembles embryonal\\nthyroid and consists of closely packed solid or trabecularpattern of epithelial cells with an occasional small abortivefollicle.5.Hurthle cell (oxyphilic) adenoma is an uncommon variant\\ncomposed of solid trabeculae of large cells havingabundant granular oxyphilic cytoplasm and vesicular\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 27.2: Contrasting Features of Simple and  Nodular Goitre.\\nFeature Diffuse  Goitre Nodular Goitre\\n1.

The tumour cells do not form follicles and contain\\nlittle stroma.6.Atypical adenoma  is the term used for a follicular\\nadenoma which has more pronounced cellular prolife-ration so that features may be considered indicative ofmalignancy such as pleomorphism, increased mitoses andnuclear atypia. These tumours, however, do not showcapsular and vascular invasion—features whichdistinguish it from follicular carcinoma.\\nTHYROID CANCER\\nApproximately 95% of all primary thyroid cancers are\\ncarcinomas. Primary lymphomas of the thyroid comprise lessthan 5% of thyroid cancers and majority of them possiblyevolve from autoimmune (lymphocytic) thyroiditis (page\\n804). Sarcomas of the thyroid are extremely rare. About 20%\\nof patients dying of metastasising malignancy havemetastatic deposits in the thyroid gland, most commonly\\nfrom malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and\\nbronchogenic carcinoma.\\nIn line with most other thyroid lesions, most carcinomas\\nof the thyroid too have female preponderance and are twicemore common in women.\\nCarcinoma of the thyroid gland has 4 major morphologic\\ntypes with distinctly different clinical behaviour and variableprevalence. These are: papillary, follicular, medullary andundifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinoma; their contrasting\\nfeatures are summed up in Table 27.3.Figure 27.15 Follicular adenoma, foetal (microfollicular) type. The tumour is well-encapsulated with compression of surrounding thyroid\\nparenchyma.

Most important risk factor\\nimplicated in the etiology of thyroid cancer is external\\nradiation, and to a some extent there is role of TSH receptorsand iodine excess, while pathogenesis of thyroid cancer isexplained on genetic alterations.\\n1. External radiation.  The single most important\\nenvironmental factor associated with increased risk of\\ndeveloping thyroid carcinoma after many years of exposureto external radiation of high dose. Evidences in supportinclude: high incidence of thyroid cancer in individualsirradiated in early age for enlarged thymus and for skindisorders, in Japanese atomic bomb survivors, and inindividuals living in the vicinity of nuclear accident sites. Inparticular, exposure to radiation to children and young adultshas been found to be associated with higher incidence ofdevelopment of papillary carcinoma later.\\n2.Iodine excess and TSH.  In regions where endemic goitre\\nis widespread, addition of iodine to diet has resulted in\\nincrease in incidence of papillary cancer. Many well-differentiated thyroid cancers express TSH receptors and thusrespond to T\\n4 suppression of TSH.\\n3. Genetic basis. Familial clustering of thyroid cancer has\\nbeen observed, especially in medullary carcinoma. Molecularstudies reveal that thyroid carcinoma is a multistep processinvolving genetic alterations but distinct mutations are seenin different histologic types:i) Papillary thyroid carcinoma :  Mutation in  RET gene (gene\\noverexpression) located  on chromosome 10q is seen in about\\n20% cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma. This mutationrenders the tyrosine kinase receptor under the target of othertumour-promoting factors such as radiation exposure inpapillary carcinoma. Another genetic abnormality seen in5-10% cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma is generearrangement in NTRK1  (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase\\nreceptor 1 located on chromosome 1q) gene.ii) Follicular thyroid carcinoma : About 50% cases of follicular\\nthyroid carcinoma have mutation in  RAS family of oncogenes\\nthat includes HRAS , NRAS  and KRAS.  Besides, fusion-translocation between 2 genes— PAX-8  (paired domain\\ntranscription factor) and PPAR\\nγ-1 (gene coding for\\nperoxisome proliferator- activator receptor γ-1), has also been\\ndescribed in a proportion of cases of follicular thyroid\\nneoplasms, both adenoma and carcinoma.iii) Medullary thyroid carcinoma:  Medullary thyroid carcinoma\\narises from parafollicular C-cells in the thyroid. Pointmutation in RET -protooncogene  is seen in both familial as a\\nwell as sporadiac cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma.iv) Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma:  This tumour either arises from\\nfurther dedifferentiation of differentiated papillary orfollicular thyroid carcinoma, or by inactivating point\\nmutation in p53 tumour suppressor gene or by mutation in\\ngene coding for β-catenin pathway.\\nPapillary Thyroid Carcinoma\\nPapillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid\\ncarcinoma, comprising 75-85% of cases. It can occur at all\\nages including children and young adults but the incidence\\nis higher with advancing age. The tumour is found aboutthree times more frequently in females than in males.\\nPapillary carcinoma is typically a slow-growing\\nmalignant tumour, most often presenting as an asymptomaticsolitary nodule. Involvement of the regional lymph nodes is\\ncommon but distant metastases to organs are rare. Some cases\\nfirst come to attention by spread to regional lymph nodesand cause cervical lymphadenopathy. ‘Lateral aberrant thyroid’\\nis the term used for occurrence of thyroid tissue in the lateralcervical lymph node, which in most patients represents awell-differentiated metastasis of an occult papillary\\ncarcinoma of the thyroid.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  papillary carci-\\nnoma may range from microscopic foci to nodules upto10 cm in diameter and is generally poorly delineated. Cutsurface of the tumour is greyish-white, hard and scar-like(Fig. 27.16).  Sometimes the tumour is transformed into a\\ncyst, into which numerous papillae project and is termedpapillary cystadenocarcinoma.\\nFigure 27.16 Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Cut surface of the\\nenlarged thyroid gland shows a single nodule separated from the rest of\\nthyroid parenchyma by incomplete fibrous septa (arrow). The nodule is\\ngrey-white soft and shows grossly visible papillary pattern.\\n813CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine SystemHistologically,  the following features are present\\n(Fig. 27.17):\\n1. Papillary pattern.  Papillae composed of fibrovascular\\nstalk and covered by single layer of tumour cells is thepredominant feature. Papillae are often accompanied byfollicles.2.Tumour cells.  The tumour cells have characteristic\\nnuclear features due to dispersed nuclear chromatin\\nimparting it  ground glass or optically clear appearance  and\\nclear or oxyphilic cytoplasm. These tumour cells, besides\\ncovering the papillae, may form follicles and solid sheets.3. Invasion.  The tumour cells invade the capsule and\\nintrathyroid lymphatics but invasion of blood vessels israre.4.\\nPsammoma bodies.  Half of papillary carcinomas show\\ntypical small, concentric, calcified spherules calledpsammoma bodies in the stroma.\\nThe prognosis of papillary carcinoma is good: 10-year\\nsurvival rate is 80-95%, irrespective of whether the tumouris pure papillary or mixed papillary-follicular carcinoma.\\nFollicular Thyroid Carcinoma\\nFollicular carcinoma is the other common type of thyroid\\ncancer, next only to papillary carcinoma and comprises about10-20% of all thyroid carcinomas. It is more common inmiddle and old age and has preponderance in females(female-male ratio 2.5:1). In contrast to papillary carcinoma,follicular carcinoma has a positive correlation with endemicgoitre but the role of external radiation in its etiology isunclear.\\nFollicular carcinoma presents clinically either as a solitary\\nnodule or as an irregular, firm and nodular thyroidenlargement. The tumour is slow-growing but more rapidthan the papillary carcinoma. In contrast to papillarycarcinoma, regional lymph node metastases are rare butdistant metastases by haematogenous route are common,especially to the lungs and bones.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  follicular carci-\\nnoma may be either in the form of a solitary adenoma-like circumscribed nodule or as an obvious cancerousirregular thyroid enlargement. The cut surface of thetumour is grey-white with areas of haemorrhages, necrosisand cyst formation and may extend to involve adjacentstructures.Microscopically,  the features are as under  (Fig. 27.18):\\n1. Follicular pattern:  Follicular carcinoma, like follicular\\nadenoma, is composed of follicles of various sizes and mayshow trabecular or solid pattern. The tumour cells havehyperchromatic nuclei and the cytoplasm resembles thatof normal follicular cells. However, variants like clear cell\\ntype and Hurthle cell (oxyphilic) type  of follicular carcinoma\\nmay occur. The tumour differs from papillary carcinomain lacking: papillae, ground-glass nuclei of tumour cellsand psammoma bodies.2. Vascular invasion and direct extension:  Vascular\\ninvasion and direct extension to involve the adjacentstructures (e.g. into the capsule) are significant featuresbut lymphatic invasion is rare.\\nThe prognosis of follicular carcinoma is between that of\\npapillary and undifferentiated carcinoma: 10-year survivalrate is 50-70%.\\nMedullary Thyroid Carcinoma\\nMedullary carcinoma is a less frequent type derived from\\nparafollicular or C-cells present in the thyroid and comprisesabout 5% of thyroid carcinomas. It is equally common in menand women. There are 3 distinctive features whichdistinguish medullary carcinoma from the other thyroidcarcinomas. These are: its familial occurrence, secretion ofcalcitonin and other peptides, and amyloid stroma.\\n1. Familial occurrence.  Most cases of medullary carcinoma\\noccur sporadically, but about 10% have a genetic background\\nwith point mutation in RET -protooncogene located on\\nchromosome 10q. The familial form of medullary carcinomaFigure 27.17 Papillary carcinoma thyroid. Microscopy shows branching papillae having flbrovascular stalk covered by a single layer of cuboidal\\ncells having ground-glass nuclei. Colloid-filled follicles and solid sheets of tumour cells are also present.\\n814SECTION III Systemic Pathologyhas association with pheochromocytoma and parathyroid\\nadenoma (multiple endocrine neoplasia, MEN II A), or withpheochromocytoma and multiple mucosal neuromas (MENII B). The sporadic cases occur in the middle and old age(5th-6th decades) and are generally unilateral, while thefamilial cases are found at younger age (2nd-3rd decades)and are usually bilateral and multicentric.\\n2. Secretion of calcitonin and other peptides.  Like normal\\nC-cells, tumour cells of medullary carcinoma secrete\\ncalcitonin, the hypocalcaemic hormone. In addition, thetumour may also elaborate prostaglandins, histaminase,somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and ACTH.These hormone elaborations are responsible for a number ofclinical syndromes such as carcinoid syndrome, Cushing’ssyndrome and diarrhoea.\\n3. Amyloid stroma.  Most medullary carcinomas have\\namyloid deposits in the stroma which stains positively with\\nusual amyloid stains such as Congo red. The amyloiddeposits are believed to represent stored calcitonin derivedfrom neoplastic C-cells in the form of prohormone.\\nMost cases of medullary carcinoma present as solitary\\nthyroid nodule but sometimes an enlarged cervical lymphnode may be the first manifestation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour may\\neither appear as a unilateral solitary nodule (sporadic form),\\nor have bilateral and multicentric involvement (familial\\nform).  However, sporadic neoplasms also eventually\\nspread to the contralateral lobe. Cut surface of tumour inboth forms shows well-defined tumour areas which arefirm to hard, grey-white to yellow-brown with areas ofhaemorrhages and necrosis.Histologically,  the features are as under  (Fig. 27.19) :\\n1. Tumour cells:  Like other neuroendocrine tumours (e.g.\\ncarcinoid, islet cell tumour, paraganglioma etc), medullarycarcinoma of the thyroid too has a well-defined organoidpattern, forming nests of tumour cells separated byfibrovascular septa. Sometimes, the tumour cells may bearranged in sheets, ribbons pseudopapillae or smallfollicles. The tumour cells are uniform and have thestructural and functional characteristics of C-cells. Lessoften, the neoplastic cells are spindle-shaped.2. Amyloid stroma:  The tumour cells are separated by\\namyloid stroma derived from altered calcitonin which canbe demonstrated by immunostain for calcitonin. The\\nstaining properties of amyloid are similar to that seen in\\nsystemic amyloidosis and may have areas of irregularcalcification but without regular laminations seen inpsammoma bodies. 3. C-cell hyperplasia:  Familial cases generally have\\nC-cell hyperplasia as a precursor lesion but not in sporadiccases.\\nMost medullary carcinomas are slow-growing. Regional\\nlymph node metastases may occur but distant organmetastases are infrequent. The prognosis is better in familialform than in the sporadic form: overall 10-year survival rateis 60-70%.\\nAnaplastic Carcinoma\\nUndifferentiated or anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid\\ncomprises less than 5% of all thyroid cancers and is one ofthe most malignant tumour in humans. The tumour ispredominantly found in old age (7th-8th decades) and isslightly more common in females than in males (female-maleratio 1.5:1). The tumour is widely aggressive and rapidlygrowing. The features at presentation are usually those ofextensive invasion of adjacent soft tissue, trachea andoesophagus. These features include: dyspnoea, dysphagiaand hoarseness, in association with rapidly-growing tumourin the neck. The tumour metastasises both to regional lymphnodes and to distant organs such as the lungs.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\ngenerally large and irregular, often invading the adjacentFigure 27.18 Follicular carcinoma, showing encapsulated tumour with invasion of a capsular vessel. The follicles lined by tumour cells are o f\\nvarious sizes and there is mild pleomorphism.\\n815CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine System\\nbizarre and lobed nuclei and some assuming spindle\\nshapes.\\nThe prognosis is poor: 5-year survival rate is less than\\n10% and median survival after the diagnosis is about2 months.\\nPARATHYROID GLANDS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nANATOMY.  The parathyroid glands are usually 4 in\\nnumber: the superior pair  derived from the 3rd branchial\\npouch and inferior pair from the 4th branchial pouch of\\nprimitive foregut. Both pairs are usually embedded in the\\nposterior aspect of the thyroid substance but separated fromit by a connective tissue capsule. In the adults, each gland isan oval, yellowish-brown, flattened body, weighing 35-45mg. There may, however, be variation in the number, locationand size of parathyroid glands.\\nHISTOLOGY AND FUNCTIONS. Microscopically,\\nparathyroid glands are composed of solid sheets and cordsFigure 27.19 Medullary carcinoma thyroid. Microscopy shows\\norganoid pattern of oval tumour cells and abundant amyloid stroma.\\nAmyloid shows congophilia which depicts apple-green birefringence under\\npolarising microscopy.\\nstrap muscles of the neck and other structures in the\\nvicinity of the thyroid. Cut surface of the tumour is whiteand firm with areas of necrosis and haemorrhages.Histologically,  the tumour is too poorly-differentiated to\\nbe placed in any other histologic type of thyroid cancer,but usually shows a component of either papillary orfollicular carcinoma in better differentiated areas. Thetumour is generally composed of 3 types of cells occurringin varying proportions: small cells, spindle cells and giantcells. When one of these cell types is predominant, thehistologic variant of undifferentiated carcinoma is namedaccordingly. Thus, there are 3 histologic variants:1. Small cell carcinoma:  This type of tumour is\\ncomposed of closely packed small cells having hyper-chromatic nuclei and numerous mitoses. This variantclosely resembles malignant lymphoma.2. Spindle cell carcinoma:  These tumours are composed\\nof spindle cells resembling sarcoma. Some tumours maycontain obvious sarcomatous component such as areas ofosteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma.3. Giant cell carcinoma:  This type is composed of highly\\nanaplastic giant cells showing numerous atypical mitoses,\\n816SECTION III Systemic Pathologyof parenchymal cells and variable amount of stromal fat. The\\nparenchymal cells are of 3 types: chief cells, oxyphil cells and\\nwater-clear cells.  The chief cells are most numerous and are\\nthe major source of parathyroid hormone. The latter twotypes of cells appear to be derived from the chief cells andhave sparse secretory granules but are potentially capableof secreting parathyroid hormone.\\nThe major function  of the parathyroid hormone, in\\nconjunction with calcitonin and vitamin D, is to regulateserum calcium levels and metabolism of bone. Parathyroidhormone tends to elevate serum calcium level and reduceserum phosphate level. Secretion of parathyroid hormonetakes place in response to serum levels of calcium by afeedback mechanism—lowered serum calcium stimulatessecretion of parathyroid hormone, while elevated serumcalcium causes decreased secretion of the hormone. The roleof parathyroid hormone in regulating calcium metabolismin the body is at the following 3 levels (Fig. 27.20):\\n1. Parathyroid hormone stimulates osteoclastic activity  and\\nresults in resorption of bone and release of calcium. Calci-tonin released by C-cells, on the other hand, opposesparathyroid hormone by preventing resorption of bone andlowering serum calcium level.\\n2.Parathyroid hormone acts directly on renal tubular epithe-\\nlial cells and increases renal reabsorption of calcium and\\ninhibits reabsorption of phosphate; calcitonin enhances renal\\nexcretion of phosphate.\\n3. Parathyroid hormone increases renal production of t\\nhe\\nmost active metabolite of vitamin D,  i.e. 1, 25-dihydrocholecalci-\\nferol, which in turn increases calcium absorption from the\\nsmall intestine.\\nThe major parathyroid disorders are its functional\\ndisorders (hyper- and hypoparathyroidism) and neoplasms.HYPERPARATHYROIDISM\\nHyperfunction of the parathyroid glands occurs due to\\nexcessive production of parathyroid hormone. It is classifiedinto 3 types—primary, secondary and tertiary.\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism  occurs from oversecretion of\\nparathyroid hormone due to disease of the parathyroidglands.\\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism  is caused by diseases in\\nother parts of the body.\\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism  develops from secondary\\nhyperplasia after removal of the cause of secondaryhyperplasia.\\nPrimary Hyperparathyroidism\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is not uncommon and occurs\\nmore commonly with increasing age. It is especially likelyto occur in women near the time of menopause.\\nETIOLOGY.  Common causes of primary hyperpara-\\nthyroidism are as follows:\\n1. Most commonly, parathyroid adenomas in approxi-mately 80% cases.2. Carcinoma of the parathyroid glands in 2-3% patients.\\n3.\\nPrimary hyperplasia in about 15% cases (usually chief\\ncell hyperplasia).\\nAlso included above are the familial cases of multiple\\nendocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes where parathyroidadenoma or primary hyperplasia is one of the components.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The patients with primary hyper-\\nparathyroidism have the following characteristic biochemical\\nabnormalities:1.Elevated levels of parathyroid hormone\\n2. Hypercalcaemia3.Hypophosphataemia\\n4.\\nHypercalciuria\\nClinical presentation of individuals with primary hyper-\\nparathyroidism may be in a variety of ways:\\n1. Most commonly, nephrolithiasis  and or/ nephrocalcinosis\\n(page 690). These dysfunctions result from excessive\\nexcretion of calcium in the urine due to hypercalcaemiainduced by increased parathyroid hormone level.\\n2.Metastatic calcification , especially in the blood vessels,\\nkidneys, lungs, stomach, eyes and other tissues (page 53).\\n3.Generalised osteitis fibrosa cystica  due to osteoclastic\\nresorption of bone and its replacement by connective tissue\\n(page 835).\\n4.Neuropsychiatric disturbances  such as depression, anxiety,\\npsychosis and coma.\\n5.Hypertension  is found in about half the cases.\\n6.Other changes  such as pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and\\npeptic ulcers due to hypercalcaemia and high parathyroid\\nhormone level are less constant features.\\nSecondary Hyperparathyroidism\\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism occurs due to increased\\nparathyroid hormone elaboration secondary to a diseaseFigure 27.20 Role of parathormone in regulating calcium metabo-\\nlism in the body.\\n817CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine Systemelsewhere in the body. Hypocalcaemia stimulates compen-\\nsatory hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands and causessecondary hyperparathyroidism.\\nETIOLOGY.  Though any condition that causes hypo-\\ncalcaemia stimulates excessive secretion of parathyroid\\nhormone, the important causes of secondary hyper-\\nparathyroidism are as under:\\n1.Chronic renal insufficiency  resulting in retention of\\nphosphate and impaired intestinal absorption of calcium.\\n2.Vitamin D deficiency  and consequent rickets and\\nosteomalacia may cause parathyroid hyperfunction.\\n3.Intestinal malabsorption syndromes causing deficiency of\\ncalcium and vitamin D.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The main biochemical abnormality\\nin secondary hyperparathyroidism is mild hypocalcaemia,\\nin striking contrast to hypercalcaemia in primary\\nhyperparathyroidism. The patients with secondary\\nhyperparathyroidism have signs and symptoms of thedisease which caused it. Usually, secondary hyperparathy-roidism is a beneficial compensatory mechanism, but moresevere cases may be associated with renal osteodystrophy(i.e. features of varying degree of osteitis fibrosa, osteo-\\nmalacia, osteoporosis and osteosclerosis in cases of chronic\\nrenal insufficiency) and soft tissue calcification (Fig. 27.21) .\\nTertiary Hyperparathyroidism\\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism is a complication of secondary\\nhyperparathyroidism in which the hyperfunction persists in\\nspite of removal of the cause of secondary hyperplasia.\\nPossibly, a hyperplastic nodule in the parathyroid glanddevelops which becomes partially autonomous andcontinues to secrete large quantities of parathyroid hormone\\nwithout regard to the needs of the body.\\nHYPOP ARA\\nTHYROIDISM\\nDeficiency or absence of parathyroid hormone secretioncauses hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism is of 3types—primary, pseudo- and  pseudopseudo-hypoparathyroidism.Primary Hypoparathyroidism\\nPrimary hypoparathyroidism is caused by disease of the\\nparathyroid glands. Most common causes of primaryhypoparathyroidism are: surgical procedures involvingthyroid, parathyroid, or radical neck dissection for cancer.Other causes are uncommon and include idiopathichypoparathyroidism of autoimmune origin in children andmay occur as sporadic or familial cases. These cases aregenerally associated with other autoimmune diseases.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES.  The main biochemical dysfunctions\\nin primary hypoparathyroidism are hypocalcaemia,\\nhyperphosphataemia and hypocalciuria. The clinicalmanifestations of these abnormalities are as under:1.Increased neuromuscular irritability and tetany\\n2. Calcification of the lens and cataract formation3.Abnormalities in cardiac conduction\\n4.\\nDisorders of the CNS due to intracranial calcification\\n5. Abnormalities of the teeth.\\nPseudo-hypoparathyroidism\\nIn pseudo-hypoparathyroidism, the tissues fail to respond\\nto parathyroid hormone though parathyroid glands areusually normal. It is a rare inherited condition with anautosomal dominant character. The patients are generallyfemales and are characterised by signs and symptoms ofhypoparathyroidism and other clinical features like shortstature, short metacarpals and metatarsals, flat nose, roundface and multiple exostoses. Since renal tubules cannotadequately respond to parathyroid hormone, there is hyper-calciuria, hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia.\\nPseudopseudo-hypoparathyroidism\\nPseudopseudo-hypoparathyroidism is another rare familial\\ndisorder in which all the clinical features of pseudo-hypoparathyroidism are present except that these patientshave no hypocalcaemia or hyperphosphataemia and thetissues respond normally to parathyroid hormone.Pseudopseudo-hypoparathyroidism has been considered anincomplete form of pseudo-hypoparathyroidism.\\nPARATHYROID TUMOURS\\nParathyroid adenoma and carcinoma are the neoplasms\\nfound in parathyroid glands, the former being much morecommon than the latter.\\nParathyroid Adenoma\\nThe commonest tumour of the parathyroid glands is an\\nadenoma. It may occur at any age and in either sex but isfound more frequently in adult life. Most adenomas are firstbrought to attention because of excessive secretion ofparathyroid hormone causing features of hyperparathy-roidism as described above.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  a parathyroid\\nadenoma is small (less than 5 cm diameter) encapsulated,yellowish-brown, ovoid nodule and weighing up to 5 gmor more.Figure 27.21 Major clinical manifestations of hyperparathyroidism.\\n818SECTION III Systemic PathologyMicroscopically,  majority of adenomas are predominantly\\ncomposed of chief cells arranged in sheets or cords.\\nOxyphil cells and water-clear cells may be foundintermingled in varying proportions. Usually, a rim ofnormal parathyroid parenchyma and fat are presentexternal to the capsule which help to distinguish anadenoma from diffuse hyperplasia.\\nParathyroid Carcinoma\\nCarcinoma of the parathyroid is rare and produces manifes-\\ntations of hyperparathyroidism which is often morepronounced. Carcinoma tends to be irregular in shape andis adherent to the adjacent tissues. Most parathyroidcarcinomas are well-differentiated. It may be difficult todistinguish carcinoma of parathyroid gland from an adenomabut local invasion of adjacent tissues and distant metastasesare helpful criteria of malignancy in such cases.\\nENDOCRINE PANCREAS\\nThe human pancreas, though anatomically a single organ,histologically and functionally, has 2 distinct parts—theexocrine and endocrine. The exocrine part of the gland andits disorders have already been discussed in Chapter 21.The discussion here is focused on the endocrine pancreasand its two main disorders: diabetes mellitus  and islet cell\\ntumours.\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe endocrine pancreas consists of microscopic collections\\nof cells called islets of Langerhans found scattered withinthe pancreatic lobules, as well as individual endocrine cellsfound in duct epithelium and among the acini. The totalweight of endocrine pancreas in the adult, however, doesnot exceed 1-1.5 gm (total weight of pancreas 60-100 gm).The islet cell tissue is greatly concentrated in the tail than inthe head or body of the pancreas. Islets possess no ductalsystem and they drain their secretory products directly intothe circulation. Ultrastructurally and immunohistochemi-cally, 4 major  and 2 minor  types of islet cells are distinguished,\\neach type having its distinct secretory product and function.These are as follows:\\nA. Major cell types:\\n1.Beta ( β) or B cells  comprise about 70% of islet cells and\\nsecrete insulin, the defective response or deficient synthesis\\nof which causes diabetes mellitus.\\n2.Alpha ( α) or A cells  comprise 20% of islet cells and secrete\\nglucagon which induces hyperglycaemia.3. Delta ( δ) or D cells  comprise 5-10% of islet cells and secrete\\nsomatostatin which suppresses both insulin and glucagon\\nrelease.\\n4.Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells or F cells comprise 1-2% of\\nislet cells and secrete pancreatic polypeptide having some\\ngastrointestinal effects.\\nB. Minor cell types:\\n1.D1 cells  elaborate vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)\\nwhich induces glycogenolysis and hyperglycaemia andcauses secretory diarrhoea by stimulation of gastrointestinal\\nfluid secretion.\\n2.Enterochromaffin cells  synthesise serotonin which in\\npancreatic tumours may induce carcinoid syndrome.\\nDIABETES MELLITUS\\nDefinition and Epidemiology\\nAs per the WHO, diabetes mellitus (DM) is defined as a hetro-\\ngeneous metabolic disorder characterised by common featureof chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbance of carbohydrate,\\nfat and protein metabolism.\\nDM is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality world\\nover.  It is estimated that approximately 1% of population\\nsuffers from DM. The incidence is rising in the developedcountries of the world at the rate of about 10% per year,especially of type 2 DM, due to rising incidence of obesity\\nand reduced activity levels.  DM is expected to continue as a\\nmajor health problem owing to its serious complications,especially end-stage renal disease, IHD, gangrene of thelower extremities, and blindness in the adults. It is anticipatedthat the number of diabetics will exceed 250 million by theyear 2010.\\nClassification and Etiology\\nThe older classification systems dividing DM into primary\\n(idiopathic) and secondary types, juvenile-onset and maturityonset types, and insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulindependent (NIDDM) types, have become obsolete and\\nundergone major revision due to extensive understanding\\nof etiology and pathogenesis of DM in recent times.\\nAs outlined in Ta\\nble 27.4 , current classification of DM\\nbased on etiology divides it into two broad categories—type\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 27.4: Etiologic Classification of Diabetes Mellitus\\n(as per American Diabetes Association, 2007).\\nI.

OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF DIABETES (10%)\\nA.

Endocrinopathies (e.g. acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome,\\npheochromocytoma)\\nE. Drug- or chemical-induced (e.g. steroids, thyroid hormone,\\nthiazides, β-blockers etc)\\nF. Infections (e.g. congenital rubella,  cytomegalovirus)\\nG. Uncommon forms of immune-mediated DM (stiff man\\nsyndrome, anti-insulin receptor antibodies)\\nH. Other genetic syndromes (e.g. Down's syndrome, Klinefelter's\\nsyndrome, Turner's syndrome)\\nIV. GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS819CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine System1 and type 2; besides there are a few uncommon specific\\netiologic types, and gestational DM. American DiabetesAssociation (2007) has identified risk factors for type 2 DMlisted in Table 27.5.\\nBrief comments on etiologic terminologies as contrasted\\nwith former nomenclatures of DM are as under:\\nTYPE 1 DM.  It constitutes about 10% cases of DM. It was\\npreviously termed as juvenile-onset diabetes (JOD) due to\\nits occurrence in younger age, and was called insulin-dependent DM (IDDM) because it was known that thesepatients have absolute requirement for insulin replacementas treatment. However, in the new classification, neither agenor insulin-dependence are considered as absolute criteria.Instead, based on underlying etiology, type 1 DM is furtherdivided into 2 subtypes:\\nSubtype 1A (immune-mediated) DM  characterised by\\nautoimmune destruction of β-cells which usually leads to\\ninsulin deficiency.\\nSubtype 1B (idiopathic) DM  characterised by insulin\\ndeficiency with tendency to develop ketosis but these patients\\nare negative for autoimmune markers.\\nThough type 1 DM occurs commonly in patients under\\n30 years of age, autoimmune destruction of β-cells can occur\\nat any age. In fact, 5-10% patients who develop DM above30 years of age are of type 1A DM and hence the term JODhas become obsolete.\\nTYPE 2 DM.  This type comprises about 80% cases of DM. It\\nwas previously called maturity-onset diabetes, or non-insulin\\ndependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) of obese and non-obese type.\\nAlthough type 2 DM predominantly affects older\\nindividuals, it is now known that it also occurs in obeseadolescent children; hence the term MOD for it isinappropriate. Moreover, many type 2 DM patients alsorequire insulin therapy to control hyperglycaemia or toprevent ketosis and thus are not truly non-insulin dependentcontrary to its former nomenclature.\\nOTHER SPECIFIC ETIOLOGIC TYPES OF DM. Besides\\nthe two main types, about 10% cases of DM have a known\\nspecific etiologic defect listed in Table 27.4 . One important\\nsubtype in this group is maturity-onset diabetes of the young\\n(MODY) which has autosomal dominant inheritance, early\\nonset of hyperglycaemia and impaired insulin secretion.GESTATIONAL DM . About 4% pregnant women develop\\nDM due to metabolic changes during pregnancy. Althoughthey revert back to normal glycaemia after delivery, thesewomen are prone to develop DM later in their life.\\nPathogenesis\\nDepending upon etiology of DM, hyperglycaemia may result\\nfrom the following:\\nReduced insulin secretion\\nDecreased glucose use by the body\\nIncreased glucose production.\\nPathogenesis of two main types of DM and its\\ncomplications is distinct. In order to understand it properly,\\nit is essential to first recall physiology of normal insulinsynthesis and secretion.\\nNORMAL INSULIN METABOLISM.  The major stimulus for\\nboth synthesis and release of insulin is glucose.  The steps involved\\nin biosynthesis, release and actions of insulin are as follows\\n(Fig. 27.22) :\\nSynthesis.  Insulin is synthesised in the β-cells of pancreatic\\nislets of Langerhans:\\ni) It is initially formed as pre-proinsulin  which is single-chain\\n86-amino acid precursor polypeptide.\\nii) Subsequent proteolysis removes the amino terminal signal\\npeptide, forming proinsulin .\\niii) Further cleavage of proinsulin gives rise to A (21 amino\\nacids) and B (30 amino acids) chains  of insulin, linked together\\nby connecting segment called C-peptide , all of which are\\nstored in the secretory granules in the β-cells. As compared\\nto A and B chains of insulin, C-peptide is less susceptible todegradation in the liver and is therefore used as a marker todistinguish endogenously synthesised and exogenouslyadministered insulin.\\nFor therapeutic purposes, human insulin  is now produced\\nby recombinant DNA technology.\\nRelease. Glucose is the key regulator of insulin secretion from\\nβ-cells by a series of steps:\\ni) Hypoglycaemia (glucose level below 70 mg/dl or below\\n3.9 mmol/L) stimulates transport into β-cells of a glucose\\ntransporter, GLUT2 . Other stimuli influencing insulin release\\ninclude nutrients in the meal, ketones, amino acids etc.\\nii\\n) An islet transcription factor, glucokinase,  causes glucose\\nphosphorylation, and thus acts as a step for controlled release\\nof glucose-regulated insulin secretion.\\niii) Metabolism of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by\\nglycolysis generates ATP .\\niv) Generation of ATP alters the ion channel activity  on the\\nmembrane. It causes inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channel\\non the cell membrane and opening up of calcium channelwith resultant influx of calcium, which stimulates insulinrelease.\\nAction.  Half of insulin secreted from  β-cells into portal vein\\nis degraded in the liver while the remaining half enters the\\nsystemic circulation for action on the target cells:\\ni) Insulin from circulation binds to its receptor on the target\\ncells. Insulin receptor  has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.\\nii) This, in turn, activates post-receptor intracellular signallingpathway molecules, insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1 and 2\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 27.5.

The basic phenomenon in\\ntype 1 DM is destruction of \\nβ-cell mass, usually leading to absolute\\ninsulin deficiency.  While type 1B DM remains idiopathic,\\npathogenesis of type 1A DM is immune-mediated and has\\nbeen extensively studied. Currently, pathogenesis of type 1ADM is explained on the basis of 3 mutually-interlinkedmechanisms: genetic susceptibility, autoimmune factors, and\\ncertain environmental factors (Fig. 27.23,A).\\n1. Genetic susceptibility.  Type 1A DM involves inheritance\\nof multiple genes to confer susceptibility to the disorder:\\ni)It has been observed in identical twins  that if one twin has\\ntype 1A DM, there is about 50% chance of the second twin\\ndeveloping it, but not all. This means that some additionalmodifying factors are involved in development of DM inthese cases.\\nii)\\nAbout half the cases with genetic predisposition to type\\n1A DM have the susceptibility gene  located in the HLA region\\nof chromosome 6 (MHC class II region), particularly HLA\\nDR3, HLA DR4  and HLA DQ locus.\\n2. Autoimmune factors.  Studies on humans and animal\\nmodels on type 1A DM have shown several immunologic\\nabnormalities:i)\\uf020Presence of islet cell antibodies against GAD (glutamic\\nacid decarboxylase), insulin etc, though their assay largely\\nremains a research tool due to tedious method.\\nii) Occurrence of lymphocytic infiltrate in and around the\\npancreatic islets termed insulitis . It chiefly consists of CD8+\\nT lymphocytes with variable number of CD4+ T lymphocytesand macrophages.\\niii)Selective destruction of \\nβ-cells while other islet cell types\\n(glucagon-producing alpha cells, somatostatin-producing\\ndelta cells, or polypeptide-forming PP cells) remainunaffected. This is mediated by T-cell mediated cytotoxicityor by apoptosis.\\niv) Role of T cell-mediated autoimmunity  is further supported\\nby transfer of type 1A DM from diseased animal by infusing\\nT lymphocytes to a healthy animal.\\nv) Association of type 1A DM with other autoimmune diseases\\nin about 10-20% cases such as Graves’ disease, Addison’s\\ndisease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, pernicious anaemia.\\nvi) Remission of type 1A DM in response to immunosuppres-\\nsive therapy such as administration of cyclosporin A.\\n3.  Environmental  factors.  Epidemiologic studies in type 1A\\nDM suggest the involvement of certain environmental factors\\nin its pathogenesis, though role of none of them has beenconclusively proved. In fact, the trigger may precede theoccurrence of the disease by several years. It appears thatcertain viral and dietary proteins share antigenic propertieswith human cell surface proteins and trigger the immuneattack on β-cells by a process of molecular mimicry. These\\nfactors include the following:\\ni)Certain viral infections  preceding the onset of disease e.g.\\nmumps, measles, coxsackie B virus, cytomegalovirus and\\ninfectious mononucleosis.\\nii)Experimental induction  of type 1A DM with certain\\nchemicals has been possible e.g. alloxan, streptozotocin and\\npentamidine.Figure 27.22 A, Pathway of normal insulin synthesis and release in β-cells of pancreatic islets. B, Chain of events in action of insulin on target\\ncell.\\n821CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine SystemFigure 27.23 Schematic mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of two main types of diabetes mellitus.\\niii)Geographic and seasonal variations  in its incidence suggest\\nsome common environmental factors.\\niv) Possible relationship of early exposure to bovine milk\\nproteins and occurrence of autoimmune process in type 1A\\nDM is being studied.\\nKEY POINTS:   Pathogenesis of type 1A DM can be summed\\nup by interlinking the above three factors as under:\\n1. At birth, individuals with genetic susceptibility  to this\\ndisorder have normal β-cell mass.\\n2. β-cells act as autoantigens and activate CD4+ T lympho-\\ncytes, bringing about immune destruction of pancreatic β-cells by autoimmune phenomena  and takes months to years.\\nClinical features of diabetes manifest after more than 80% ofβ-cell mass has been destroyed.\\n3. The trigger for autoimmune process appears to be someinfectious or environmental factor  which specifically targets\\nβ-cells.\\nPATHOGENESIS OF TYPE 2 DM.   The basic metabolic\\ndefect in type 2 DM is either a delayed insulin secretionrelative to glucose load (impaired insulin secretion),  or the\\nperipheral tissues are unable to respond to insulin (insulin\\nresistance).\\nType 2 DM is a heterogeneous disorder with a more\\ncomplex etiology and is far more common than type 1, butmuch less is known about its pathogenesis.  A number offactors have been implicated though, but HLA associationand autoimmune phenomena are not implicated. Thesefactors are as under (Fig. 27.23,B) :1.Genetic factors.  Genetic component has a stronger basis\\nfor type 2 DM than type 1A DM. Although no definite andconsistent genes have been identified, multifactorialinheritance is the most important factor in development oftype 2 DM:\\ni)There is approximately 80% chance of developing\\ndiabetes in the other identical twin  if one twin has the disease.\\ni\\ni) A person with one parent having type 2 DM is at an\\nincreased risk of getting diabetes, but if both parents have type\\n2 DM the risk in the offspring rises to 40%.\\n2. Constitutional factors. Certain environmental factors\\nsuch as obesity, hypertension, and level of physical activity\\nplay contributory role and modulate the phenotyping of thedisease.\\n3. Insulin resistance.  One of the most prominent metabolic\\nfeatures of type 2 DM is the lack of responsiveness of\\nperipheral tissues to insulin, especially of the skeletal muscleand liver. Obesity, in particular, is strongly associated withinsulin resistance and hence type 2 DM. Mechanism ofhyperglycaemia in these cases is explained as under:\\ni) Resistance to action of insulin impairs glucose utilisation\\nand hence hyperglycaemia.\\nii) There is increased hepatic synthesis  of glucose.\\niii)Hyperglycaemia in obesity  is related to high levels of free\\nfatty acids and cytokines (e.g. TNF- α and adiponectin) affect\\nperipheral tissue sensitivity to respond to insulin.\\nThe precise underlying molecular defect responsible for\\ninsulin resistance in type 2 DM has yet not been fully\\n822SECTION III Systemic Pathologyidentified. Currently, it is proposed that insulin resistance\\nmay be possibly due to one of the following defects:\\nPolymorphism in various post-receptor intracellular signal\\npathway molecules .\\nElevated free fatty acids  seen in obesity may contribute e.g.\\nby impaired glucose utilisation in the skeletal muscle, byincreased hepatic synthesis of glucose, and by impairedβ-cell function.\\nInsulin resistance syndrome  is a complex of clinical features\\noccurring from insulin resistance and its resultant metabolicderangements that includes hyperglycaemia andcompensatory hyperinsulinaemia. The clinical features arein the form of accelerated cardiovascular disease and mayoccur in both obese as well as non-obese type 2 DM patients.The features include: mild hypertension (related toendothelial dysfunction) and dyslipidaemia (characterisedby reduced HDL level, increased triglycerides and LDL level).\\n4. Impaired insulin secretion. In type 2 DM, insulin\\nresistance and insulin secretion are interlinked:\\ni)\\uf020Early in the course of disease, in response to insulin\\nresistance there is compensatory increased secretion of\\ninsulin ( hyperinsulinaemia ) in an attempt to maintain normal\\nblood glucose level.\\nii)\\uf020Eventually, however, there is failure of \\nβ-cell function  to\\nsecrete adequate insulin, although there is some secretion of\\ninsulin i.e. cases of type 2 DM have mild to moderatedeficiency of insulin (which is much less severe than that intype 1 DM) but not its total absence.\\nThe exact genetic mechanism why there is a fall in insulin\\nsecretion in these cases is unclear. However, followingpossibilities are proposed:\\nIslet amyloid polypeptide ( amylin ) which forms fibrillar\\nprotein deposits in pancreatic islets in longstanding cases oftype 2 DM may be responsible for impaired function ofβ-cells of islet cells.\\nMetabolic environment of chronic hyperglycaemia\\nsurrounding the islets (glucose toxicity)  may paradoxically\\nimpair islet cell function.\\nElevated free fatty acid levels ( lipotoxicity ) in these cases\\nmay worsen islet cell function.\\n5. Increased hepatic glucose synthesis. One of the normal\\nroles played by insulin is to promote hepatic storage of\\nglucose as glycogen and suppress gluconeogenesis. In type2 DM, as a part of insulin resistance by peripheral tissues,the liver also shows insulin resistance i.e. in spite of hyper-insulinaemia in the early stage of disease, gluconeogenesisin the liver is not suppressed. This results in increased hepaticsynthesis of glucose which contributes to hyperglycaemiain these cases.\\nKEY POINTS:   In essence, hyperglycaemia in type 2 DM is\\nnot due to destruction of β-cells but is instead a failure of β-\\ncells to meet the requirement of insulin in the body. Its\\npathogenesis can be summed up by interlinking the abovefactors as under:\\n1. Type 2 DM is a more complex multifactorial disease .\\n2. There is greater role of genetic defect and heredity .3. Two main mechanisms for hyperglycaemia in type 2 DM—\\ninsulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion , are interlinked.\\n4. While obesity plays a role in pathogenesis of insulin\\nresistance, impaired insulin secretion may be from manyconstitutional factors.\\n5. Increased hepatic synthesis of glucose  in initial period of\\ndisease contributes to hyperglycaemia.\\nMorphologic Features in Pancreatic Islet s\\nMorphologic changes in islets have been demonstrated\\nin both types of diabetes, though the changes are moredistinctive in type 1 DM:\\n1. Insulitis:\\nIn type 1 DM, characteristically, in early stage there is\\nlymphocytic infiltrate, mainly by T cells, in the islets which\\nmay be accompanied by a few macrophages andpolymorphs. Diabetic infants born to diabetic mothers,however, have eosinophilic infiltrate in the islets.\\nIn type 2 DM, there is no significant leucocytic infiltrate\\nin the islets but there is variable degree of fibrous tissue\\nin the islets.\\n2.Islet cell mass:\\nIn type 1 DM, as the disease becomes chronic there is\\nprogressive depletion of β−cell mass, eventually resulting\\nin total loss of pancreatic β−cells and its hyalinisation.\\nIn type 2 DM,   β-cell mass is either normal or mildly\\nreduced. Infants of diabetic mothers, however, have\\nhyperplasia and hypertrophy of islets as a compensatoryresponse to maternal hyperglycaemia.\\n3.\\nAmyloidosis:\\nIn type 1 DM,  deposits of amyloid around islets are\\nabsent.\\nIn type 2 DM,  characteristically chronic long-standing\\ncases show deposition of  amyloid material, amylin,\\naround the capillaries of the islets causing compressionand atrophy of islet tissue  (Fig. 27.24) .\\nFigure 27.24 Amyloidosis of the pancreatic islet tissue.

However, overlapping of\\nclinical features occurs as regards the age of onset, durationof symptoms and family history.

Non-enzymatic protein glycosylation:  The free amino\\ngroup of various body proteins binds by non-enzymaticmechanism to glucose; this process is called glycosylation  and\\nis directly proportionate to the severity of hyperglycaemia.Various body proteins undergoing chemical alterations inthis way include haemoglobin, lens crystalline protein, andbasement membrane of body cells. An example is themeasurement of a fraction of haemoglobin calledglycosylated haemoglobin (HbA\\n1C) as a test for monitoring\\nglycaemic control in a diabetic patient  during the preceding\\nFigure 27.26 Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus. A, Pathogenesis. B, Secondary systemic complications.\\n825CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine System>90 to 120 days which is lifespan of red cells (page 288) .\\nSimilarly, there is accumulation of labile and reversible glyco-sylation products on collagen and other tissues of the bloodvessel wall which subsequently become stable andirreversible by chemical changes and form advanced glyco-sylation end-products (AGE). The AGEs bind to receptorson different cells and produce a variety of biologic andchemical changes e.g. thickening of vascular basementmembrane in diabetes.\\n2. Polyol pathway mechanism.  This mechanism is\\nresponsible for producing lesions in the aorta, lens of the\\neye, kidney and peripheral nerves. These tissues have anenzyme, aldose reductase, that reacts with glucose to formsorbitol and fructose in the cells of the hyperglycaemic patientas under:\\n    aldose reductase\\nGlucose + NADH + H+ Sorbitol + NAD+\\nsorbitol\\ndehydrogenase\\nSorbitol + NAD  Fructose + NADH + H+\\nIntracellular accumulation of sorbitol and fructose so\\nproduced results in entry of water inside the cell andconsequent cellular swelling and cell damage. Also, intra-cellular accumulation of sorbitol causes intracellulardeficiency of myoinositol which promotes injury to Schwanncells and retinal pericytes. These polyols result in disturbedprocessing of normal intermediary metabolites leading tocomplications of diabetes.\\n3. Excessive oxygen free radicals. In hyperglycaemia, there\\nis increased production of reactive oxygen free radicals from\\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation which may damagevarious target cells in diabetes.\\nComplications of Diabetes\\nAs a consequence of hyperglycaemia of diabetes, every tissue\\nand organ of the body undergoes biochemical and structuralalterations which account for the major complications indiabetics which may be acute metabolic  or chronic systemic .\\nBoth types of diabetes mellitus may develop compli-\\ncations which are broadly divided into 2 major groups:\\nI.Acute metabolic complications:  These include diabetic\\nketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, and\\nhypoglycaemia.\\nII.Late systemic complications:  These are atherosclerosis,\\ndiabetic microangiopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic\\nneuropathy, diabetic retinopathy and infections.\\nI. ACUTE METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS.  Metabolic\\ncomplications develop acutely. While ketoacidosis and\\nhypoglycaemic episodes are primarily complications of type1 DM, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma is chiefly acomplication of type 2 DM (also see Fig. 27.25).\\n1.Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  Ketoacidosis is almost\\nexclusively a complication of type 1 DM. It can develop in\\npatients with severe insulin deficiency combined withglucagon excess. Failure to take insulin and exposure to stressare the usual precipitating causes. Severe lack of insulincauses lipolysis in the adipose tissues, resulting in release offree fatty acids into the plasma. These free fatty acids aretaken up by the liver where they are oxidised through acetylcoenzyme-A to ketone bodies, principally acetoacetic acidand β-hydroxybutyric acid. Such free fatty acid oxidation to\\nketone bodies is accelerated in the presence of elevated levelof glucagon. Once the rate of ketogenesis exceeds the rate atwhich the ketone bodies can be utilised by the muscles andother tissues, ketonaemia and ketonuria occur. If urinaryexcretion of ketone bodies is prevented due to dehydration,systemic metabolic ketoacidosis occurs. Clinically, thecondition is characterised by anorexia, nausea, vomitings,deep and fast breathing, mental confusion and coma. Mostpatients of ketoacidosis recover.\\n2\\n. Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic nonketotic coma (HHS).\\nHyperosmolar hyperglycaemic nonketotic coma is usually a\\ncomplication of type 2 DM. It is caused by severe dehydrationresulting from sustained hyperglycaemic diuresis. The lossof glucose in urine is so intense that the patient is unable todrink sufficient water to maintain urinary fluid loss. Theusual clinical features of ketoacidosis are absent butprominent central nervous signs are present. Blood sugar isextremely high and plasma osmolality is high. Thromboticand bleeding complications are frequent due to high viscosityof blood. The mortality rate in hyperosmolar nonketotic comais high.\\nThe contrasting features of diabetic ketoacidosis and\\nhyperosmolar non-ketotic coma are summarised in\\nTable 27.7.\\n3. Hypoglycaemia.  Hypoglycaemic episode may develop\\nin patients of type 1 DM. It may result from excessive\\nadministration of insulin, missing a meal, or due to stress.Hypoglycaemic episodes are harmful as they producepermanent brain damage, or may result in worsening ofdiabetic control and rebound hyperglycaemia, so calledSomogyi’s effect.\\nII.

Late complications are\\nlargely responsible for morbidity and premature mortalityin diabetes mellitus. These complications are briefly outlinedbelow as they are discussed in detail in relevant chapters(Fig. 27.26,B).\\n1. Atherosclerosis.  Diabetes mellitus of both type 1 and\\ntype 2 accelerates the development of atherosclerosis.\\nConsequently, atherosclerotic lesions appear earlier than inthe general population, are more extensive, and are moreoften associated with complicated plaques such as ulceration,calcification and thrombosis (page 398). The cause for thisaccelerated atherosclerotic process is not known but possiblecontributory factors are hyperlipidaemia, reduced HDLlevels, nonenzymatic glycosylation, increased plateletadhesiveness, obesity and associated hypertension indiabetes.\\nThe possible ill-effects of accelerated atherosclerosis in\\ndiabetes are early onset of coronary artery disease, silentmyocardial infarction, cerebral stroke and gangrene of thetoes and feet. Gangrene of the lower extremities is 100 timesmore common in diabetics than in non-diabetics.\\n2.Diabetic microangiopathy.  Microangiopathy of diabetes\\nis characterised by basement membrane thickening of small\\nblood vessels and capillaries of different organs and tissuessuch as the skin, skeletal muscle, eye and kidney. Similartype of basement membrane-like material is also depositedin nonvascular tissues such as peripheral nerves, renaltubules and Bowman’s capsule. The pathogenesis of diabeticmicroangiopathy as well as of peripheral neuropathy in dia-betics is believed to be due to recurrent hyperglycaemia thatcauses increased glycosylation  of haemoglobin and other\\nproteins (e.g. collagen and basement membrane material)resulting in thickening of basement membrane.\\n3.\\nDiabetic nephropathy.  Renal involvement is a common\\ncomplication and a leading cause of death in diabetes. Four\\ntypes of lesions are described in diabetic nephropathy (page677):\\ni)Diabetic glomerulosclerosis  which includes diffuse and\\nnodular lesions of glomerulosclerosis.ii)Vascular lesions  that include hyaline arteriolosclerosis of\\nafferent and efferent arterioles and atheromas of renal\\narteries.\\niii)Diabetic pyelonephritis  and necrotising renal papillitis.\\niv)Tubular lesions or Armanni-Ebstein lesion.\\n4. Diabetic neuropathy.  Diabetic neuropathy may affect all\\nparts of the nervous system but symmetric peripheral\\nneuropathy is most characteristic. The basic pathologicchanges are segmental demyelination, Schwann cell injuryand axonal damage (page 892). The pathogenesis ofneuropathy is not clear but it may be related to diffusemicroangiopathy as already explained, or may be due toaccumulation of sorbitol and fructose as a result ofhyperglycaemia, leading to deficiency of myoinositol.\\n5. Diabetic retinopathy.  Diabetic retinopathy is a leading\\ncause of blindness. There are 2 types of lesions involving\\nretinal vessels: background and proliferative  (page 508). Besides\\nretinopathy, diabetes also predisposes the patients to earlydevelopment of cataract and glaucoma.6. Infections.  Diabetics have enhanced susceptibility to\\nvarious infections such as tuberculosis, pneumonias,pyelonephritis, otitis, carbuncles and diabetic ulcers. Thiscould be due to various factors such as impaired leucocytefunctions, reduced cellular immunity, poor blood supply dueto vascular involvement and hyperglycaemia per se.\\nDiagnosis of Diabetes\\nHyperglycaemia remains the fundamental basis for the\\ndiagnosis of diabetes mellitus. In symptomatic cases,  the\\ndiagnosis is not a problem and can be confirmed by findingglucosuria and a random plasma glucose concentrationabove 200 mg/dl.\\nThe severity of clinical symptoms of polyuria and\\npolydipsia is directly related to the degree of hyperglycaemia.\\nIn asymptomatic cases, when there is persistently elevated\\nfasting plasma glucose level, diagnosis again poses nodifficulty.\\nThe problem arises in asymptomatic patients who have\\nnormal fasting glucose level in the plasma but are suspectedto have diabetes on other grounds and are thus subjected tooral glucose tolerance test (GTT). If abnormal GTT valuesare found, these subjects are said to have ‘chemical diabetes’\\n(Fig. 27.27) . The American Diabetes Association (2007) has\\nrecommended definite diagnostic criteria for early diagnosisof diabetes mellitus (Table 27.8).\\nThe following investigations are helpful in establishing\\nthe diagnosis of diabetes mellitus:\\nI. URINE TESTING.  Urine tests are cheap and convenient\\nbut the diagnosis of diabetes cannot be based on urine testing\\nalone since there may be false-positives and false-negatives.They can be used in population screening surveys. Urine istested for the presence of glucose and ketones.\\n1.Glucosuria.  Benedict’s qualitative test  detects any reducing\\nsubstance in the urine and is not specific for glucose. More\\n\\uf075\\uf075TABLE 27.8: Revised Criteria for Diagnosis of Diabetes by\\nOral GTT (as per American Diabetes Association, 2007).\\nPlasma Glucose Value* Diagnosis\\nFASTING  (FOR > 8 HOURS) VALUE\\nBelow 100 mg/dl (< 5.6 mmol/L) Normal fasting value\\n100-125 mg/dl (5.6-6.9 mmol/L) Impaired fasting glucose (IFG)**\\n126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) or more Diabetes mellitus\\nTWO-HOUR AFTER 75 GM ORAL GLUCOSE LOAD< 140 mg/dl (< 7.8 mmol/L) Normal post-prandial GTT\\n140-199 mg/dl (7.8-11.1 mmol/L) Impaired post-prandial glucose\\ntolerance (IGT)**\\n200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) or more Diabetes mellitus\\nRANDOM VALUE\\n200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) or more Diabetes mellitus\\nin a symptomatic patient\\nNote: * Plasma glucose values are 15% higher than whole blood glucose\\nvalue.\\n** Individuals with  IFG and IGT are at increased risk for development oftype 2 DM later.827CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine Systemsensitive and glucose specific test is dipstick  method based\\non enzyme-coated paper strip which turns purple when\\ndipped in urine containing glucose.\\nThe main disadvantage of relying on urinary glucose test\\nalone is the individual variation in renal threshold. Thus, adiabetic patient may have a negative urinary glucose testand a nondiabetic individual with low renal threshold mayhave a positive urine test.\\nBesides diabetes mellitus, glucosuria  may also occur in\\ncertain other conditions such as: renal glycosuria, alimentary(lag storage) glucosuria, many metabolic disorders,starvation and intracranial lesions (e.g. cerebral tumour,haemorrhage and head injury). However, two of theseconditions—renal glucosuria and alimentary glucosuria,require further elaboration here.\\nRenal glucosuria (Fig. 27.27,B): After diabetes, the next\\nmost common cause of glucosuria is the reduced renalthreshold for glucose. In such cases although the bloodglucose level is below 180 mg/dl (i.e. below normal renalthreshold for glucose) but glucose still appears regularly andconsistently in the urine due to lowered renal threshold.\\nRenal glucosuria is a benign condition unrelated to\\ndiabetes and runs in families and may occur temporarily inpregnancy without symptoms of diabetes.\\nAlimentary (lag storage) glucosuria (Fig. 27.27,C):  A rapid\\nand transitory rise in blood glucose level above the normalrenal threshold may occur in some individuals after a meal.During this period, glucosuria is present. This type ofresponse to meal is called ‘lag storage curve’ or moreappropriately ‘alimentary glucosuria’. A characteristicfeature is that unusually high blood glucose level returns tonormal 2 hours after meal.\\n2. Ketonuria.  Tests for ketone bodies in the urine are\\nrequired for assessing the severity of diabetes and not for\\ndiagnosis of diabetes. However, if both glucosuria andketonuria are present, diagnosis of diabetes is almost certain.Rothera’s test  (nitroprusside reaction) and strip test  are\\nconveniently performed for detection of ketonuria.Besides uncontrolled diabetes, ketonuria may appear in\\nindividuals with prolonged vomitings, fasting state orexercising for long periods.\\nII\\n. SINGLE BLOOD SUGAR ESTIMATION.  For diag-\\nnosis of diabetes, blood sugar determinations are absolutely\\nnecessary. Folin-Wu method  of measurement of all reducing\\nsubstances in the blood including glucose is now obsolete.Currently used are O-toluidine, Somogyi-Nelson  and glucose\\noxidase  methods. Whole blood or plasma may be used but\\nwhole blood values are 15% lower than plasma values.\\nA grossly elevated single determination of plasma\\nglucose may be sufficient to make the diagnosis of diabetes.A fasting plasma glucose value above 126 mg/dl (\\n>7 mmol/L) is\\ncertainly indicative of diabetes.  In other cases, oral GTT is\\nperformed.\\nIII. SCREENING BY FASTING GLUCOSE TEST. Fasting\\nplasma glucose determnitation is a screening test for DM\\ntype 2. It is recommended that all individuals above 45 yearsof age must undergo screening fasting glucose test every3-years , and relatively earlier if the person is overweight or\\nat risk because of the following reasons:\\ni)Many of the cases meeting the current criteria of DM are\\nasymptomatic and donot know that they have the disorder.i\\ni) Studies have shown that type 2 DM may be present for\\nabout 10 years before symptomatic disease appears.iii) About half the cases of type 2 DM have some diabetes-\\nrelated comlication at the time of diagnosis.\\niv) The course of disease is favourably  altered with treat-\\nment.\\nIV. ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST.  Oral GTT is\\nperformed principally for patients with borderline fasting\\nplasma glucose value (i.e. between 100-140 mg/dl). Thepatient who is scheduled for oral GTT is instructed to eat ahigh carbohydrate diet for at least 3 days prior to the testand come after an overnight fast on the day of the test (for atleast 8 hours). A fasting blood sugar sample is first drawn.Figure 27.27 The glucose tolerance test, showing blood glucose curves (venous blood glucose) and glucosuria after 75 gm of oral glucose.\\n828SECTION III Systemic PathologyThen 75 gm of glucose dissolved in 300 ml of water is given.\\nBlood and urine specimen are collected at half-hourlyintervals for at least 2 hours. Blood or plasma glucose contentis measured and urine is tested for glucosuria to determinethe approximate renal threshold for glucose. Venous wholeblood concentrations are 15% lower than plasma glucosevalues.\\nCurrently accepted criteria for diagnosis of DM (as per\\nAmerican Diabetes Association, 2007) are given in Table 27.8:\\nNormal cut off value for fasting blood glucose level is\\nconsidered as 100 mg/dl.\\nCases with fasting blood glucose value in range of 100-\\n125 mg/dl are considered as impaired fasting glucose tolerance\\n(IGT); these cases  are at increased risk of developing diabetes\\nlater and therefore kept under observation for repeating thetest. During pregnancy, however, a case of IGT is treated asa diabetic.\\n\\uf020Individuals with fasting value of plasma glucose higher\\nthan 126 mg/dl and 2-hour value after 75 gm oral glucosehigher than 200 mg/dl are labelled as diabetics  (Fig. 27.27,D).\\nIn symptomatic case, the random blood glucose value\\nabove 200 mg/dl is diagnosed as diabetes mellitus.\\nV. OTHER TESTS.  A few other tests are sometimes\\nperformed in specific conditions in diabetics and for research\\npurposes:\\n1.Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C). Measurement of\\nblood glucose level in diabetics suffers from variation due\\nto dietary intake of the previous day. Long-term objectiveassessment of degree of glycaemic control is bettermonitored by measurement of glycosylated haemoglobin(HbA\\n1C), a minor haemoglobin component present in normal\\npersons. This is because the non-enzymatic glycosylation ofhaemoglobin takes place over 90-120 days, lifespan of redblood cells. HbA\\n1C assay, therefore, gives an estimate of\\ndiabetic control and compliance for the preceding 3-4months. This assay has the advantage over traditional bloodglucose test that no dietary preparation or fasting is required.Increased HbA\\n1C  value almost certainly means DM but\\nnormal value does not rule out IGT; thus the test is not usedfor making the diagnosis of DM. Moreover, since HbA\\n1C\\nassay has a direct relation between poor control anddevelopment of complications, it is also a good measure ofprediction of microvascular complications. Care must betaken in iterpretation of the HbA\\n1C value because it varies\\nwith the assay method used and is affected by presence ofhaemoglobinopathies, anaemia, reticulocytosis, transfusionsand uraemia.\\n2. Glycated albumin.  This is used to monitor degree of\\nhyperglycaemia during previous 1-2 weeks when HbA\\n1C can\\nnot be used.\\n3. Extended GTT.  The oral GTT is extended to 3-4 hours for\\nappearance of symptoms of hyperglycaemia. It is a useful\\ntest in cases of reactive hypoglycaemia of early diabetes.\\n4. Intravenous GTT.  This test is performed in persons who\\nhave intestinal malabsorption or in postgastrectomy cases.\\n5. Cortisone-primed GTT.  This provocative test is a useful\\ninvestigative aid in cases of potential diabetics.6. Insulin assay.  Plasma insulin can be measured by\\nradioimmunoasay and ELISA technique. Plasma insulin\\ndeficiency is crucial for type 1 DM but is not essential formaking the diagnosis of DM.\\n7. Proinsulin assay. Proinsulin is included in immunoassay\\nof insulin; normally it is \\n<20% of total insulin.\\n8. C-peptide  assay.  C-peptide is released in circulation\\nduring conversion of proinsulin to insulin in equimolarquantities to insulin; thus its levels correlate with insulin levelin blood except in islet cell tumours and in obesity. This testis even more sensitive than insulin assay because its levelsare not affected by insulin therapy.\\n9. Islet autoantibodies.  Glutamic acid decarboxylase and\\nislet cell cytoplasmic antibodies may be used  as a marker for\\ntype 1 DM.\\n10. Screening for diabetes-associated complications.\\nBesides making the diagnosis of DM based on the definedcriteria, screening tests are done for DM-associatedcomplications e.g. microalbuniuria, dyslipidaemia, thyroiddysfunction etc.\\nISLET CELL TUMOURS\\nIslet cell tumours are rare as compared with tumours of the\\nexocrine pancreas. Islet cell tumours are generally small andmay be hormonally inactive or may produce hyperfunction.They may be benign or malignant, single or multiple. They\\nare named according to their histogenesis such as: β-cell\\ntumour (insulinoma), G-cell tumour (gastrinoma), A-celltumour (glucagonoma) D-cell tumour (somatostatinoma),\\nvipoma (diarrhoeagenic tumour from D\\n1 cells which elaborate\\nVIP), pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-secreting tumour, andcarcinoid tumour. However, except insulinoma andgastrinoma, all others are extremely rare and require nofurther comments.\\nInsulinoma ( β ββ ββ-Cell Tumour)\\nInsulinomas or beta ( β)-cell tumours are the most common\\nislet cell tumours. The neoplastic β-cells secrete insulin into\\nthe blood stream which remains unaffected by normal\\nregulatory mechanisms. This results in characteristic attacksof hypolgycaemia with blood glucose level falling to 50 mg/dl or below, high plasma insulin level (hyperinsulinism) and\\nhigh insulin-glucose ratio. The central nervous mani-\\nfestations are conspicuous which are promptly relieved byintake of glucose. Besides insulinoma, however, there areother causes of hypoglycaemia such as: in starvation, partialgastrectomy, diffuse liver disease, hypopituitarism and\\nhypofunction of adrenal cortex.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  insulinoma is\\nusually solitary and well-encapsulated tumour which mayvary in size from 0.5 to 10 cm. Rarely, they are multiple.Microscopically,  the tumour is composed of cords and\\nsheets of well-differentiated β-cells which do not differ\\nfrom normal cells. Electron microscopy reveals typicalcrystalline rectangular granules in the neoplastic cells. Itis extremely difficult to assess the degree of anaplasia todistinguish benign from malignant β-cell tumour.829CHAPTER 27 The Endocrine SystemGastrinoma\\n(G-Cell Tumour, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome)\\nZollinger and Ellison described diagnostic triad consisting\\nof the following:\\nFulminant peptic ulcer disease\\nGastric acid hypersecretion\\nPresence of non- β pancreatic islet cell tumour.\\nSuch non- β pancreatic islet cell tumour is the source of\\ngastrin, producing hypergastrinaemia and hence namedgastrinoma. Definite G cells similar to intestinal and gastricG cells which are normally the source of gastrin in the body,have not been identified in the normal human pancreas butneoplastic cells of certain islet cell tumours haveultrastructural similarities.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Majority of gastrinomas\\noccur in the wall of the duodenum. They may be benignor malignant. Gastrinomas are associated with pepticulcers at usual sites such as the stomach, first and secondpart of the duodenum, or sometimes at unusual sites suchas in the oesophagus and jejunum. About one-third ofpatients have multiple endocrine neoplasia—multipleadenomas of the islet cells, pituitary, adrenal andparathyroid glands.\\nMISCELLANEOUS ENDOCRINE TUMOURS\\nMULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA (MEN)SYNDROMES\\nMultiple adenomas and hyperplasias of different endocrine\\norgans are a group of genetic diorders which produceheterogeneous clinical features called multiple endocrineneoplasia (MEN) syndromes. Presently, 4 distinct types ofMEN syndromes are distinguished. These are briefly outlinedbelow along with major disease associations:\\n1.MEN type 1 syndrome (Wermer’s syndrome) includes\\nadenomas of the parathyroid glands, pancreatic islets and\\npituitary. The syndrome is inherited as an autosomaldominant trait. There is 50% chance of transmitting thepredisposing gene, MEN 1 (or menin ) gene, to the child of an\\naffected person. MEN 1 is characterised by the followingfeatures:\\n1. Parathyroid:  Hyperplasia or adenoma; hyperparathy-\\nroidism is the most common (90%) clinical manifestation.2. Pancreatic islet cells:  Hyperplasia or adenoma seen in 80%\\ncases; frequently with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\\n3. Pituitary:  Hyperplasia or adenoma in 65% cases; manifest\\nas acromegaly or hypopituitarism.\\n4. Adrenal cortex:   Uncommonly involved by adenoma or\\npheochromocytoma.5. Thyroid: Less commonly involved by adenoma or\\nhyperplasia.\\n2.\\nMEN type 2 syndrome (Sipple’s syndrome)  is\\ncharacterised by medullary carcinoma thyroid and\\npheochromocytoma. Genetic abnormality in these cases ismutation in RET  gene in almost all cases. MEN 2 has two\\nmajor syndromes:\\nMEN type 2A  is the combination of medullary carcinoma\\nthyroid, pheochromocytoma and  hyperparathytroidism.MEN type 2A has further three subvariants :\\ni) MEN 2A with familial medullary carcinoma thyroidii) MEN 2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosisiii) MEN 2A with Hirschsprung’s disease.\\nMEN type 2B the combination of medullary carcinoma\\nthyroid, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, intestinalganglioneuromatosis, and marfanoid features.\\n3. Mixed syndromes  include a variety of endocrine\\nneoplastic combinations which are distinct from those in\\nMEN type 1 and type 2. A few examples are as under:\\nvon Hippel-Lindau syndrome from mutation in VHL\\ngene is association of CNS tumours, renal cell carcinoma,pheochromocytoma and islet cell tumours.\\nType 1 neurofibromatosis from inactivation of neurofibro-\\nmin protein and activation of RAS gene, is associated with\\nMEN type 1 or type 2 features.\\nPOLYGLANDULAR AUTOIMMUNE (PGA) SYNDROMES\\nImmunologic syndromes affecting two or more endocrine\\nglands and some non-endocrine immune disturbancesproduce syndromic presentation termed polyglandularautoimmune (PGA) syndromes. PGA syndromes are of twotypes:\\nPGA type I occurring in children is characterised by\\nmucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, andadrenal insufficiency.\\nPGA type II (Schmidt syndrome) presents in adults and\\ncommonly comprises of adrenal insufficiency, autoimmunethyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.\\n❑830SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nThe Musculoskeletal System Chapter 28Chapter 28\\nSKELETAL SYSTEM\\nThe skeleton consists of cartilage and bone. Cartilage has a\\nrole in growth and repair of bone, and in the adults formsthe articular skeleton responsible for movement of joints.Bone is a specialised form of connective tissue whichperforms the function of providing mechanical support andis also a mineral reservoir for calcium homeostasis. Thereare 206 bones in the human body, and depending upon theirsize and shape may be long, flat, tubular etc.\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE OF BONE\\nBone is divided into 2 components (Fig. 28.1):\\nCortical or compact bone  comprises 80% of the skeleton\\nand is the dense outer shell responsible for structural rigidity.\\nIt consists of haversian canals with blood vessels surroundedby concentric layers of mineralised collagen forming osteonswhich are joined together by cement lines.\\nTrabecular or cancellous bone  composes 20% of the\\nskeleton and has trabeculae traversing the marrow space.Its main role is in mineral homeostasis.\\nHISTOLOGY.  Bone consists of large quantities of extra-\\ncellular matrix which is loaded with calcium hydroxyapatite\\nand relatively small number of bone cells which are of 3 maintypes: osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts, besides theground substance, the osteoid matrix.\\n1.Osteoblasts.  Osteoblasts are uninucleate cells found\\nabundantly along the new bone-forming surfaces. They syn-\\nthesise bone matrix. The serum levels of bone-related alka-line phosphatase  (other being hepatic alkaline phosphatase) is\\na marker for osteoblastic activity. Its levels are raised inpuberty during period of active bone growth and inpathologic conditions associated with high osteoblasticactivity such as in fracture repair and Paget’s disease of thebone.\\n2.\\nOsteocytes.  Osteocytes are those osteoblasts which get\\nincorporated into the bone matrix during its synthesis. Osteo-\\ncytes are found within small spaces called lacunae lying inthe bone matrix. The distribution of the osteocytic lacunae isa reliable parameter for distinguishing between woven andlamellar bone.\\nWoven bone  is immature and is rapidly deposited. It\\ncontains large number of closely-packed osteocytes andconsists of irregular interlacing pattern of collagen fibrebundles in bone matrix. Woven bone is seen in foetal lifeand in children under 4 years of age.\\nLamellar bone  differs from woven bone in having smaller\\nand less numerous osteocytes and fine and parallel or\\nlamellar sheets of collagen fibres. Lamellar bone usuallyreplaces woven bone or pre-existing cartilage.\\n3. Osteoclasts.  Osteoclasts are large multinucleate cells of\\nmononuclear-macrophage origin and are responsible for\\nbone resorption. The osteoclastic activity is determined bybone-related serum acid phosphatase  levels (other being\\nprostatic acid phosphatase). Osteoclasts are found along theendosteal surface of the cortical (compact) bone and the\\ntrabeculae of trabecular (cancellous) bone.\\n4. Osteoid matrix.  The osteoid matrix of bone consists of\\n90-95% of collagen type I and comprises nearly half of total\\nFigure 28.1 The normal structure of cortical (compact) bone (A) and trabecular (cancellous) bone (B) in transverse section. The cortical bo ne\\nforming the outer shell shows concentric lamellae along with osteocytic lacunae surrounding central blood vessels, while the trabecular bone\\nforming the marrow space shows trabeculae with osteoclastic activity at the margins.831CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal Systembody’s collagen. Virtually whole of body’s hydroxyproline\\nand hydroxylysine reside in the bone. The architecture of\\nbone collagen reflects the rate of its synthesis and may be\\nwoven or lamellar, as described above.\\nBONE FORMATION AND RESORPTION.  Bone is not a\\nstatic tissue but its formation and resorption are taking place\\nduring period of growth as well as in adult life. Bonedeposition is the result of osteoblasts while bone resorption\\nis the function of osteoclasts. Bone formation may take place\\ndirectly from collagen called membranous ossification  seen in\\ncertain flat bones, or may occur through an intermediate stageof cartilage termed endochondral ossification  found in\\nmetaphysis of long bones. In either case, firstly an uncalcifiedosteoid matrix is formed by osteoblasts which is then\\nmineralised in 12-15 days. This delay in mineralisation results\\nin formation of about 15 μm thick osteoid seams at\\ncalcification fronts (About > 1 μm of matrix osteoid is formed\\ndaily). Uncalcified osteoid appears eosinophilic in H & Estains and does not stain with von Kossa reaction, whilemineralised osteoid is basophilic in appearance and stains\\nblack with von Kossa reaction (a stain for calcium). Areas of\\nactive bone resorption have scalloped edges of bone surfacecalled Howship’s lacunae and contain multinucleatedosteoclasts. In this way, osteoblastic formation andosteoclastic resorption continue to take place into adult lifein a balanced way termed bone modelling.  The important role\\nof vitamin D\\n1, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin in calcium\\nmetabolism has already been discussed on page 248.\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE OF CARTILAGE\\nUnlike bone, the cartilage lacks blood vessels, lymphatics\\nand nerves. It may have focal areas of calcification. Carti-lage consists of 2 components: cartilage matrix andchondrocytes.\\nCartilage matrix.  Like bone, cartilage too consists of organic\\nand inorganic material. Inorganic material of cartilage is\\ncalcium hydroxyapatite similar to that in bone matrix butthe organic material of the cartilage is distinct from the bone.It consists of very high content of water (80%) and remaining20% consists of type II collagen and proteoglycans. Highwater content of cartilage matrix is responsible for functionof articular cartilage and lubrication. Proteoglycans aremacromolecules having proteins complexed withpolysaccharides termed glycosaminoglycans. Cartilageglycosaminoglycans consist of chondroitin sulfate andkeratan sulfate, the former being most abundant comprising55-90% of cartilage matrix varying on the age of the cartilage.\\nChondrocytes. Primitive mesenchymal cells which form bone\\ncells form chondroblasts which give rise to chondrocytes.\\nHowever, calcified cartilage is removed by the osteoclasts.\\nDepending upon location and structural composition,\\ncartilage is of 3 types:\\n1.Hyaline cartilage  is the basic cartilaginous tissue\\ncomprising articular cartilage of joints, cartilage in the growth\\nplates of developing bones, costochondral cartilage, cartilagein the trachea, bronchi and larynx and the nasal cartilage.Hyaline cartilage is the type found in most cartilage-formingtumours and in the fracture callus.\\n2.Fibrocartilage  is a hyaline cartilage that contains more\\nabundant type II collagen fibres. It is found in annulus\\nfibrosus of intervertebral disc, menisci, insertions of jointcapsules, ligament and tendons. Fibrocartilage may also befound in some cartilage-forming tumours and in the fracturecallus.\\n3.Elastic cartilage  is hyaline cartilage that contains abundant\\nelastin. Elastic cartilage is found in the pinna of ears,\\nepiglottis and arytenoid cartilage of the larynx.\\nDiseases of skeletal system include infection (osteo-\\nmyelitis), disordered growth and development (skeletal dys-plasias), metabolic and endocrine derangements, andtumours and tumour-like conditions.\\nOSTEOMYELITIS\\nAn infection of the bone is termed osteomyelitis (myelo =\\nmarrow). A number of systemic infectious diseases mayspread to the bone such as enteric fever, actinomycosis,mycetoma (madura foot), syphilis, tuberculosis andbrucellosis. However, two of the conditions which producesignificant pathologic lesions in the bone, namely pyogenicosteomyelitis and tuberculous osteomyelitis, are describedbelow.\\nPyogenic Osteomyelitis\\nSuppurative osteomyelitis is usually caused by bacterial\\ninfection and rarely by fungi. Pyogenic osteomyelitis byhaematogenous route occurs most commonly in the longbones of infants and young children (5-15 years of age),particularly in the developing countries of the world. In thedeveloped world, however, where institution of antibioticsis early and prompt, haematogenous spread of infection tothe bone is uncommon. In such cases, instead, directextension of infection from the adjacent area, frequentlyinvolving the jaws and skull, is more common mode ofspread. Bacterial osteomyelitis may be a complication at allages in patients with compound fractures, surgicalprocedures involving prosthesis or implants, gangrene of alimb in diabetics, debilitation and immunosuppression.Though any etiologic agent may cause osteomyelitis,Staphylococcus aureus  is implicated in a vast majority of cases.\\nLess frequently, other organisms such as streptococci,Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella  and anaerobes are\\ninvolved. Mixed infections are common in post-traumaticcases of osteomyelitis. There may be transient bacteraemiapreceding the development of osteomyelitis so that bloodcultures may be positive.\\nClinically, the child with acute haematogenous osteo-\\nmyelitis has painful and tender limb. Fever, malaise andleucocytosis generally accompany the bony lesion. Radio-logic examination confirms the bony destruction.\\nOccasionally, osteomyelitis remains undiscovered until\\nit becomes chronic. Draining sinus tracts may form whichmay occasionally be the site for development of squamouscarcinoma. Persistence, neglect and chronicity of osteo-832SECTION III Systemic Pathologymyelitis over a longer period of time may lead to develop-\\nment of amyloidosis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Depending upon the\\nduration, osteomyelitis may be acute, subacute  or chronic.\\nThe basic pathologic changes in any stage of osteomyelitisare: suppuration, ischaemic necrosis, healing by fibrosisand bony repair. The sequence of pathologic changes  is as\\nunder  (Fig. 28.2):\\n1. The infection begins in the metaphyseal end of themarrow cavity  which is largely occupied by pus. At this\\nstage, microscopy reveals congestion, oedema and anexudate of neutrophils .\\n2.The tension in the marrow cavity is increased due to\\npus and results in spread of infection along the marrowcavity, into the endosteum, and into the haversian andVolkmann’s canal, causing periosteitis.\\n3\\n. The infection may reach the subperiosteal space\\nforming subperiosteal abscesses.  It may penetrate through\\nthe cortex creating draining skin sinus tracts (Fig. 28.3).4. Combination of suppuration and impaired bloodsupply to the cortical bone results in erosion, thin -\\nning and infarction necrosis of the cortex calledsequestrum.5.With passage of time, there is formation of new bone\\nbeneath the periosteum present over the infected bone.This forms an encasing sheath around the necrosed boneand is known as involucrum.  Involucrum has irregular\\nsurface and has perforations through which dischargingsinus tracts pass.6.\\nLong continued neo-osteogenesis gives rise to dense\\nsclerotic pattern of osteomyelitis called chronic sclerosing\\nnonsuppurative osteomyelitis of Garré.7. Occasionally, acute osteomyelitis may be contained toa localised area and walled off by fibrous tissue andgranulation tissue. This is termed Brodie’s abscess.\\n8. In vertebral pyogenic osteomyelitis , infection begins from\\nthe disc (discitis) and spreads to involve the vertebralbodies  (Fig. 28.4,A).\\nFigure 28.2 Pathogenesis of pyogenic osteomyelitis. A, The process begins as a focus of microabscess in a vascular loop in the marrow which\\nexpands to stimulate resorption of adjacent bony trabeculae. Simultaneously, there is beginning of reactive woven bone formatio n by the periosteum.\\nB, The abscess expands further causing necrosis of the cortex called sequestrum. The formation of viable new reactive bone surrounding the\\nsequestrum is called involucrum. The extension of infection into the joint space, epiphysis and the skin produces a draining si nus.\\nFigure 28.3 Chronic suppurative osteomyelitis. Histologic appearance shows necrotic bone and extensive purulent inflammatory exudate.833CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal SystemCOMPLICATIONS.  Osteomyelitis may result in the\\nfollowing complications:\\n1. Septicaemia.\\n2. Acute bacterial arthritis.\\n3.\\nPathologic fractures.\\n4. Development of squamous cell carcinoma in long-standing cases.5. Secondary amyloidosis in long-standing cases.6. Vertebral osteomyelitis may cause vertebral collapse withparavertebral abscess, epidural abscess, cord compressionand neurologic deficits.\\nTuberculous Osteomyelitis\\nTuberculous osteomyelitis, though rare in developed\\ncountries, continues to be a common condition in under-developed and developing countries of the world. Thetubercle bacilli, M. tuberculosis,  reach the bone marrow and\\nsynovium most commonly by haematogenous disseminationfrom infection elsewhere, usually from the lungs, andinfrequently by direct extension from the pulmonary orgastrointestinal tuberculosis (page 156). The disease affectsadolescents and young adults more often. Most frequentlyinvolved are the spine and bones of extremities.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The bone lesions in tuber-\\nculosis have the same general histological appearance asin tuberculosis elsewhere and consist of central caseationnecrosis surrounded by tuberculous granulation tissueand fragments of necrotic bone (Fig. 28.5).  The tuberculous\\nlesions appear as a focus of bone destruction and replace-ment of the affected tissue by caseous material andformation of multiple discharging sinuses through the softtissues and skin. Involvement of joint spaces andintervertebral disc are frequent. Tuberculosis of the spine,Pott’s  disease,  often commences in the vertebral body and\\nmay be associated with compression fractures anddestruction of intervertebral discs, producing permanentdamage and paraplegia. Extension of caseous materialalong with pus from the lumbar vertebrae to the sheathsof psoas muscle produces psoas abscess  or lumbar cold\\nabscess  (Fig. 28.4,B).  The cold abscess may burst through\\nthe skin and form sinus. Long-standing cases may developsystemic amyloidosis.\\nAVASCULAR NECROSIS (OSTEONECROSIS)\\nAvascular necrosis of the bones or osteonecrosis results from\\nischaemia. It is a relatively common condition.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  It may occur from following\\ncauses:\\n1.Fracture or dislocation\\n2.Sickle cell disease\\n3.\\nCorticosteroid administration\\n4. Radiation therapy5. Chronic alcoholism6. Idiopathic\\nThe pathogenetic mechanism of osteonecrosis in many\\ncases remains obscure, while in others it is by interruptionin the blood supply to the bones induced by direct trauma,compression, or thromboembolic obstruction.\\nFigure 28.4 Osteomyelitis of the vertebral body.\\nFigure 28.5 Tuberculous osteomyelitis. There are epithelioid cell\\ngranulomas with minute areas of caseation necrosis and surrounded by\\nLanghans’ giant cells. Pieces of necrotic bone are also seen.834SECTION III Systemic PathologyMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  There are pathological\\nfractures of the involved bone due to infarcts. Most\\ncommon sites are the ones where the disruption in bloodsupply is at end-arterial circulation. The infarcts mainlyinvolve the medulla of the long bone in the diaphysis. Thisis because the nutrient arteries supply blood to sinusoidsof the medulla and the inner cortex after penetrating thecortex, while the cortex is relatively unaffected due tocollateral circulation.Grossly, the lesional area shows a wedge-shaped area ofinfarction in the subchondral bone under the convexsurface of the joint.Microscopically, the infracted medulla shows saponifiedmarrow fat. The overlying cartilage and the cortex of thelong bones are relatively unaffected.\\nLongterm sequelae of osteonecrosis include occurrence\\nof malignant tumours in this location such as osteosarcoma,malignant fibrous histiocytoma and fibrosarcoma etc.\\nFRACTURE HEALING\\nFracture of the bone initiates a series of tissue changes which\\neventually lead to restoration of normal structure andfunction of the affected bone. Fracture of a bone is commonlyassociated with injury to the soft tissues. The various typesof fractures and their mechanism of healing are discussedalong with healing of specialised tissues in Chapter 6(page 171).\\nDISORDERS OF BONE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT\\n(SKELET AL\\n DYSPLASIAS)\\nA number of abnormalities of the skeleton are due to dis-ordered bone growth and development and are collectivelytermed skeletal dysplasias.  These include both local and\\nsystemic disorders.\\nLocal defects  involve a single bone or a group of bones\\nsuch as: absence or presence in diminished form, fused withneighbouring bones (e.g. syndactyly), and formation of extrabones (e.g. supernumerary ribs).\\nHowever, more importantly, skeletal dysplasias include\\nsystemic disorders  involving particular epiphyseal growth\\nplate. These include: achondroplasia (disorder ofchondroblasts), osteogenesis imperfecta (disorder ofosteoblasts), osteopetrosis (disorder of osteoclasts) and foetalrickets (disorder of mineralisation). Though multipleexostoses (osteochondromas) is a hereditary lesion, it isdescribed later along with solitary sporadic exostosis on page843.\\nAchondroplasia\\nAchondroplasia is an autosomal dominant genetic abnor-\\nmality. There is selective interference with normal endo-chondral ossification at the level of epiphyseal cartilaginousgrowth plates of long bones. Thus, the long bones areabnormally short but the skull grows normally leading torelatively large skull. Achondroplasia is the commonestcause of dwarfism.Osteogenesis Imperfecta\\nOsteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant or reces-\\nsive disorder of synthesis of type I collagen that constitutes90-95% of bone matrix. The disorder, thus, involves not onlythe skeleton but other extra-skeletal tissues as wellcontaining type I collagen such as sclera, eyes, joints,ligaments, teeth and skin. The skeletal manifestations ofosteogenesis imperfecta are due to defective osteoblastswhich normally synthesise type I collagen. This results inthin or non-existent cortices and irregular trabeculae (too\\nlittle bone)  so that the bones are very fragile and liable to\\nmultiple fractures. The growth plate cartilage is, however,normal. The condition may be evident at birth (osteogenesisimperfecta congenita) when it is more severe, or may appearduring adolescence (osteogenesis imperfecta tarda) whichis a less incapacitating form. Extraskeletal lesions of osteo-genesis imperfecta include blue and translucent sclerae,hearing loss due to bony abnormalities of the middle and\\ninner ear, and imperfect teeth.\\nOsteopetrosis\\nOsteopetrosis, also called marble bone disease,  is an autosomal\\ndominant or recessive disorder of increased skeletal mass or\\nosteosclerosis caused by a hereditary defect in osteoclastfunction. The condition may appear in 2 forms: autosomal\\nrecessive (malignant infantile form) and autosomal dominant(benign adult form). Failure of normal osteoclast function ofbone resorption coupled with continued bone formation andendochondral ossification results in net overgrowth ofcalcified dense bone (too much bone)  which occupies most of\\nthe available marrow space. Despite increased density of thebone, there is poor structural support so that the skeleton issusceptible to fractures. Besides the skeletal abnormalities,the infantile malignant form is characterised by effects ofmarrow obliteration such as anaemia, neutropenia, thrombo-cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly with extramedullaryhaematopoiesis, hydrocephalus and neurologic involvementwith consequent deafness, optic atrophy and blindness.Metabolically, hypocalcaemia occurs due to defectiveosteoclast function.\\nHistologically,  the number of osteoclasts is increased\\nwhich have dysplastic, bizarre and irregular nuclei andare dysfunctional.\\nMETABOLIC \\nAND ENDOCRINE BONE DISEASES\\nA large number of metabolic and endocrine disordersproduce generalised skeletal disorders. These include thefollowing:\\n1.Osteoporosis —Resulting from quantitative reduction in\\notherwise normal bone.2.Osteomalacia and rickets —Characterised by qualitative\\nabnormality in the form of impaired bone mineralisation due\\nto deficiency of vitamin D in adults and children respectively(page 249).\\n3.\\nScurvy —Caused by deficiency of vitamin C resulting in\\nsubperiosteal haemorrhages (page 251).835CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal System4. Hyperparathyroidism —Leading to osteitis fibrosa\\ncystica (page 816).\\n5. Pituitary dysfunctions —Hyperpituitarism causing\\ngigantism and acromegaly and hypopituitarism resulting in\\ndwarfism (page 793).\\n6. Thyroid dysfunctions —Hyperthyroidism causing\\nosteoporosis and hypothyroidism leading to cretinism (page\\n802).\\n7. Renal osteodystrophy —Occurring in chronic renal\\nfailure and resulting in features of osteitis fibrosa cystica,\\nosteomalacia and areas of osteosclerosis.\\n8. Skeletal fluorosis —Occurring due to excess of sodium\\nfluoride content in the soil and water in an area.\\nMany of the conditions listed above have been discussed\\nin respective chapters already; others are considered below.\\nOsteoporosis\\nOsteoporosis or osteopenia is a common clinical syndrome\\ninvolving multiple bones in which there is quantitativereduction of bone tissue mass but the bone tissue mass isotherwise normal. This reduction in bone mass results infragile skeleton which is associated with increased risk offractures and consequent pain and deformity. The conditionis particularly common in elderly people and more frequentin postmenopausal women. The condition may remainasymptomatic or may cause only backache. However, moreextensive involvement is associated with fractures,particularly of distal radius, femoral neck and vertebralbodies. Osteoporosis may be difficult to distinguish radio-logically from other osteopenias such as osteomalacia,osteogenesis imperfecta, osteitis fibrosa of hyperpara-thyroidism, renal osteodystrophy and multiple myeloma.Radiologic evidence becomes apparent only after more than30% of bone mass has been lost. Levels of serum calcium,inorganic phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase are usuallywithin normal limits.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  Osteoporosis is conventionally classified\\ninto 2 major groups: primary and secondary.\\nPrimary osteoporosis  results primarily from osteopenia\\nwithout an underlying disease or medication. Primary\\nosteoporosis is further subdivided into 2 types: idiopathic type\\nfound in the young and juveniles and is less frequent, andinvolutional type  seen in postmenopausal women and aging\\nindividuals and is more common. The exact mechanism ofprimary osteoporosis is not known but there is a suggestionthat it is the result of an excessive osteoclastic resorption andslow bone formation. A number of risk factors have beenattributed to cause this imbalance between bone resorptionand bone formation. These include the following:\\n1.Genetic factors —more marked in whites and Asians than\\nblacks.2.Sex—more frequent in females than in males.\\n3.Reduced physical activity —as in old age.\\n4.Deficiency of sex hormones —oestrogen deficiency in women\\nas in postmenopausal osteoporosis and androgen deficiency\\nin men.\\n5.Combined deficiency of calcitonin and oestrogen.6.Hyperparathyroidism.\\n7.Deficiency of vitamin D.\\n8.Local factors —which may stimulate osteoclastic resorption\\nor slow osteoblastic bone formation.\\nSecondary osteoporosis  is attributed to a number of\\nfactors and conditions (e.g. immobilisation, chronic anaemia,\\nacromegaly, hepatic disease, hyperparathyroidism,hypogonadism, thyrotoxicosis and starvation), or as an effectof medication (e.g. hypercortisonism, administration ofanticonvulsant drugs and large dose of heparin).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Except disuse or immobi-\\nlisation osteoporosis which is localised to the affected limb,other forms of osteoporosis have systemic skeletaldistribution. Most commonly encountered osteoporoticfractures are: vertebral crush fracture, femoral neckfracture and wrist fracture. There is enlargement of themedullary cavity and thinning of the cortex.Histologically,  osteoporosis may be active or inactive\\ntype.\\nActive osteoporosis  is characterised by increased bone\\nresorption and formation i.e. accelerated turnover.  There is\\nincrease in the number of osteoclasts with increasedresorptive surface as well as increased quantity of osteoidwith increased osteoblastic surfaces. The width of osteoidseams is normal.\\nInactive osteoporosis  has the features of minimal bone\\nformation and reduced resorptive activity i.e. reduced\\nturnover.  Histological changes of inactive osteoporosis\\ninclude decreased number of osteoclasts with decreasedresorptive surfaces, and normal or reduced amount ofosteoid with decreased osteoblastic surface. The width ofosteoid seams is usually reduced or may be normal.\\nOsteitis Fibrosa Cystica\\nHyperparathyroidism of primary or secondary type results\\nin oversecretion of parathyroid hormone which causes\\nincreased osteoclastic resorption of the bone. General aspectsof hyperparathyroidism are discussed on page 816. Here,skeletal manifestations of hyperparathyroidism areconsidered. Severe and prolonged hyperparathyroidismresults in osteitis fibrosa cystica. The lesion is generallyinduced as a manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism,and less frequently, as a result of secondary hyperpara-thyroidism such as in chronic renal failure (renalosteodystrophy).\\nThe clinical manifestations of bone disease in hyper-\\nparathyroidism are its susceptibility to fracture, skeletaldeformities, joint pains and dysfunctions as a result of deran-ged weight bearing. The bony changes may disappear aftercure of primary hyperparathyroidism such as removal offunctioning adenoma. The chief biochemical abnormality ofexcessive parathyroid hormone is hypercalcaemia,hypophosphataemia and hypercalciuria.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The bone lesions of\\nprimary hyperparathyroidism affect the long bones moreseverely and may range from minor degree of generalised836SECTION III Systemic Pathologybone rarefaction to prominent areas of bone destruction\\nwith cyst formation or brown tumours.Grossly,  there are focal areas of erosion of cortical bone\\nand loss of lamina dura at the roots of teeth.Histologically,  the following sequential changes appear\\nover a period of time:\\nEarliest change is demineralisation  and increased bone\\nresorption  beginning at the subperiosteal and endosteal\\nsurface of the cortex and then spreading to the trabecularbone.\\nThere is replacement of bone and bone marrow by\\nfibrosis coupled with increased number of bizarreosteoclasts at the surfaces of moth-eaten trabeculae andcortex (osteitis fibrosa).\\nAs a result of increased resorption, microfractures and\\nmicrohaemorrhages occur in the marrow cavity leadingto development of cysts (osteitis fibrosa cystica).\\nHaemosiderin-laden macrophages and multinucleate\\ngiant cells appear at the areas of haemorrhages producingan appearance termed as ‘brown  tumour’  or ‘reparative giant\\ncell granuloma of hyperparathyroidism’  requiring\\ndifferentiation from giant cell tumour or osteoclastoma(page 846). However, the so-called brown tumours, unlikeosteoclastoma, are not true tumours but instead regressor disappear on surgical removal of hyperplastic oradenomatous parathyroid tissue.\\nRenal Osteodystrophy (Metabolic Bone Disease)\\nRenal osteodystrophy is a loosely used term that encom-\\npasses a number of skeletal abnormalities appearing in casesof chronic renal failure and in patients treated by dialysis forseveral years (page 656). Renal osteodystrophy is morecommon in children than in adults. Clinical symptoms ofbone disease in advanced renal failure appear in less than10% of patients but radiologic and histologic changes areobserved in fairly large proportion of cases.PATHOGENESIS.  Renal osteodystrophy involves two\\nmain events: hyperphosphataemia and hypocalcaemia  which,\\nin turn, leads to parathormone elaboration and resultantosteoclastic activity and major lesions of renal osteo-dystrophy—osteomalacia (rickets in children), secondaryhyperparathyroidism, osteitis fibrosa cystica, osteosclerosisand metastatic calcification.\\nThe mechanisms underlying renal osteodystrophy are\\nschematically illustrated in Fig. 28.6  and briefly outlined\\nbelow:\\n1.Hyperphosphataemia:  In CRF, there is impaired renal\\nexcretion of phosphate, causing phosphate retention and\\nhyperphosphataemia. Hyperphosphataemia, in turn, causeshypocalcaemia which is responsible for secondaryhyperparathyroidism.\\n2.\\nHypocalcaemia:  Hypocalcaemia may also result from the\\nfollowing:\\nDue to renal dysfunction, there is decreased conversion\\nof vitamin D metabolite 25(OH) cholecalciferol to its active\\nform 1,25 (OH)2 cholecalciferol.\\nReduced intestinal absorption of calcium.\\n3. Parathormone secretion:  Hypocalcaemia stimulates\\nsecretion of parathormone, eventually leading to secondaryhyperparathyroidism which, in turn, causes increasedosteoclastic activity.\\n4. Metabolic acidosis:  As a result of decreased renal\\nfunction, acidosis sets in which may cause osteoporosis and\\nbone decalcification.\\n5. Calcium phosphorus product  > 70:  When the product of\\nbiochemical value of calcium and phosphate is higher than\\n70, metastatic calcification may occur at extraosseous sites.\\n6. Dialysis-related metabolic bone disease: Long-term dia-\\nlysis employing use of aluminium-containing dialysate iscurrently considered to be a major cause of metabolic bonelesions. Aluminium interferes with deposition of calcium\\nFigure 28.6 Pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy in chronic renal failure. Circled serial numbers in the graphic representation correspond to\\nthe sequence described in the text under pathogenesis.837CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal Systemhydroxyapatite in bone and results in osteomalacia,\\nsecondary hyperparathyroidism and osteitis fibrosa cystica.In addition, accumulation of β\\n2-microglobulin amyloid in\\nsuch cases causes dialysis-related amyloidosis (page 86).\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The following skeletal\\nlesions can be identified in renal osteodystrophy:1.Mixed osteomalacia-osteitis fibrosa  is the most common\\nmanifestation of renal osteodystrophy resulting fromdisordered vitamin D metabolism and secondaryhyperparathyroidism.2.Pure osteitis fibrosa  results from metabolic compli-\\ncations of secondary hyperparathyroidism.3.Pure osteomalacia  of renal osteodystrophy is attributed\\nto aluminium toxicity.4.Renal rickets  resembling the changes seen in children\\nwith nutritional rickets with widened osteoid seams mayoccur (page 249).5.Osteosclerosis  is characterised by enhanced bone\\ndensity in the upper and lower margins of vertebrae.6.Metastatic calcification is seen at extraosseous sites such\\nas in medium-sized blood vessels, periarticular tissues,myocardium, eyes, lungs and gastric mucosa (page 53).\\nSkeletal Fluorosis\\nFluorosis of bones occurs due to high sodium fluoride\\ncontent in soil and water consumed by people in somegeographic areas and is termed endemic fluorosis. Suchendemic regions exist in some tropical and subtropicalareas; in India it exists in parts of Punjab and AndhraPradesh. The condition affects farmers who consumedrinking water from wells. Non-endemic fluorosis resultsfrom occupational exposure in manufacturing industries ofaluminium, magnesium, and superphosphate.\\nPATHOGENESIS. In fluorosis, fluoride replaces calcium as\\nthe mineral in the bone and gets deposited without any\\nregulatory control. This results in heavily mineralised boneswhich are thicker and denser but are otherwise weak anddeformed (just as in osteopetrosis). In addition, there are alsodeposits of fluoride in soft tissues, particularly as nodules inthe interosseous membrane. The patient develops skeletaldeformities and mottling of teeth.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the long bones\\nand vertebrae develop nodular swellings which arepresent both inside the bones and on the surface.\\nMicroscopically,  these nodules are composed of heavily\\nmineralised irregular osteoid admixed with fluoride which\\nrequires confirmation chemically.\\nPAGET’S DISEASE OF BONE (OSTEITIS DEFORMANS)\\nPaget’s disease of bone* or osteitis deformans was first\\ndescribed by Sir James Paget in 1877. Paget’s disease of boneis an osteolytic and osteosclerotic bone disease of uncertainetiology involving one (monostotic) or more bones(polyostotic). The condition affects predominantly males overthe age of 50 years. Though the etiology remains obscure,following factors have been implicated:1. There has been some evidence that osteitis deformans is aform of slow-virus infection  by paramyxovirus (e.g. respiratory\\nsyncytial virus, measles) in osteoclasts. However, the virushas not been cultured from the osteoclasts of Paget’s disease.2. Autosomal dominant inheritance and genetic susceptibility\\nhave been proposed on the basis of observation of 7-10 foldhigher prevalence of disease in first-degree relatives. Thesusceptibility gene located on chromosome 18q encodes fora member of tumour necrosis factor called RANK (receptoractivator of nuclear factor: κB).\\nClinically, the monostotic form  of the disease may remain\\nasymptomatic and the lesion is discovered incidentally oron radiologic examination. Polyostotic form,  however, is more\\nwidespread and may produce pain, fractures, skeletaldeformities, and occasionally, sarcomatous transformation.Typically, there is marked elevation of serum alkalinephosphatase and normal to high serum calcium level.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Monostotic Paget’sdisease involves most frequently: tibia, pelvis, femur, skulland vertebra, while the order of involvement in polyostoticPaget’s disease is: vertebrae, pelvis, femur, skull, sacrumand tibia. Three sequential stages are identified in Paget’sdisease:1.Initial osteolytic stage:  This stage is characterised by\\nareas of osteoclastic resorption produced by increasednumber of large osteoclasts.2.\\nMixed osteolytic-osteoblastic stage:  In this stage,\\nthere is imbalance between osteoblastic laying down ofnew bone and osteoclastic resorption so thatmineralisation of the newly-laid matrix lags behind,resulting in development of characteristic mosaic pattern\\nor jigsaw puzzle appearance  of osteoid seams or cement lines.\\nThe narrow space between the trabeculae and cortex isfilled with collagen which gradually becomes lessvascular.3. Quiscent osteosclerotic  stage:  After many years,\\nexcessive bone formation results so that the bone becomesmore compact and dense producing osteosclerosis.However, newly-formed bone is poorly mineralised, softand susceptible to fractures. Radiologically, this stageproduces characteristic cotton-wool appearance  of the\\naffected bone.\\nTUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS OF BONE\\nIn the context of bones, several non-neoplastic conditions\\nresemble true neoplasms and have to be distinguished fromthem clinically, radiologically and morphologically.Table 28.1 gives a list of such tumour-like lesions. A few\\ncommon conditions are described below.\\nFibrous Dysplasia\\nFibrous dysplasia is not an uncommon tumour-like lesion\\nof the bone. It is a benign condition, possibly of develop-mental origin, characterised by the presence of localised area\\n*It is pertinent to recall here that James Paget described Paget’s disease\\nat three different anatomic sites which are not mutually interlinked in\\nany way: Paget’s disease of nipple (page 764), Paget’s disease of vulva(page 722) and Paget’s disease of bone.838SECTION III Systemic Pathologyof replacement of bone by fibrous connective tissue with a\\ncharacteristic whorled pattern and containing trabeculae ofwoven bone. Radiologically, the typical focus of fibrousdysplasia has well-demarcated ground-glass appearance.\\nThree types of fibrous dysplasia are distinguished—\\nmonostotic, polyostotic, and Albright syndrome. Thespectrum of phenotype of the disease is due to activatingmutation in GNAS1  gene, which encodes for α-subunits of\\nthe stimulatory G-protein, G\\nSα.\\nMonostotic fibrous dysplasia.  Monostotic fibrous\\ndysplasia affects a solitary bone and is the most commontype, comprising about 70% of all cases. The condition affectseither sex and most patients are between 20 and 30 years ofage. The bones most often affected, in descending order offrequency, are: ribs, craniofacial bones (especially maxilla),femur, tibia and humerus. The condition generally remainsasymptomatic and is discovered incidentally, butinfrequently may produce tumour-like enlargement of theaffected bone.\\nPolyostotic fibrous dysplasia.  Polyostotic form of fibrous\\ndysplasia affecting several bones constitutes about 25% ofall cases. Both sexes are affected equally but the lesionsappear at a relatively earlier age than the monostotic form.Most frequently affected bones are: craniofacial, ribs,vertebrae and long bones of the limbs. Approximately aquarter of cases with polyostotic form have more than halfof the skeleton involved by disease. The lesions may affectone side of the body or may be distributed segmentally in alimb. Spontaneous fractures and skeletal deformities occurin childhood polyostotic form of the disease.\\nAlbright syndrome.  Also called McCune-Albright\\nsyndrome, this is a form of polyostotic fibrous dysplasiaassociated with endocrine dysfunctions and accounts for lessthan 5% of all cases. Unlike monostotic and polyostoticvarieties, Albright syndrome is more common in females.The syndrome is characterised by polyostotic bone lesions,skin pigmentation (cafe-au-lait  macular spots) and sexual\\nprecocity, and infrequently other endocrinopathies.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  All forms of fibrous dys-\\nplasia have an identical pathologic appearance.Grossly,  the lesions appear as sharply-demarcated,\\nlocalised defects measuring 2-5 cm in diameter, presentwithin the cancellous bone, having thin and smoothoverlying cortex. The epiphyseal cartilages are generallyspared in the monostotic form but involved in thepolyostotic form of disease. Cut section of the lesion showsreplacement of normal cancellous bone of the marrowcavity by gritty, grey-pink, rubbery soft tissue which mayhave areas of haemorrhages, myxoid change and cystformation.\\nHistologically,  the lesions of fibrous dysplasia have\\ncharacteristic benign-looking fibroblastic tissue arranged\\nin a loose, whorled pattern in which there are irregularand curved trabeculae of woven (non-lamellar) bone inthe form fish-hook appearance or Chinese letter shapes.Characteristically, there are no osteoblasts rimming thentrabeculae of the bone, suggesting a maturation defect inthe bone (Fig. 28.7) . Rarely, malignant change may occur\\nin fibrous dysplasia, most often an osteogenic sarcoma.\\nFibrous Cortical Defect (MetaphysealFibrous Defect, Non-ossifying Fibroma)\\nFibrous cortical defect or metaphyseal fibrous defect is a\\nrather common benign tumour-like lesion occurring in themetaphyseal cortex of long bones in children. Mostcommonly involved bones are upper or lower end of tibia orlower end of femur. The lesion is generally solitary but rarelythere may be multiple and bilaterally symmetrical defects.Radiologically, the lesion is eccentrically located in themetaphysis and has a sharply-delimited border. Thepathogenesis of fibrous cortical defect is unk nown. Possibly,\\nit arises as a result of some developmental defect at theepiphyseal plate, or could be a tumour of histiocytic originbecause of close resemblance to fibrohistiocytic tumours(page 864).\\nClinically, fibrous cortical defect causes no symptoms and\\nis usually discovered accidentally when X-ray of the regionis done for some other reason.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the lesion is\\ngenerally small, less than 4 cm in diameter, granular andbrown. Larger lesion (5-10 cm) occurring usually inresponse to trauma is referred to as non-ossifying fibroma .\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 28.1: Classification of Tumour-like Lesions  of Bone.\\n1.

The bony trabeculae\\nhave fish-hook appearance (or Chinese-letter appearance) surrounded\\nby fibrous tissue. The osteoblastic rimming of the bony trabeculae arecharacteristically absent.839CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal SystemMicroscopically, fibrous cortical defect consists of cellular\\nmasses of fibrous tissue showing storiform pattern. Thereare numerous multinucleate osteoclast-like giant cells,haemosiderin-laden macrophages and foamy cells; hencethe lesion is also termed histiocytic xanthogranuloma orfibrous xanthoma of bone.\\nSolitary (Simple, Unicameral) Bone Cyst\\nSolitary, simple or unicameral bone cyst is a benign condition\\noccurring in children and adolescents, most frequentlylocated in the metaphyses at the upper end of humerus andfemur. The cyst expands the bone causing thinning of theoverlying cortex. Possibly, the lesion arises due to localdisorder of bone growth and development. Clinically, solitarybone cyst may remain asymptomatic or may cause pain andfracture.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  simple cyst of the\\nbone is generally unilocular with smooth inner surface.The cavity is filled with clear fluid.Histologically,  the cyst wall consists of thin collagenous\\ntissue having scattered osteoclast giant cells and newlyformed reactive bony trabeculae. Fracture alters theappearance and produces sanguineous fluid in the cavity,and haemorrhages, haemosiderin deposits andmacrophages in the cyst wall.\\nAneurysmal Bone Cyst\\nAneurysmal bone cyst, true to its name, is an expanding\\nosteolytic lesion filled with blood (aneurysm = dilatation,\\ndistension). The condition is seen more commonly in youngpatients under 30 years of age. Most frequently involvedbones are shafts of metaphyses of long bones or the vertebralcolumn. The radiographic appearance shows characteristicballooned-out expansile lesion underneath the periosteum.The pathogenesis is not clear but it has been suggested bysome authors that the condition probably arises frompersistent local alteration in haemodynamics. Clinically, theaneurysmal bone cyst may enlarge over a period of yearsand produce pain, tenderness and pathologic fracture.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the lesion\\nconsists of a large haemorrhagic mass covered over bythinned out reactive bone (Fig. 28.8).\\nHistologically,  the cyst consists of blood-filled aneurys-\\nmal spaces of variable size, some of which are endo-thelium-lined. The spaces are separated by connectivetissue septa containing osteoid tissue, numerousosteoclast-like multinucleate giant cells and trabeculae ofbone (Fig. 28.9) . The condition has to be distinguished\\nhistologically from giant cell tumour or osteoclastoma(page 846) and telangiectatic osteosarcoma (page 842).\\nBONE  TUMOURS\\nBone tumours are comparatively infrequent but they are\\nclinically quite significant since some of them are highlymalignant. Bone tumours may be primary or metastatic. Sincehistogenesis of some bone tumours is obscure, the WHO hasrecommended a widely accepted classification of primarybone tumours based on both histogenesis and histologiccriteria. Table 28.2 lists the various types of bone tumours\\narising from different tissue components—osseous and non-osseous, indigenous to the bone. However, in the discussionbelow, only osseous bone tumours are considered, while non-osseous bone tumours are described elsewhere in the book.\\nFigure 28.8 Aneurysmal bone cyst, ulna. The end of the long bone\\nis expanded due to a cyst. The inner wall of the cyst is tan and\\nhaemorrhagic.840SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nFigure 28.10 Anatomic locations of common primary bone tumours.The anatomic origin of common primary bone tumours is\\nillustrated in Fig. 28.10.\\nIt may be mentioned here that the diagnosis of any bone\\nlesion is established by a combination of clinical, radiologicaland pathological examination, supplemented by biochemicaland haematological investigations wherever necessary. Theseinclude: serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkalinephosphatase and acid phosphatase. Specific investigationslike plasma and urinary proteins and the bone marrow\\nexamination in case of myeloma, urinary catecholamines in\\nmetastatic neuroblastoma and haematologic profile inlymphoma and leukaemic involvement of the bone, are ofconsiderable help.\\nBONE-FORMING (OSTEOBLASTIC) TUMOURS\\nBone-forming or osteoblastic group of bone tumours are\\ncharacterised by the common property of synthesis of osteoidor bone, or both, directly by the tumour cells (osteogenesis).\\nFormation of reactive bone and endochondral ossificationshould not be construed as osteogenesis. Benign bone-\\nforming tumours include: osteoma, osteoid osteoma and\\nosteoblastoma, while the malignant counterpart is osteo-sarcoma (osteogenic sarcoma).\\nOsteoma\\nAn osteoma is a rare benign, slow-growing lesion, regarded\\nby some as a hamartoma rather than a true neoplasm. Similarlesions may occur following trauma, subperiosteal\\nhaematoma or local inflammation. Osteoma is almost\\nexclusively restricted to flat bones of the skull and face. Itmay grow into paranasal sinuses or protrude into the orbit.An osteoma may form a component of Gardner’s syndrome(page 585). Radiologic appearance is of a dense ivory-likebony mass.\\nMicroscopically,  the lesion is composed of well-differen-\\ntiated mature lamellar bony trabeculae separated byfibrovascular tissue.Osteoid Osteoma and Osteoblastoma\\nOsteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma (or giant osteoid\\nosteoma) are closely related benign tumours occurring inchildren and young adults. Osteoid osteoma is more commonthan osteoblastoma. There are no clear-cut histologic criteriato distinguish the two. The distinction between them is basedon clinical features, size and radiographic appearance.\\nOsteoid osteoma  is small (usually less than 1 cm) and\\npainful tumour, located in the cortex of a long bone. The\\ntumour is clearly demarcated having surrounding zone of\\nreactive bone formation which radiographically appears as\\nFigure 28.9 Aneurysmal bone cyst. Histologic hallmark of lesion is presence of aneurysmal spaces filled with blood, partly lined by endothe lium\\nand separated by connective tissue septa containing osteoclast-like giant cells along the wall of vascular spaces.841CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal Systema small radiolucent central focus or nidus surrounded by\\ndense sclerotic bone.\\nOsteoblastoma,  on the other hand, is larger in size\\n(usually more than 1 cm), painless, located in the medulla,\\ncommonly in the vertebrae, ribs, ilium and long bones, and\\nthere is absence of reactive bone formation.\\nHistologically,  the distinction between osteoid osteoma\\nand osteoblastoma is not obvious. In either case, the lesion\\nconsists of trabeculae of osteoid, rimmed by osteoblasts\\nand separated by highly vascularised connective tissuestroma. Later, some of the trabeculae are mineralised and\\ncalcified.\\nOsteosarcoma\\nOsteosarcoma or osteogenic sarcoma is the most common\\npri\\nmary malignant tumour of the bone. The tumour is\\ncharacterised by formation of  osteoid or bone, or both, directly by\\nsarcoma cells.  The tumour is thought to arise from primitive\\nosteoblast-forming mesenchyme. Depending upon theirlocations within the bone, osteosarcomas are classified into2 main categories: central (medullary) and surface ( parostealand perosteal).\\nCENTRAL (MEDULLARY) OSTEOSARCOMA\\nThis is the more common and classic type and is generally\\nreferred to as ‘osteosarcoma’ if not specified. The tumouroccurs in young patients between the age of 10 and 20 years.Males are affected more frequently than females. Thetumour arises in the metaphysis of long bones. Mostcommon sites, in descending order of frequency, are: thelower end of femur and upper end of tibia (i.e. around kneejoint about 60%); the upper end of humerus (10%); pelvisand the upper end of femur (i.e. around hip joint about 15%);and less often in jaw bones, vertebrae and skull. Rarely, anosteosarcoma may occur in extraskeletal soft tissues.\\nBased upon the pathogenesis, osteosarcoma is divided\\ninto 2 types: primary and secondary.\\nPrimary osteosarcoma  is more common and occurs in the\\nabsence of any known underlying disease. Its etiology isunknown but there is evidence linking this form ofosteosarcoma with genetic factors (e.g. hereditary mutationof chromosome 13 in common with retinoblastoma locus),period of active bone growth (occurrence of the tumour inyounger age), and with certain environmental influences(e.g. radiation, oncogenic virus). Cases of hereditary retino-blastoma have a very high prevalence risk of developmentof osteosarcoma implicating RB gene in their pathogenesis.\\nAbout 20% sporadic osteosarcomas show mutation in p53\\ntumour suppressor gene; some have overexpression ofMDM2  gene and mutation in cyclin D1, p16  and CDK4.\\nSecondary osteosarcoma,  on the other hand, develops\\nfollowing pre-existing bone disease e.g. Paget’s disease ofbone, fibrous dysplasia, multiple osteochondromas, chronicosteomyelitis, infarcts and fractures of bone. The tumourhas a more aggressive behaviour than the primaryosteosarcoma.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 28.2: Classification of Primary Bone Tumours.\\nHistologic Derivation Benign Malignant\\nA.

If the periosteum is breached, the\\ntumour grows relentlessly into the surrounding soft tissues.\\nThe only tissue which is able to stop its spread, albeittemporarily, is the cartilage of epiphyseal plate. The\\nradiographic appearance is quite distinctive: characteristic\\n‘sunburst pattern’  due to osteogenesis within the tumour and\\npresence of Codman’s triangle  formed at the angle between\\nthe elevated periosteum and underlying surface of the cortex.\\nClinically, the usual osteosarcoma presents with pain,\\ntenderness and an obvious swelling of affected extremity.\\nSerum alkaline phosphatase level is generally raised but\\ncalcium and phosphorus levels are normal. The tumourmetastasises rapidly and widely to distant sites by\\nhaematogenous route and disseminates commonly to thelungs, other bones, brain and various other sites.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour\\nappears as a grey-white, bulky mass at the metaphysealend of a long bone of the extremity. The articular end ofthe bone is generally uninvolved in initial stage. Codman’striangle, though identified radiologically, may be obviouson macroscopic examination  (Fig. 28.11).  Cut surface of\\nthe tumour is grey-white with areas of haemorrhages andnecrotic bone. Tumours which form abundance of osteoid,bone and cartilage may have hard, gritty and mucoidareas.\\nHistologically,  osteosarcoma shows considerable\\nvariation in pattern from case-to-case and even within atumour from one area to the other. However, the following\\ntwo features characterise all classic forms of osteosarcomas(Fig. 28.12):\\n1. Sarcoma cells.  The tumour cells of osteosarcomas are\\nundifferentiated mesenchymal stromal cells which show\\nmarked pleomorphism and polymorphism i.e. variationin size as well as shape. The tumour cells may have variousshapes such as spindled, round, oval and polygonal andbizarre tumour giant cells. The tumour cells have variablesize and show hyperchromatism and atypical mitoses.Histochemically, these tumour cells are positive foralkaline phosphatase. Immunohistochemically, sarcomacells of osteosarcoma express vimentin, osteocalcin,osteonectin and type I collagen.\\n2.Osteogenesis.  The anaplastic sarcoma cells form\\nosteoid matrix and bone directly; this is found interspersed\\nin the areas of tumour cells. In addition to osteoid andbone, the tumour cells may produce cartilage, fibroustissue or myxoid tissue.\\nA few histologic variants of the usual osteosarcoma have\\nbeen described as under:\\nTelangiectatic osteosarcoma.  The tumour in this variant\\npresents with pathological fractures. The tumour has large,cavernous, dilated vascular channels. This variant has a moreaggrieve course.\\nSmall cell osteosarcoma.  This variant has small, uniform\\ntumour cells just like the tumour cells of Ewing’s sarcoma orlymphoma but osteogensis by these tumour cells is thedistinguishing feature.\\nFibrohistiocytic osteosarcoma.  This variant resembles\\nmalignant fibrous histiocytoma but having osteogenesis bythe tumour cells.\\nFigure 28.11 Osteosarcoma. The lower end of the femur shows a\\nbulky expanded tumour in the region of metaphysis sparing the epiphyseal\\ncartilage. Sectioned surface of the tumour shows lifting of the periosteumby the tumour and eroded cortical bone. The tumour is grey-white with\\nareas of haemorrhage and necrosis.843CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal SystemAnaplastic osteosarcoma.  In this variant, the tumour has so\\nmarked anaplasia that it may resemble any other type of\\npleomorphic sarcoma and is identified by the presence ofosteoid formed directly by the tumour cells.\\nWell-differentiated  osteosarcoma.  Although generally classic\\nform of osteosarcoma is a highly malignant tumour, rarely awell-differentiated variant having minimal cytologic atypiaresembling parosteal osteosarcoma may be seen.\\nSURFACE OSTEOSARCOMA\\nAbout 5% of osteosarcomas occur on the surface of bone and\\nare slow-growing tumours compared to medullaryosteosarcomas. Surface osteosarcoma includes 2 variants:parosteal and periosteal.\\nParosteal or juxtacortical osteosarcoma  is an uncommon\\nform of osteosarcoma having its origin from the metaphysis\\non the external surface of the bone ( parosteal  or juxtacortical\\nmeans outer to cortex). The tumour should be distinguishedfrom the more common medullary osteosarcoma because ofits better prognosis and different presentation. The tumouroccurs in older age group, has no sex predilection and is slowgrowing. Its common locations are metaphysis of long bones,most frequently lower end of the femur and upper end ofthe humerus. X-ray examination usually reveals a dense bonymass attached to the outer cortex of the affected long bone.\\nGrossly,  the tumour is lobulated and circumscribed,\\ncalcified mass in the subperiosteal location.\\nMicroscopically,  the features which characterise the usual\\nosteosarcoma (sarcomatous stroma and production of\\nneoplastic osteoid and bone) are present, but the tumourshows a high degree of structural differentiation, and thereare generally well-formed bony trabeculae. These featuresaccount for distinctly better prognosis in these cases.\\nPeriosteal osteosarcoma is a rare form of osteosarcoma that\\narises between the cortex and the overlying periosteum.  Its\\ncommon location is the diaphysis of the tibia or the femur.Microscopically,  periosteal osteosarcoma has cartilaginous\\ndifferentiation and higher degree of anaplasia than thatseen in parosteal osteosarcoma.\\nTable 28.3 sums up the contrasting features of central\\n(medullary) and surface (parosteal and periosteal)\\nosteosarcomas.\\nCARTILAGE-FORMING (CHONDROBLASTIC) TUMOURS\\nThe tumours which are composed of frank cartilage or\\nderived from cartilage-forming cells are included in this\\ngroup. This group comprises benign lesions like osteocartila-\\nginous exostoses (osteochondromas), enchondroma,\\nchondroblastoma and chondromyxoid fibroma, and a\\nmalignant counterpart, chondrosarcoma.\\nOsteocartilaginous Exostoses (Osteochondromas)\\nOsteocartilaginous exostoses or osteochondromas are the\\ncommonest of benign cartilage-forming lesions. Though\\ndesignated and discussed with neoplasms, exostosis or\\nosteochondroma is not a true tumour but is regarded as a\\ndisorder of growth and development (page 834). It may occur\\nas a ‘solitary sporadic exostosis’ or there may be ‘multiple\\nhereditary exostoses’.\\nExostoses arise from metaphyses of long bones as\\nexophytic lesions, most commonly lower femur and uppertibia (i.e. around knee) and upper humerus but may also be\\nfound in other bones such as the scapula or ilium. They are\\ndiscovered most commonly in late childhood or adolescence\\nand are more frequent in males. They may remain\\nasymptomatic and discovered as an incidental radiographic\\nfinding or may produce obvious deformity. Both solitary and\\nmultiple exostoses may undergo transformation into\\nchondrosarcoma but the risk is much greater with multiple\\nhereditary exostoses.\\nFigure 28.12 Osteosarcoma. Hallmarks of microscopic picture of the usual osteosarcoma are the sarcoma cells characterised by variation in\\nsize and shape of tumour cells, bizarre mitosis and multinucleate tumour giant cells, and osteogenesis i.e. production of osteoid matrix and bone\\ndirectly by the tumour cells.844SECTION III Systemic PathologyMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  osteochondro-\\nmas have a broad or narrow base (i.e. may be either sessile\\nor pedunculated) which is continuous with the cortical\\nbone. They protrude exophytically as mushroom-shaped,\\ncartilage-capped lesions enclosing well-formed cortical\\nbone and marrow (Fig. 28.13).\\nMicroscopically,  they are composed of outer cap\\ncomposed of mature cartilage resembling epiphyseal\\ncartilage and the inner mature lamellar bone and bone\\nmarrow (Fig. 28.14).Enchondroma\\nEnchondroma is the term used for the benign cartilage-\\nforming tumour that develops centrally within the interiorof the affected bone, while chondroma refers to the peripheraldevelopment of lesion similar to osteochondromas.Enchondromas may occur singly or they may be multiple,forming a non-hereditary disorder called enchondromatosis  or\\nOllier’s disease.  The coexistence of multiple enchondromas\\nwith multiple soft tissue haemangiomas constitutes a familialsyndrome called Maffucci’s syndrome.\\nMost common locations for enchondromas are short\\ntubular bones of the hands and feet, and less commonly, they\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 28.3.

These nodules have\\ncartilaginous caps and inner osseous tissue.845CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal Systeminvolve the ribs or the long bones. They may appear at any\\nage and in either sex. Enchondromas, like osteochondromas,may remain asymptomatic or may cause pain and pathologicfractures. X-ray reveals a radiolucent, lobulated tumour masswith spotty calcification. Malignant transformation of solitaryenchondroma is rare but multiple enchondromas maydevelop into chondrosarcoma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the enchondroma\\nis lobulated, bluish-grey, translucent, cartilaginous masslying within the medullary cavity.Histologically,  the tumour has characteristic lobulated\\nappearance. The lobules are composed of normal adulthyaline cartilage separated by vascularised fibrous stroma.Foci of calcification may be evident within the tumour.Enchondroma is distinguished from chondrosarcoma bythe absence of invasion into surrounding tissues and lackof cytologic features of malignancy.\\nChondroblastoma\\nChondroblastoma is a relatively rare benign tumour arising\\nfrom the epiphysis of long bones adjacent to the epiphysealcartilage plate. Most commonly affected bones are upper tibiaand lower femur (i.e. about knee) and upper humerus. Thetumour usually occurs in patients under 20 years of age withmale preponderance (male-female ratio 2:1). Theradiographic appearance is of a sharply-circumscribed, lyticlesion with multiple small foci of calcification. Chondro-blastoma may be asymptomatic, or may produce local pain,tenderness and discomfort. The behaviour of the tumour isbenign though it may recur locally after curettage.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  chondroblastoma\\nis a well-defined mass, up to 5 cm in diameter, lying inthe epiphysis. The tumour is surrounded by thin capsuleof dense sclerotic bone. Cut surface reveals a softchondroid tumour with foci of haemorrhages, necrosis andcalcification.Histologically,  the tumour is highly cellular and is\\ncomposed of small, round to polygonal mononuclear cellsresembling chondroblasts and has multinucleateosteoclast-like giant cells. There are small areas ofcartilaginous intercellular matrix and focal calcification.\\nChondromyxoid Fibroma\\nChondromyxoid fibroma is an uncommon benign tumour\\nof cartilaginous origin arising in the metaphysis of longbones. Most common locations are upper end of tibia andlower end of femur i.e. around the knee joint. Majority oftumours appear in 2nd to 3rd decades of life with malepreponderance. Radiologically, the tumour appears as asharply-outlined radiolucent area with foci of calcificationand expansion of affected end of the bone. The lesion maybe asymptomatic, or may cause pain, swelling and discomfortin the affected joint. The lesions may recur after curettage.Thus, there are many similarities with chondroblastoma.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  chondromyxoid\\nfibroma is sharply-demarcated, grey-white lobulatedmass, not exceeding 5 cm in diameter, lying in themetaphysis. The tumour is often surrounded by a layerof dense sclerotic bone. Cut surface of the tumour is softto firm and lobulated but calcification within the tumouris not as common as with other cartilage-forming tumours.Histologically, the tumour has essentially lobulated\\npattern. The lobules are separated by fibrous tissue andvariable number of osteoclast-like giant cells. The lobulesthemselves are composed of immature cartilage consistingof spindle-shaped or stellate cells with abundant myxoidor chondroid intercellular matrix.\\nIn view of close histogenetic relationship between\\nchondromyxoid fibroma and chondroblastoma, occasionaltumours show a combination of histological features of both.\\nChondrosarcoma\\nChondrosarcoma is a malignant tumour of chondroblasts.\\nIn frequency, it is next in frequency to osteosarcoma but isrelatively slow-growing and thus has a much betterprognosis than that of osteosarcoma. Two types ofchondrosarcoma are distinguished: central and peripheral.\\nCentral chondrosarcoma  is more common and arises\\nwithin the medullary cavity of diaphysis or metaphysis. Thistype of chondrosarcoma is generally primary i.e. occurs de\\nnovo.\\nPeripheral chondrosarcoma  arises in the cortex or peri-\\nosteum of metaphysis. It may be primary or secondaryoccurring on a pre-existing benign cartilaginous tumour suchas osteocartilaginous exostoses (osteochondromas), multipleenchondromatosis, and rarely, chondroblastoma.\\nBoth forms of chondrosarcoma usually occur in patients\\nbetween 3rd and 6th decades of life with slight malepreponderance. In contrast to benign cartilaginous tumours,majority of chondrosarcomas are found more often in thecentral skeleton (i.e. in the pelvis, ribs and shoulders); other\\nFigure 28.14 Osteochondroma. The overlying cap shows mature\\ncartilage cells covering the underlying mature lamellar bone containing\\nmarrow spaces.846SECTION III Systemic Pathologysite being around the knee joint. Radiologic appearance is of\\nhugely expansile and osteolytic growth with foci ofcalcification. Clinically, the tumour is slow-growing andcomes to attention because of pain and gradual enlargementover the years. Lower grades of the tumour recur followingsurgical removal but higher grades cause metastaticdissemination, commonly to the lungs, liver, kidney andbrain.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  chondrosarcoma\\nmay vary in size from a few centimeters to extremely largeand lobulated masses of firm consistency. Cut section ofthe tumour shows translucent, bluish-white, gelatinousor myxoid appearance with foci of ossification (Fig. 28.15).\\nHistologically,  the two hallmarks of chondrosarcoma are:\\ninvasive character and formation of lobules of anaplasticcartilage cells. These tumour cells show cytologic featuresof malignancy such as hyperchromatism, pleomorphism,two or more cells in the lacunae and tumour giant cells(Fig. 28.16) . However, sometimes distinction between a\\nwell-differentiated chondrosarcoma and a benignchondroma may be difficult and in such cases location,clinical features and radiological appearance are oftenhelpful.\\nRare variants of chondrosarcoma are mesenchymal\\nchondrosarcoma, dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma and clearcell chondrosarcoma.\\nGIANT CELL TUMOUR (OSTEOCLASTOMA)\\nGiant cell tumour or osteoclastoma is a distinctive neoplasm\\nwith uncertain histogenesis and hence classified separately.The tumour arises in the epiphysis of long bones close to thearticular cartilage. Most common sites of involvement arelower end of femur and upper end of tibia (i.e. about theknee), lower end of radius and upper end of fibula. Giantcell tumour occurs in patients between 20 and 40 years ofage with no sex predilection. Clinical features at presentationinclude pain, especially on weight-bearing and movement,noticeable swelling and pathological fracture. Radiologically,giant cell tumour appears as a large, lobulated and osteolyticlesion at the end of an expanded long bone with characteristic‘soap bubble’  appearance.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly, giant cell tumouris eccentrically located in the epiphyseal end of a long bonewhich is expanded. The tumour is well-circumscribed,dark-tan and covered by a thin shell of subperiosteal bone.Cut surface of the tumour is characteristically haemor-rhagic, necrotic, and honey-combed due to focal areas ofcystic degeneration (Fig. 28.17).\\nHistologically,  the hallmark features of giant cell tumour\\nare the presence of large number of multinucleateosteoclast-like giant cells regularly scattered throughoutthe stromal mononuclear cells (Fig. 28.18):\\nGiant  cells  often contain as many as 100 benign nuclei\\nand have many similarities to normal osteoclasts. Thesecells have very high acid phosphatase activity.\\nFigure 28.15 Chondrosarcoma, scapula. The bone is expanded\\nexternally due to a gelatinous tumour. Sectioned surface shows lobulated\\nmass with bluish cartilaginous hue infiltrating the soft tissues.\\nFigure 28.16 Chondrosarcoma. Histologic features include invasion of the tumour into adjacent soft tissues and cytologic characteristics of\\nmalignancy in the tumour cells.847CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal System\\nStromal cells  are mononuclear cells and are the real\\ntumour cells and their histologic appearance determines\\nthe biologic behaviour of the tumour. Typically, they areuniform, plump, spindle-shaped or round to oval cellswith numerous mitotic figures.\\nOther features  of the stroma include its scanty collagen\\ncontent, rich vascularity, areas of haemorrhages andpresence of macrophages.\\nGiant cell tumour of bone has certain peculiarities which\\ndeserve further elaboration. These are: its cell of origin,  its\\ndifferentiation from other giant cell lesions  and its biologic\\nbehaviour.CELL OF ORIGIN.  Though designated as giant cell tumour\\nor osteoclastoma, the true tumour cells are round to spindledmononuclear cells and not osteoclast-like giant cells.Histogenesis of tumour cells is uncertain but possibly theyare of mesenchymal origin. Available evidence suggests thatosteoclasts are derived from fusion of circulating monocytes,the process being facilitated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- β).\\nOTHER GIANT CELL LESIONS.  This peculiar tumour with\\nabove description is named ‘giant cell tumour’ but giant cellsare present in several other benign tumours and tumour-like lesions from which the giant cell tumour is to bedistinguished. These benign giant cell lesions  are:Figure 28.17 Giant cell tumour (osteoclastoma). The end of the\\nlong bone is expanded in the region of epiphysis. Sectioned surface\\nshows circumscribed, dark tan, haemorrhagic and necrotic tumour.\\nFigure 28.18 Osteoclastoma. Microscopy reveals osteoclast-like multinucleate giant cells which are regularly distributed among the mononucle ar\\nstromal cells.\\n848SECTION III Systemic Pathologychondroblastoma, brown tumour of hyperparathyroidism,\\nreparative giant cell granuloma, aneurysmal bone cyst,simple bone cyst and metaphyseal fibrous defect (non-ossifying fibroma).\\nBIOLOGIC BEHAVIOUR.  Giant cell tumours are best\\ndescribed as aggressive lesions or low grade malignant\\ntumour. About 40 to 60% of them recur after curettage,sometimes after a few decades of initial resection.Approximately 4% cases result in distant metastases, mainlyto lungs. Metastases are histologically benign and there isusually history of repeated curettages and recurrences. Thusattempts at histologic grading of giant cell tumour do notalways yield satisfactory results. One of the factorsconsidered significant in malignant transformation of thistumour is the role of radiotherapy resulting in developmentof post-radiation bone sarcoma though primary (de novo)\\nmalignant or dedifferentiated giant cell tumour may alsooccur.\\nEWING’S SARCOMA AND PRIMITIVE\\nNEUROECT ODERMAL  TUMOUR (ES/PNET)\\nEwing’s sarcoma (ES) is a highly malignant small round celltumour occurring in patients between the age of 5 and 20years with predilection for occurrence in females. Since itsfirst description by James Ewing in 1921, histogenesis of thistumour has been a debatable issue. At different times, thepossibilities suggested for the cell of origin have beenendothelial, pericytic, bone marrow, osteoblastic, and mesen-chymal; currently it is settled for origin from primitiveneuroectodermal cells. Now, Ewing’s sarcoma includes 3variants:i)classic (skeletal) Ewing’s sarcoma;\\ni\\ni) soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma; and\\niii) primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET).The three are linked together by a common neuroecto-\\ndermal origin and by a common cytogenetic translocationabnormality t(11; 22) (q24; q12). This suggests a phenotypicspectrum in these conditions varying from undifferentiatedEwing’s sarcoma to PNET positive for rosettes and neuralmarkers (neuron-specific enolase, S-100). However, PNETultimately has a worse prognosis.\\nThe skeletal Ewing’s sarcoma arises in the medullary\\ncanal of diaphysis or metaphysis. The common sites areshafts and metaphysis of long bones, particularly femur, tibia,humerus and fibula, although some flat bones such as pelvisand scapula may also be involved.\\nClinical features include pain, tenderness and swelling\\nof the affected area accompanied by fever, leucocytosis andelevated ESR. These signs and symptoms may lead to anerroneous clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis. However, X-ray examination reveals a predominantly osteolytic lesionwith patchy subperiosteal reactive bone formation producingcharacteristic ‘onion-skin’  radiographic appearance.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  Ewing’s sarcoma\\nis typically located in the medullary cavity and producesexpansion of the affected diaphysis (shaft) or metaphysis,often extending into the adjacent soft tissues. The tumourtissue is characteristically grey-white, soft and friable\\n(Fig. 28.19).\\nHistologically,  Ewing’s tumour is a member of small round\\ncell tumours  which includes other tumours such as: PNET,\\nneuroblastoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma,\\nlymphoma-leukaemias, and metastatic small cellcarcinoma. Ewing’s tumour shows the followinghistologic characteristics (Fig. 28.20):\\n1. Pattern.  The tumour is divided by fibrous septa into\\nirregular lobules of closely-packed tumour cells. TheseFigure 28.19 Ewing’s sarcoma. The tumour is largely extending\\ninto soft tissues including the skeletal muscle. Cut surface of the tumour\\nis grey-white, cystic, soft and friable.\\n849CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal Systemtumour cells are characteristically arranged around\\ncapillaries forming pseudorosettes.\\n2. Tumour  cells.  The individual tumour cells comprising\\nthe lobules are small and uniform resembling lymphocytesand have ill-defined cytoplasmic outlines, scantycytoplasm and round nuclei having ‘salt and pepper’chromatin and frequent mitoses. Based on thesecytological features the tumour is also called round cell\\ntumour  or small blue cell tumour.  The cytoplasm contains\\nglycogen that stains with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)reaction. The consistently expressed cell surface markerby tumour cells of ES/PNET group is CD99 which is aproduct of MIC-2  gene located on X and Y chromosome.\\n3. Other features.  The tumour is richly vascularised and\\nlacks the intercellular network of reticulin fibres. Theremay be areas of necrosis and acute inflammatory cellinfiltration. Focal areas of reactive bone formation maybe present.\\nEwing’s sarcoma metastasises early by haematogenous\\nroute to the lungs, liver, other bones and brain. Involvementof other bones has prompted a suggestion of multicentric\\norigin of Ewing’s sarcoma. The prognosis of Ewing’s sarcoma\\nused to be dismal (5-year survival rate less than 10%). Butcurrently, use of combined regimen consisting ofradiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy has improved theoutcome greatly (5-year survival rate 40-80%).\\nCHORDOMA\\nChordoma is a slow-growing malignant tumour arising from\\nremnants of notochord. Notochord is the primitive axialskeleton which subsequently develops into the spine.\\nNormally, remnants of notochord are represented bynotochordal or physaliphorous (physalis = bubble,  phorous =\\nbearing) cells present in the nucleus pulposus and a fewclumps within the vertebral bodies. Chordomas thus occurin the axial skeleton, particularly sacral and spheno-occipitalregion, and infrequently in the vertebrae. Chordoma isusually found in patients over the age of 40 years with nosex predilection. Radiographically, the tumour usuallyappears as an osteolytic lesion. Symptoms of spinal cordcompression may be present. The tumour grows slowly andinfiltrates adjacent structures but metastases develop rarely.Recurrences after local excision are frequent and the tumouralmost invariably proves fatal.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nsoft, lobulated, translucent and gelatinous with areas ofhaemorrhages.Microscopically,  chordoma is composed of highly vacuo-\\nlated physaliphorous cells surrounded by a sea ofintercellular mucoid material (Fig. 28.21).  Histologic\\ndifferentiation between chordoma and chondrosarcomaor mucin-secreting carcinoma may sometimes be difficult.\\nFigure 28.20 Ewing’s sarcoma. Characteristic microscopic features are irregular lobules of uniform small tumour cells with indistinct cytoplasmic\\noutlines which are separated by fibrous tissue septa having rich vascularity. Areas of necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate are also included. Inbox in\\nthe right photomicrograph shows PAS positive tumour cells in perivascular location.\\nFigure 28.21 Chordoma. The tumour cells are quite variable in size\\nhaving characteristic bubbly cytoplasm (physaliphorous cells) andanisonucleocytosis. The background is myxoid.850SECTION III Systemic PathologyMETASTATIC BONE TUMOURS\\nMetastases to the skeleton are more frequent than the primary\\nbone tumours. Metastatic bone tumours are exceeded infrequency by only 2 other organs—lungs and liver. Mostskeletal metastases are derived from haematogenous spread.\\nBony metastases of carcinomas predominate over the\\nsarcomas. Some of the common carcinomas  metastasising to\\nthe bones are from: breast, prostate, lung, kidney, stomach,thyroid, cervix, body of uterus, urinary bladder, testis,melanoma and neuroblastoma of adrenal gland. Examplesof sarcomas  which may metastasise to the bone are: embryonal\\nand alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma andosteosarcoma.\\nSkeletal metastases may be single or multiple. Most\\ncommonly involved bones are: the spine, pelvis, femur, skull,ribs and humerus. Usual radiographic appearance is of anosteolytic  lesion. Osteoblastic  bone metastases occur in cancer\\nof the prostate, carcinoid tumour and small cell carcinomaof lung.\\nMetastatic bone tumours generally reproduce the micros-\\ncopic picture of primary tumour (Fig. 28.22) . Many a times,\\nevidence of skeletal metastases is the first clinical manifes-tation of an occult primary cancer in the body.\\nJOINTS\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe joints are of 2 types —diarthrodial or synovial joints  with a\\njoint cavity, and synarthrodial or nonsynovial joints  without a\\njoint cavity. Most of the diseases of joints affect diarthrodial\\nor synovial joints. In diarthrodial joints, the ends of two bonesare held together by joint capsule with ligaments and tendonsinserted at the outer surface of the capsule. The articularsurfaces of bones are covered by hyaline cartilage which isthicker in weight-bearing areas than in nonweight-bearingareas. The joint space is lined by synovial membrane orsynovium which forms synovial fluid that lubricates the jointduring movements. The synovium may be smooth or throwninto numerous folds and villi. The synovial membrane iscomposed of inner layer of 1-4 cell thick synoviocytes andouter layer of loose vascular connective tissue. On electronmicroscopy, two types of synoviocytes are distinguished:type A and type B. Type A  synoviocytes are more numerous\\nand are related to macrophages and produce degradativeenzymes, while type B  synthesise hyaluronic acid.\\nDiseases of joints are numerous and joints are also invol-\\nved in several systemic disorders. In the following discussion,only those joint diseases which are morphologicallysignificant are described. Synovial tumours are discussed inthe next chapter together with other soft tissue tumours.\\nOSTEOARTHRITIS\\nOsteoarthritis (OA), also called osteoarthrosis or degenerative\\njoint disease (DJD), is the most common form of chronicdisorder of synovial joints. It is characterised by progressivedegenerative changes in the articular cartilages over theyears, particularly in weight-bearing joints.\\nTYPES AND PATHOGENESIS.  OA occurs in 2 clinical\\nforms—primary and secondary.\\nPrimary OA  occurs in the elderly, more commonly in\\nwomen than in men. The process begins by the end of 4th\\ndecade and then progressively and steadily increasesproducing clinical symptoms. Little is known about theetiology and pathogenesis of primary OA. The condition maybe regarded as a reward of longevity. Probably, wear andtear with repeated minor trauma, heredity, obesity, agingper se, all contribute to focal degenerative changes in thearticular cartilage of the joints. Genetic factors favouringsusceptibility to develop OA have been observed; geneticmutations in proteins which regulate the cartilage growthhave been identified e.g. FRZB  gene.\\nSecondary OA  may appear at any age and is the result\\nof any previous wear and tear phenomena involving the jointsuch as previous injury, fracture, inflammation, loose bodiesand congenital dislocation of the hip.\\nThe molecular mechanism of damage to cartilage in OA\\nappears to be the breakdown of collagen type II, probablyby IL-1, TNF and nitric oxide.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  As mentioned above, the\\nweight-bearing joints such as hips, knee and vertebrae aremost commonly involved but interphalangeal joints offingers may also be affected. The pathologic changes occurin the articular cartilages, adjacent bones and synovium(Fig. 28.23):\\n1. Articular cartilages.  The regressive changes are most\\nmarked in the weight-bearing regions of articular\\ncartilages. Initially, there is loss of cartilaginous matrix(proteoglycans) resulting in progressive loss of normalmetachromasia. This is followed by focal loss ofchondrocytes, and at other places, proliferation ofchondrocytes forming clusters. Further progression of theprocess causes loosening, flaking and fissuring of thearticular cartilage resulting in breaking off of pieces ofcartilage exposing subchondral bone. Radiologically, thisprogressive loss of cartilage is apparent as narrowed jointspace.\\nFigure 28.22 Osseous deposits from carcinoma breast.851CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal System2. Bone.  The denuded subchondral bone appears like\\npolished ivory. There is death of superficial osteocytes and\\nincreased osteoclastic activity causing rarefaction,microcyst formation and occasionally microfractures ofthe subjacent bone. These changes result in remodellingof bone and changes in the shape of joint surface leadingto flattening and mushroom-like appearance of thearticular end of the bone. The margins of the joints respondto cartilage damage by osteophyte  or spur formation. These\\nare cartilaginous outgrowths at the joint margins whichlater get ossified. Osteophytes give the appearance oflipping of the affected joint. Loosened and fragmentedosteophytes may form free ‘joint mice’ or loose bodies.\\n3. Synovium.  Initially, there are no pathologic changes\\nin the synovium but in advanced cases there is low-grade\\nchronic synovitis and villous hypertrophy. There may besome amount of synovial effusion associated with chronicsynovitis.\\nThe manifestations of OA are most conspicuous in large\\njoints such as hips, knee and back. However, the pattern ofjoint involvement may be related to the type of physicalactivity such as ballet-dancers’ toes, karate fingers etc. Minordegree of OA may remain asymptomatic. In symptomaticcases, clinical manifestations are joint stiffness, diminishedmobility, discomfort and pain. The symptoms are moreprominent on waking up from bed in the morning.Degenerative changes in the interphalangeal joints lead tohard bony and painless enlargements in the form of nodulesat the base of terminal phalanx called Heberden’s nodes.  These\\nnodes are more common in females and heredity seems toplay a role. In the spine, osteophytes of OA may cause com-pression of cervical and lumbar nerve root with pain, musclespasms and neurologic abnormalities.\\nRHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS\\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic multisystem disease\\nof unknown cause. Though the most prominent mani-festation of RA is inflammatory arthritis of the peripheraljoints, usually with a symmetrical distribution, its sy stemic\\nmanifestations include haematologic, pulmonary,neurological and cardiovascular abnormalities.RA is a common disease having peak incidence in 3rd to\\n4th decades of life, with 3-5 times higher preponderance infemales. The condition has high association with HLA-DR4and HLA-DR1 and familial aggregation. The onset of diseaseis insidious, beginning with prodrome of fatigue, weakness,joint stiffness, vague arthralgias and myalgias. This isfollowed by pain and swelling of joints usually insymmetrical fashion, especially involving joints of hands,wrists and feet. Unlike migratory polyarthritis of rheumaticfever, RA usually persists in the involved joint.Approximately 20% of patients develop rheumatoid noduleslocated over the extensor surfaces of the elbows and fingers.\\nAbout 80% of cases are seropositive for rheumatoid factor\\n(RF).  However, RF titres are elevated in certain unrelated\\ndiseases too such as in: viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, sarcoidosisand leprosy. Advanced cases show characteristic radiologicabnormalities such as narrowing of joint space and ulnardeviation of the fingers and radial deviation of the wrist.Other laboratory findings include mild normocytic andnormochromic anaemia, elevated ESR, mild leucocytosis andhypergammaglobulinaemia. Extra-articular manifestationsinfrequently produce symptoms, but when presentcomplicate the diagnosis.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  Present concept on etiology and\\npathogenesis proposes that RA occurs in an immunogenetically\\npredisposed individual to the effect of microbial agents acting as\\ntrigger antigen. The role of superantigens  which are produced\\nby several microorganisms with capacity to bind to HLA-DR molecules (MHC-II region) has also emerged.\\nI.Immunologic derangements.  A number of observations\\nin patients and experimental animals indicate the role of\\nimmune processes, particularly autoimmune phenomenon,in the development of RA. These include the following:\\n1. Detection of circulating autoantibody called rheumatoid\\nfactor (RF) against Fc portion of autologous IgG in about 80%\\ncases of RA. RF antibodies are heterogeneous and consist ofIgM and IgG class.\\n2\\n. The presence of antigen-antibody complexes (IgG-RF\\ncomplexes) in the circulation as well as in the synovial fluid.\\n3. The presence of other autoantibodies such as antinuclear\\nfactor (ANF), antibodies to collagen type II, and antibodiesto cytoskeleton.\\n4. Antigenicity of proteoglycans of human articular\\ncartilage.\\n5. The presence of γ-globulin, particularly IgG and IgM, in\\nthe synovial fluid.\\n6. Association of RA with amyloidosis.\\n7. Activation of cell-mediated immunity as observed by\\npresence of numerous inflammatory cells in the synovium,chiefly CD4+ T lymphocytes and some macrophages.\\nII. Trigger events.  Though the above hypothesis of a\\npossible role of autoimmunity in the etiology and patho-\\ngenesis of RA is generally widely accepted, controversycontinues as regards the trigger events which initiate thedestruction of articular cartilage. Various possibilities whichhave been suggested are as follows:\\n1. The existence of an infectious agent such as mycoplasma,\\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) or rubella\\nFigure 28.23 Fully-developed lesions in osteoarthritis (B), contrasted\\nwith appearance of a normal joint (A).852SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nvirus, either locally in the synovial fluid or systemic infection\\nsome time prior to the attack of RA.\\n2. The possible role of HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR1 in initia-\\ntion of immunologic damage.\\nThe proposed events in immunopathogenesis of RA are\\nas under  (Fig. 28.24):\\nIn response to antigenic exposure (e.g. infectious agent)\\nin a genetically predisposed individual (HLA-DR), CD4+ T-\\ncells are activated.\\nThese cells elaborate cytokines, the important ones being\\ntumour necrosis factor (TNF)- α, interferon (IF)- γ ,  interleukin\\n(IL)-1 and IL-6.\\nThese cytokines activate endothelial cells, B lymphocytes\\nand macrophages.\\nActivation of B-cells releases IgM antibody against  IgG\\n(i.e. anti-IgG); this molecule is termed rheumatoid factor (RF).\\nIgG and IgM immune complexes trigger inflammatory\\ndamage to the synovium, small blood vessels and collagen.\\nActivated endothelial cells express adhesion molecules\\nwhich stimulate collection of inflammatory  cells.Activation of macrophages releases more cytokines which\\ncause damage to joint tissues and vascularisation of cartilagetermed pannus formation.\\nEventually damage and destruction of bone and cartilage\\nare followed by fibrosis and ankylosis producing joint\\ndeformities.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The predominant patho-\\nlogic lesions are found in the joints and tendons, and lessoften, extra-articular lesions are encountered.\\nARTICULAR LESIONS. RA involves first the small joints\\nof hands and feet and then symmetrically affects the joints\\nof wrists, elbows, ankles and knees. The proximalinterphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints areaffected most severely. Frequently cervical spine isinvolved but lumbar spine is spared.Histologically,  the characteristic feature is diffuse\\nproliferative synovitis with formation of pannus. Themicroscopic changes are as under (Fig. 28.25):\\n1. Numerous folds of large villi of synovium.\\n2.Marked thickening of the synovial membrane due to\\noedema, congestion and multilayering of synoviocytes.3.\\nIntense inflammatory cell infiltrate in the synovial\\nmembrane with predominence of lymphocytes, plasma\\ncells and some macrophages, at places forming lymphoidfollicles.\\n4. Foci of fibrinoid necrosis and fibrin deposition.\\nThe pannus progressively destroys the underlying\\ncartilage and subchondral bone. This invasion of pannus\\nresults in demineralisation and cystic resorption of under-lying bone. Later, fibrous adhesions or even bonyankylosis may unite the two opposing joint surfaces. Inaddition, persistent inflammation causes weakening andeven rupture of the tendons.\\nEXTRA-ARTICULAR LESIONS.  Nonspecific inflam-\\nmatory changes are seen in the blood vessels (acute\\nvasculitis), lungs, pleura, pericardium, myocardium,lymph nodes, peripheral nerves and eyes. But one of thecharacteristic extra-articular manifestation of RA isoccurrence of rheumatoid nodules in the skin. Rheumatoid\\nnodules  are particularly found in the subcutaneous tissue\\nover pressure points such as the elbows, occiput andsacrum. The centre of these nodules consists of an area offibrinoid necrosis and cellular debris, surrounded byseveral layers of palisading large epithelioid cells, andperipherally there are numerous lymphocytes, plasmacells and macrophages. Similar nodules may be found inthe lung parenchyma, pleura, heart valves, myocardiumand other internal organs.\\nThere are a few variant forms of RA:\\n1. Juvenile RA  found in adolescent patients under 16 years\\nof age is characterised by acute onset of fever andpredominant involvement of knees and ankles. Pathologicchanges are similar but RF is rarely present.\\n2. Felty’s syndrome  consists of polyarticular RA associated\\nwith splenomegaly and hypersplenism and consequent\\nhaematologic derangements.\\nFigure 28.24 Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.853CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal System3. Ankylosing spondylitis or rheumatoid spondylitis  is\\nrheumatoid involvement of the spine, particularly sacroiliac\\njoints, in young male patients. The condition has a strongHLA-B27 association and may have associated inflammatorydiseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, anterior uveitisand Reiter’s syndrome.\\nSUPPURATIVE ARTHRITIS\\nInfectious or suppurative arthritis is invariably an acute\\ninflammatory involvement of the joint. Bacteria usually reachthe joint space from the bloodstream but other routes ofinfection by direct contamination of an open wound orlymphatic spread may also occur. Immunocompromised anddebilitated patients are increasingly susceptible tosuppurative arthritis. The common causative organisms aregonococci, meningococci, pneumococci, staphylococci,streptococci, H. influenzae  and gram-negative bacilli.\\nClinically, the patients present with manifestations of anylocal infection such as redness, swelling, pain and jointeffusion. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, neutrophilicleucocytosis and raised ESR are generally associated.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The haematogenous infec-\\ntious joint involvement is more often monoarticular ratherthan polyarticular. The large joints of lower extremitiessuch as the knee, hip and ankle, shoulder andsternoclavicular joints are particularly favoured sites. Theprocess begins with hyperaemia, synovial swelling andinfiltration by polymorphonuclear and mononuclearleucocytes alongwith development of effusion in the jointspace. There may be formation of inflammatorygranulation tissue and onset of fibrous adhesions betweenthe opposing articular surfaces resulting in permanentankylosis.TUBERCULOUS ARTHRITIS\\nTuberculous infection of the joints results most commonly\\nfrom haematogenous dissemination of the organisms frompulmonary or other focus of infection. Another route ofinfection is direct spread from tuberculous osteomyelitis closeto the joint. Uncommon in the West, the disease is seen notinfrequently in developing countries more commonly inchildren and also in adults.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Tuberculous involvement\\nof the joints is usually monoarticular type but tends to bemore destructive than the suppurative arthritis. Mostcommonly involved sites are the spine, hip joint and knees,and less often other joints are affected. Tuberculosis ofthe spine is termed Pott’s disease  or tuberculous spondylitis.\\nGrossly,  the affected articular surface shows deposition\\nof grey-yellow exudate and occasionally tubercles arepresent. The joint space may contain tiny grey-white loosebodies and excessive amount of fluid.Histologically,  the synovium is studded with solitary or\\nconfluent caseating tubercles. The underlying articularcartilage and bone may be involved by extension oftuberculous granulation tissue and cause necrosis (caries).\\nGOUT AND GOUTY ARTHRITIS\\nGout is a disorder of purine metabolism manifested by the\\nfollowing features, occurring singly or in combination:1.Increased serum uric acid concentration (hyperuricaemia).\\n2.Recurrent attacks of characteristic type of acute arthritis\\nin which crystals of monosodium urate monohydrate  may be\\ndemonstrable in the leucocytes present in the synovial fluid.3\\n. Aggregated deposits of monosodium urate monohydrate\\n(tophi)  in and around the joints of the extremities.\\nFigure 28.25 Rheumatoid arthritis. The characteristic histologic features are villous hypertrophy of the synovium and marked mononuclear\\ninflammatory cell infiltrate in synovial membrane with formation of lymphoid follicles at places.854SECTION III Systemic Pathology4.Renal disease involving interstitial tissue and blood\\nvessels.\\n5. Uric acid nephrolithiasis.\\nThe disease usually begins in 3rd decade of life and affects\\nmen more often than women. A family history of gout ispresent in a fairly large proportion of cases indicating role ofinheritance in hyperuricaemia. Clinically, the natural historyof gout comprises 4 stages: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia,acute gouty arthritis, asymptomatic intervals of intercriticalperiods, and chronic tophaceous stage. In addition, goutnephropathy and urate nephrolithiasis may occur (page 692).\\nTYPES AND PATHOGENESIS.  The fundamental bio-\\nchemical hallmark of gout is hyperuricaemia.  A serum uric\\nacid level in excess of 7 mg/dl, which represents the upper\\nlimit of solubility of monosodium urate in serum at 37°C atblood pH, is associated with increased risk of developmentof gout. Thus, pathogenesis of gout is pathogenesis of hyper-\\nuricaemia.\\nHyperuricaemia and gout may be classified into 2 types:\\nmetabolic  and renal,  each of which may be primary  or secondary.\\nPrimary refers to cases in which the underlying biochemicaldefect causing hyperuricaemia is not known, while secondarydenotes cases with known causes of hyperuricaemia.\\n1.Hyperuricaemia of metabolic origin.  This group\\ncomprises about 10% cases of gout which are characterised\\nby overproduction of uric acid. There is either an acceleratedrate of purine biosynthesis de novo,  or an increased turnover\\nof nucleic acids. The causes of primary metabolic gout  include\\na number of specific enzyme defects in purine metabolismwhich may be either of unknown cause or are inborn errorsof metabolism. The secondary metabolic gout is due to either\\nincreased purine biosynthesis or a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase.\\n2\\n. Hyperuricaemia of renal origin.  About 90% cases of gout\\nare the result of reduced renal excretion of uric acid. Altered\\nrenal excretion could be due to reduced glomerular filtrationof uric acid, enhanced tubular reabsorption or decreasedsecretion. The causes of gout of renal origin include diuretictherapy, drug-induced (e.g. aspirin, pyrazinamide, nicotinicacid, ethambutol and ethanol), adrenal insufficiency,starvation, diabetic ketosis, and disorders of parathyroid andthyroid. Renal disease per se rarely causes secondary\\nhyperuricaemia such as in polycystic kidney disease andleads to urate nephropathy.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The pathologic mani-\\nfestations of gout include: acute gouty arthritis, chronictophaceous arthritis, tophi in soft tissues, and renal lesionsas under:\\n1. Acute gouty arthritis.  This stage is characterised by\\nacute synovitis triggered by precipitation of sufficient\\namount of needle-shaped crystals of monosodium uratefrom serum or synovial fluid. There is joint effusioncontaining numerous polymorphs, macrophages andmicrocrystals of urates. The mechanism of acuteinflammation appears to include phagocytosis of crystalsby leucocytes, activation of the kallikrein system, activa-tion of the complement system and urate-mediateddisruption of lysosomes within the leucocytes leading torelease of lysosomal products in the joint effusion. Initially,there is monoarticular involvement accompanied withintense pain, but later it becomes polyarticular along withconstitutional symptoms like fever. Acute gouty arthritisis predominantly a disease of lower extremities, affectingmost commonly great toe.  Other joints affected, in order\\nof decreasing frequency, are: the instep, ankles, heels,knees, wrists, fingers and elbows.\\n2. Chronic tophaceous arthritis.  Recurrent attacks of\\nacute gouty arthritis lead to progressive evolution into\\nchronic arthritis. The deposits of urate encrust the articularcartilage. There is synovial proliferation, pannusformation and progressive destruction of articularcartilage and subchondral bone. Deposits of urates in theform of tophi may be found in the periarticular tissues.\\n3. Tophi in soft tissue.  A tophus  (meaning ‘a porous\\nstone’) is a mass of urates measuring a few millimeters to\\nFigure 28.26 A gouty tophus, showing central aggregates of urate crystals surrounded by inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and occasional giant\\ncells.855CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal Systema few centimeters in diameter. Tophi may be located in\\nthe periarticular tissues as well as subcutaneously suchas on the hands and feet. Tophi are surrounded byinflammatory reaction consisting of macrophages,lymphocytes, fibroblasts and foreign body giant cells(Fig. 28.26) .\\n4.Renal lesions.  Chronic gouty arthritis frequently\\ninvolves the kidneys. Three types of renal lesions aredescribed in the kidneys: acute urate nephropathy, chronicurate nephropathy and uric acid nephrolithiasis.i)Acute urate nephropathy  is attributed to the intratubular\\ndeposition of monosodium urate crystals resulting in acuteobstructive uropathy.ii)Chronic urate nephropathy  refers to the deposition of\\nurate crystals in the renal interstitial tissue.iii)Uric acid nephrolithiasis  is related to hyperuricaemia\\nresulting in hyperuricaciduria (page 692).\\nPSEUDOGOUT (PYROPHOSPHA\\nTE ARTHROPATHY)\\nPseudogout refers to an inflammatory joint involvement dueto deposition of calcium pyrophosphate in the joint space.The condition is seen in middle-aged and elderly individualsof either sex. The pain is usually less severe and involvementof big toe is rare. The pathogenesis is unclear but severalfactors have been implicated. These include: associatedmetabolic disease (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroi-dism, gout, ochronosis, Wilson’s disease and haemochroma-tosis), heredity, familial occurrence, rheumatoid arthritis andosteoarthritis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The involvement may be\\nmonoarticular or polyarticular but large joints such asknees, hips and shoulders are more often affected. Thejoint effusion contains crystals of calcium pyrophosphate.There is acute inflammatory response and deposits ofrhomboid crystals on the articular cartilage, ligaments,tendons and joint capsule, termed chondrocalcinosis.\\nPIGMENTED VILLONODULAR SYNOVITIS ANDTENOSYNOVIAL GIANT CELL TUMOUR(NODULAR TENOSYNOVITIS)\\nThe terms ‘pigmented villonodular synovitis’ and ‘nodular\\ntenosynovitis’ represent diffuse and localised formrespectively of the same underlying process. The localisedform of lesion is also termed xanthofibroma or benign\\nsynovioma. When the giant cells are numerous in localised\\ntenosynovitis, the condition is called giant cell tumour of tendon\\nsheath.\\nThe origin and histogenesis of these conditions are\\nunknown. They were initially regarded as inflammatory inorigin and hence the name synovitis. But currently cyto-genetic studies have shown clonal proliferation of cellsindicating that these lesions are neoplastic. Clinically, theypresent with pain, swelling and limitation of movement ofthe affected joint and may be easily mistaken for rheumatoidor infective arthritis. The lesions are adequately treated byexcision but recurrences are common.MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Though the two condi-\\ntions have many morphologic similarities, they are bestdescribed separately.\\n Giant cell tumour of tendon sheath (Nodular\\ntenosynovitis).  The localised nodular tenosynovitis is seen\\nmost commonly in the tendons of fingers.Grossly,  it takes the form of a solitary, circumscribed,\\npedunculated, small and lobulated nodule, measuring lessthan 2 cm in diameter. It is closely attached to andsometimes grooved by the underlying tendon. On section,the lesion is yellowish-brown.Histologically,  it is well encapsulated and is composed\\nof sheets of small oval to spindle-shaped cells, foamyxanthoma cells, scattered multinucleate giant cells andirregular bundles of collagen. Many of the spindle-shapedcells are haemosiderin-laden (Fig. 28.27).\\nPigmented villonodular tenosynovitis.  This is a\\ndiffuse form of synovial overgrowth seen most commonlyin the knee and hip.Grossly, the synovium has characteristic sponge-likereddish-brown or tan appearance with intermingledelongated villous projections and solid nodules.Histologically,  the changes are modified by recurrent\\ninjury. The enlarged villi are covered by hyperplasticsynovium and abundant subsynovial infiltrate oflymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, many ofwhich are lipid-laden and haemosiderin-laden.Multinucleate giant cells are scattered in these areas.\\nCYST OF GANGLION\\nA ganglion is a small, round or ovoid, movable, subcuta-\\nneous cystic swelling. The most common location is dorsumof wrist but may be found on the dorsal surface of foot nearthe ankle. Histogenesis of the ganglion is disputed. It maybe the result of herniated synovium, embryologicallydisplaced synovial tissue, or posttraumatic degeneration ofconnective tissue.\\nFigure 28.27 Tenosynovial giant cell tumour. The tumour shows\\ninfiltrate of small oval to spindled histiocytes with numerous interspersed\\nmultinucleate giant cells lyning in a background of fibrous tissue.856SECTION III Systemic PathologyMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  a ganglion is a\\nsmall cyst filled with clear mucinous fluid. It may or may\\nnot communicate with the joint cavity or tendon where itis located.Microscopically,  the cyst has a wall composed of dense\\nor oedematous connective tissue which is sometimes linedby synovial cells but more often has indistinct lining(Fig. 28.28).\\nBURSITIS\\nInflammation of bursa is termed bursitis. Bursae are synovial-\\nlined sacs found over bony prominences. Bursitis occursfollowing mechanical trauma or inflammation. It may resultfollowing a single injury such as olecranon bursitis  and\\nprepatellar bursitis,  but is more often due to repeated injuries\\nfrom excessive pressure such as in housemaid’s knee  or tennis\\nelbow.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly,  the bursal sac is\\nthick-walled and may contain watery, mucoid or granularbrown material.Histologically,  the bursal wall is composed of dense\\nfibrous tissue lined by inflammatory granulation tissue.The wall is infiltrated by lymphocytes, plasma cells andmacrophages and may show focal calcium deposits.\\nSKELETAL MUSCLES\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nStriated skeletal muscles consist of bundles of fibres called\\nfascicles,  each of which is surrounded by connective tissue\\nsheath termed perimysium. Perimysium contains blood\\nvessels and nerve supply of the muscle fascicles. Each musclefibre is enveloped by delicate fibrous stroma calledendomysium.\\nFigure 28.28 Cyst of ganglion. The cyst wall is composed of dense\\nconnective tissue lined internally by flattened lining. The cyst wall shows\\nmyxoid degeneration.Individual muscle fibre is an elongated multinucleated\\nsyncytium-like cell about 100 μm in diameter and several\\ncentimeters in length. The muscle nuclei are spindle-shaped\\nand lie at the periphery of fibre under the sarcolemma, theplasma membrane of muscle fibre. The cytoplasm of themuscle fibre contains myofilaments which are contractileelements. Myofilaments are of 2 types— myosin  comprising\\nthick filaments and actin  constituting thin filaments. These\\ntogether produce cross-striations in muscle fibres seen inlongitudinal sections on light microscopy. Sarcomeres  are the\\npartitions of myofilaments into equal zones. Each sarcomererepresents the distance between consecutive Z bands  and\\ncontains the central A (anisotropic) band, and the lateral I\\n(isotropic) bands.\\nThe major functions  of striated skeletal muscle are to\\nconvert chemical energy into mechanical energy, to act as astore of energy and proteins, and to play a role in themetabolism of the body. The muscle, however, cannotfunction as a contractile organ without a nerve supply. Forthis purpose, there are motor units,  each of which consists\\nof the following:1.Motor neuron cell body  located in the spinal cord anterior\\nhorn, or a cranial nerve nucleus.2. The axon  of the motor neuron in the peripheral or cranial\\nnerve.3. The neuromuscular junction.\\n4. The muscle fibres  innervated by the motor neuron.\\nThe muscle fibre contraction occurs by action potential\\ngenerated by chemical transmission of the impulse acrossthe synaptic gap by acetylcholine.\\nSkeletal muscles are affected in a number of systemic\\ndiseases and pathologic processes such as ischaemia andtoxic (Zenker’s) necrosis; atrophy and hypertrophy;degeneration and regeneration; and polymyositis, dermato-myositis, and various forms of infective myositis (e.g. viralmyositis, pyogenic myositis, gas gangrene and parasiticinvolvements such as cysticercosis). Most of the conditionshave been considered already in different chapters. Here, twoimportant groups of specific diseases—neurogenic andmyopathic diseases, are discussed. A classification ofneuromuscular disorders based on the part of the motor unitinvolved is presented in Table 28.4.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 28.4: Classification of Neuromuscular Diseases.\\nSite of Motor Unit Disease\\nI.

MUSCLE Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy857CHAPTER 28 The Musculoskeletal SystemNEUROGENIC DISEASES\\nThe group of neurogenic diseases affecting skeletal muscles\\nis characterised by a combination of muscular weakness andfatiguability. The most common of these is myastheniagravis; others are congenital myasthenia, an acquired Eaton-Lambert syndrome associated with carcinoma of the lung,and denervation atrophy.\\nMYASTHENIA GRAVIS\\nMyasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disorder of\\nautoimmune origin in which the acetylcholine receptors(AChR) in the motor end-plates of the muscles are damaged.The term ‘myasthenia’  means ‘muscular weakness’ and ‘gravis’\\nimplies ‘serious’; thus both together denote the clinicalcharacteristics of the disease. MG may be found at any agebut adult women are affected more often than adult men inthe ratio of 3:2. The condition presents clinically withmuscular weakness and fatiguability, initially in the ocularmusculature but later spreads to involve the trunk and limbs.There is about 10% mortality in MG which is due to severegeneralised disease and involvement of respiratory muscles.Several other autoimmune diseases have been foundassociated with MG such as autoimmune thyroiditis,rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, pernicious anaemia and collagen-vascular diseases.\\nPATHOGENESIS.  The pathogenesis of MG is best\\nunderstood in the context of normal muscle metabolism\\n(Fig. 28.29):\\nNormally,  acetylcholine is synthesised in the motor nerve\\nterminal and stored in vesicles that are releasedspontaneously when an action potential reaches the nerveterminal. Acetylcholine from released vesicles combines withAChRs, initiating an action potential which is propagatedalong the muscle fibre triggering muscle contraction.\\nIn MG,  the basic defect is reduction in the number of\\navailable AChRs at the postsynaptic muscle membrane. Inaddition, the postsynaptic folds are flattened. These changesresult in decreased neuromuscular transmission leading tofailure to trigger muscle action potentials and consequentweakened muscle contraction. The neuromuscularabnormalities in MG are mediated by autoimmune response.About 85-90% patients of MG have anti-AChR-antibodies intheir sera. These antibodies reduce the number of availableAChRs either by blocking the active sites of the receptors orby damaging the post-synaptic muscle membrane incollaboration with complement. The exact mechanism howautoimmune response is initiated is not completelyunderstood but the thymus appears to play a role in thisprocess (page 388). Majority of patients of MG may haveeither thymoma or thymic hyperplasia; thymectomy ishelpful in ameliorating the condition. The thymus possiblysensitises B cells to produce anti-AChR antibodies.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Grossly, the muscles\\nappear normal until late in the course of disease whenthey become wasted.\\nBy light microscopy,  a few clumps of lymphocytes may\\nbe found around small blood vessels. Degenerating\\nmuscle fibres are present in half the cases.\\nElectron microscopy  reveals reduction in synaptic area\\nof the motor axons due to flattening or simplification of\\npostsynaptic folds. The number of AChRs is greatlyreduced. By immunocytochemistry combined withelectron microscopy, it is possible to demonstrate thecomplex of IgG and complement at the neuromuscularjunctions.\\nDENERVATION ATROPHY\\nIf the muscle or a part of muscle is deprived of its motor\\nnerve supply, the affected muscle undergoes atrophy. Indemyelination, on the other hand, there is conduction blockin the nerve impulse but no denervation and hence muscleatrophy does not occur.\\nDenervating diseases are characterised by axonal\\ndegeneration and consequent muscle atrophy. These includeamyotrophic lateral sclerosis as an example of anterior horn\\ncell disease, and peripheral neuropathy  causing injury to\\nFigure 28.29 Neuromuscular junction in normal transmission (A) and in myasthenia gravis (B). The junction in MG shows reduced number of\\nAChRs, flattened and simplified postsynaptic folds, a widened synaptic space but a normal nerve terminal.858SECTION III Systemic Pathologymyelinated axon. The clinical manifestations of denervation\\natrophy are combination of muscular weakness and reducedmuscle bulk. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, there arecharacteristic fasciculations of muscles of the shoulder andtongue.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Denervation atrophy is\\npathologically characterised by groups of small angulatedmuscle fibres alternating with groups of plump, normalor even hypertrophic fibres with intact innervation.Further progression of the process may producesuperimposed changes of muscular dystrophy.\\nFigure 28.30 Normal skeletal muscle (A) contrasted with findings in Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy (B) showing hyaline fibres, fibre degenera tion,\\nloss of fibres and replacement by interstitial fibrosis and adipose tissue.\\nMYOPATHIC DISEASES (MYOPATHIES)\\nMyopathies are primary skeletal muscle diseases resulting\\nin chronic muscle weakness. These are divided into 5 broadgroups: hereditary (muscular dystrophies), inflammatory,endocrine, metabolic and toxic myopathies. Only thehereditary myopathies, also termed muscular dystrophies,are briefly considered below.\\nMUSCULAR DYSTROPHIES\\nMuscular dystrophies are a group of genetically-inherited\\nprimary muscle diseases, having in common, progressive and\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 28.5: Contrasting Features of Muscular Dystrophies.\\nType Inheritance Age at Clinical Features Other Systems Course\\nOnset Involved\\n1.\\nDuchenne’s X-linked By age 5 Symmetric weakness; initially Cardiomegaly; Progressive;\\ntype recessive pelvifemoral; later weakness reduced intelligence death by age 20\\nof girdle muscles; pseudo- due to respiratory\\n hypertrophy of calf muscles failure\\n2.

Each\\ntype of muscular dystrophy is a distinct entity havingdifferences in inheritance pattern, age at onset, clinicalfeatures, other organ system involvements and clinicalcourse. These differences are summarised in Table 28.5 .\\nHowever, in general, muscular dystrophies manifest inchildhood or in early adulthood. Family history ofneuromuscular disease is elicited in many cases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Common to all forms of\\nmuscular dystrophies are muscle fibre necrosis,regenerative activity, replacement by interstitial fibrosisand adipose tissue (Fig. 28.30) .\\nq860SECTION III Systemic Pathology\\nSoft Tissue Tumours Chapter 29Chapter 29\\nGENERAL FEATURES\\nINTRODUCTION. For the purpose of classification of this\\ngroup of tumours, the WHO has defined soft tissues as all\\n“non-epithelial extra-skeletal tissues of the body except thereticuloendothelial system, the glia and the supportingtissues of specific organs and viscera”. Thus, soft  tissuesincluded for the purpose of categorisation of their tumoursare: fibrous tissue, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, synovialtissue, blood vessels and neuroectodermal tissues of theperipheral and autonomic nervous system. The lesions ofthese tissues are embryologically derived from mesoderm,except those of peripheral nerve which are derived from ecto-derm. Tumours of smooth muscle tissue, blood vessels andnerves are described elsewhere in the book, while tumoursand tumour-like lesions composed of other soft tissues arediscussed in this chapter.\\nBenign soft tissue tumours are about 100 times more\\ncommon than sarcomas. Sarcomas rarely arise from malig-nant transformation of a pre-existing benign tumour. Instead,sarcomas originate from the primitive mesenchymal cellshaving the capacity to differentiate along different cell path-ways. As discussed in Chapter 8, soft tissue sarcomasmetastasise most frequently by the haematogenous route anddisseminate commonly to the lungs, liver, bone and brain.Lymph node metastases are often late and are associated withwidespread dissemination of the tumour. Histologic differen-tiation and grading of soft tissue sarcomas are importantbecause of varying clinical behaviour, prognosis andresponse to therapy.\\nMajority of soft tissue tumours have following important\\ngeneral features:\\nSuperficially-located tumours tend to be benign while\\ndeep-seated lesions are more likely to be malignant.\\nLarge-sized tumours  are generally more malignant than\\nsmall ones.\\nRapidly-growing tumours  often behave as malignant\\ntumours than those that develop slowly.\\nMalignant tumours have frequently  increased vascularity\\nwhile benign tumours are selectively avascular.\\nAlthough soft tissue tumours may arise anywhere in the\\nbody but in general  more common locations  are: lower\\nextremity (40%), upper extremity (20%), trunk andretroperitoneum (30%) and head and neck (10%).\\nGenerally, males  are affected more commonly than\\nfemales.\\nApproximately 15% of soft tissue tumours occur in\\nchildren and include some specific examples of soft tissue\\nsarcomas e.g. rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma.ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS.  Etiology of soft tissue\\ntumours remains largely unknown; however, a few commonfeatures in etiology and pathogenesis apply to many softtissue tumours:1. Frequently there is history of antecedent trauma which may\\nbring the tumour to attention of the patient.2. Molecular and cytogenetic studies in many soft tissuetumours reveal chromosomal abnormalities and mutations in\\ngenes which can be used as a marker for diagnosis andhistogenesis e.g. translocations, various fusion genes etc.3. Most of the soft tissue tumours occur sporadically;  however\\nthere are a few examples which are components of genetic\\nsyndromes e.g. neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni\\nsyndrome, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome etc.\\nCLASSIFICATION.  Currently, the WHO classification\\ndivides all soft tissue tumours into following 4 categories:\\nBenign:  These soft tissue tumours generally do not recur and\\nare cured by complete excision. Common example is lipoma.\\nIntermediate, locally aggressive:  These tumours are locally\\ndestructive, infiltrative and often recur but do not\\nmetastasise. Such tumours are generally treated by wideexcision; for example desmoid tumour.\\nIntermediate, rarely metstasising:  This category of tumours\\nare also locally destructive, infiltrative and recurrent but in\\naddition about 2% cases may have clinical metastasis whichmay not be predicted by morphology. Common example inthis category is dermtofibrosarcoma protuberans.\\nMalignant:  Tumours in this category are clearly malignant—\\nthey are locally destructive, infiltrative and metastasise in a\\nhigh percent of cases. The metastatic rate in low-gradesarcomas is about 2-10% and in high-grade sarcomas is20-100%.\\nDIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA.  Accurate pathological diagnosis\\nof soft tissue tumours is based on histogenesis which is\\nimportant for determining the prognosis and can be madeby the following plan:\\n1.Cell patterns:  Several morphological patterns in which\\ntumour cells are arranged are peculiar in different tumours\\ne.g.i) Smooth muscle tumours:  interlacing fascicles of pink staining\\ntumour cells.ii) Fibrohistiocytic tumours:  characteristically have storiform\\npattern in which spindle tumour cells radiate from the centrein a spoke-wheel manner.iii) Herringbone pattern: is seen in fibrosarcoma in which\\nthe tumour cells are arranged like the vertebral column ofseafish.861CHAPTER 29 Soft Tissue Tumoursiv) Pallisaded arrangement:  is characteristically seen in\\nschwannomas in which the nuclei of tumour cells are piled\\nupon each other.v) Biphasic pattern:  is the term used for a combination\\narrangement of two types—fascicles and epithelial-like e.g.in synovial sarcoma.\\n2. Cell types: After looking at the pattern of cells described\\nabove, preliminary categorisation of soft tissue tumours is\\ndone on the basis of cell types comprising the soft tissuetumour:\\ni) Spindle cells:  These are the most common cell types in\\nmost sarcomas. However, there are subtle differences in\\ndifferent types of spindle cells e.g.a) Fibrogenic tumours  have spindle cells with light pink\\ncytoplasm and tapering-ended nuclei.b) Neurogenic (Schwann cell) tumours  have tumour cells similar\\nto fibrogenic cells but have curved nuclei.c) Leiomyomatous tumours have spindle cells with blunt-ended\\n(cigar-shaped) nuclei and more intense eosinophiliccytoplasm.d) Skeletal muscle  tumours  have spindle cells similar to\\nleiomyomatous cells but in addition have cytoplasmicstriations.\\nii) Small round cells:  Some soft tissue sarcomas are\\ncharacterised by dominant presence of small round cells or\\nblue cells and are termed by various names such as malignantsmall round cell tumours, round cell sarcomas, or blue celltumours (due to presence of lymphocyte-like round nuclearsize and dense blue chromatin). Examples of this group oftumours are as under:a) Rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal and alveolar types)b) Primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET)c) Ewing’s sarcomad) Neuroblastomae) Malignant lymphomas.\\nA few examples of epithelial tumours such as small cell\\ncarcinoma and malignant carcinoid tumours enter in thedifferential diagnosis of small round cell tumours.\\niii)Epithelioid cells:  Some soft tissue tumours have either\\nepithelioid cells as the main cells (e.g. epithelioid sarcoma)\\nor have epithelial-like cells as a part of biphasic pattern ofthe tumour (e.g. synovial sarcoma).\\n3. Immunohistochemistry: Soft tissue tumours are\\ndistinguished by application of immunohistochemical stains.\\nAntibody stains are available against almost each cellconstituent. Based on differential diagnosis made on routinemorphology, the panel of antibody stains is chosen forapplying on paraffin sections for staining. Some commonexamples are as under:i) Smooth muscle actin (SMA): for smooth muscle tumours.ii) Vimentin: as common marker to distinguish mesenchymalcells from epithelium.iii) Desmin: for skeletal muscle cells.iv) S-100: for nerve fibres.v) Factor VIII: antigen for vascular endothelium.vi) LCA (leucocyte common antigen): common marker forlymphoid cells.4. Electron microscopy: EM as such is mainly a research\\ntool and does not have much diagnostic value in soft tissuetumours but can be applied sometimes to look fortonofilaments or cell organelles.\\n5. Cytogenetics: Many soft tissue tumours have specific\\ngenetic and chromosomal changes which can be done for\\ndetermining histogenesis, or for diagnosis and prognosis.\\nGRADING. The number of pathological grades of soft tissue\\ntumours may vary according to different grading systems:\\n2 grade system (grade I-II as low and high grade), 3-gradesystem (grade I, II, III as low, intermediate and high grade)and 4 grade system (grade I-IV).  Pathological grading isbased on following 3 features:i)Tumour differentiation or degree of cytologic atypia\\nii\\n) Mitotic count\\niii) Tumour necrosis\\nSTAGING.  Different staging systems for soft tissue sarcomas\\nhave been described but two of the most accepted staging\\nsystems are Enneking’s staging and American Joint Committee\\n(AJC) staging system:\\nEnneking’s staging:  This staging system is accepted by most\\noncologists and is based on grade and location of tumour as\\nunder:\\nAccording to tumour location: T1 (intracompartmental) and\\nT2 (extracompartmental) tumours.\\nAccording to tumour grade : G1 (low grade) and G2 (high\\ngrade) tumours.\\nAccordingly, the stages of soft tissue tumours vary from\\nstage I to stage III as under :\\nStage I : G1 and T1-T2 tumours, but no metastases.\\nStage II:  G2 and T1 -T2 tumours, but without metstases.\\nStage III:  G1 or G2 , T1 or T2 tumours, but with metastases.\\nAJC staging:  This AJC system of staging is similar to\\nstaging for other tumours. It is based on TNM system in\\nwhich the primary tumor (T), the status of lymph nodes\\n(N) and presence or absence of metastases (M) are taken\\ninto consideration for staging, besides the histologic grade\\nof the tumour.\\nAfter these brief general comments, some important\\nexamples of tumours of different types of mesenchymal\\ntissue origin are described below.\\nTUMOURS AND TUMOUR-LIKE\\nLESIONS OF FIBROUS  TISSUE\\nFibromas, fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma are benign, tumour-like, and malignant neoplasms respectively, of fibrousconnective tissue.\\nFIBROMAS\\nTrue fibromas are uncommon tumours in soft tissues. Many\\nfibromas are actually examples of hyperplastic fibrous tissuerather than true neoplasms. On the other hand, combinationsof fibrous growth with other mesenchymal tissue elementsare more frequent e.g. neurofibroma, fibromyoma etc.\\nThree types of fibromas are distinguished:862SECTION III Systemic Pathology1. Fibroma durum  is a benign, often pedunculated and well-\\ncircumscribed tumour occurring on the body surfaces and\\nmucous membranes. It is composed of fully matured and\\nrichly collagenous fibrous connective tissue (Fig. 29.1) .\\n2. Fibroma molle or fibrolipoma,  also termed soft fibroma,\\nis similar type of benign growth composed of mixture of\\nmature fibrous connective tissue and adult-type fat.\\n3. Elastofibroma  is a rare benign fibrous tumour located in\\nthe subscapular region. It is characterised by association of\\ncollagen bundles and branching elastic fibres.\\nFIBROMATOSIS\\n‘Fibromatosis’ is the term used for tumour-like lesions of\\nfibrous tissue which continue to proliferate actively and maybe difficult to differentiate from sarcomas. These lesions may,therefore, be regarded as non-metastasising fibroblastictumours which tend to invade locally and recur after surgical\\nexcision. In addition, electron microscopy has shown that\\nthe cells comprising these lesions have features not only offibroblasts but of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells,so called myofibroblasts. Depending upon the anatomic\\nlocations and the age group affected, fibromatoses arebroadly grouped as under:\\nA. Infantile or juvenile fibromatoses  include: fibrous\\nhamartoma of infancy, fibromatosis colli, diffuse infantile\\nfibromatosis, juvenile aponeurotic fibroma, juvenilenasopharyngeal angiofibroma and congenital (generalisedand solitary) fibromatosis.\\nB. Adult type of fibromatoses  are: palmar and plantar\\nfibromatosis, nodular fascitis, cicatricial fibromatosis, keloid,\\nirradiation fibromatosis, penile fibromatosis (Peyronie’sdisease), abdominal and extra-abdominal desmoidfibromatosis, and retroperitoneal fibromatosis.\\nObviously, it is beyond the scope of the present discus-\\nsion to cover all these lesions. Some of the important formsof fibromatoses are briefly discussed here.KELOID.  A keloid is a progressive fibrous overgrowth in\\nresponse to cutaneous injury such as burns, incisions, insectbites, vaccinations and others. Keloids are found more oftenin blacks. Their excision is frequently followed byrecurrences.\\nGrossly,  the keloid is a firm, smooth, pink, raised patch\\nfrom which extend claw-like processes (keloid-claw).Histologically,  it is composed of thick, homogeneous,\\neosinophilic hyalinised bands of collagen admixed withthin collagenous fibres and large active fibroblasts. Theadnexal structures are atrophic or destroyed.\\nThere are some differences between a keloid and a\\nhypertrophic scar. A hypertrophic scar of the skin is more\\ncellular and has numerous fibroblasts than a keloid and iscomposed of thinner collagenous fibres. A keloid is aprogressive lesion and liable to recurrences after surgicalexcision.\\nNODULAR FASCITIS.  Nodular fascitis, also called\\npseudosarcomatous fibromatosis, is a form of benign and\\nreactive fibroblastic growth extending from superficial fasciainto the subcutaneous fat, and sometimes into the subjacentmuscle. The most common locations are the upper extremity,trunk and neck region of young adults. Local excision isgenerally curative. Less than 5% cases may have localrecurrence.\\nGrossly,  the lesion appears as a solitary well-cirumscribed\\nnodule (true to its name) in the superficial fascia. The size\\nmay vary from a centimeter to several centimeters in\\ndiameter.Microscopically,  various morphologic patterns may be\\nseen but most common is a whorled or S-shaped patternof fibroblasts present in oedematous background. Theindividual cells are spindle-shaped, plump fibroblastsshowing mild nuclear atypia. Typical mitoses are frequentbut atypical mitoses are not present.\\nPALMAR AND PLANTAR FIBROMATOSES. These\\nfibromatoses, also called Dupuytren-like contractures are the\\nmost common form of fibromatoses occurring superficially.\\nPalmar fibromatosis  is more common in the elderly males\\noccurring in the palmar fascia and leading to flexioncontractures of the fingers (Dupuytren’s contracture). It\\nappears as a painless, nodular or irregular, infiltrating,\\nbenign fibrous subcutaneous lesion. In almost half the cases,the lesions are bilateral.\\nPlantar fibromatosis  is a similar lesion occurring on the\\nmedial aspect of plantar arch. However, plantar lesions areless common than palmar type and do not cause contracturesas frequently as palmar lesions. They are seen more often in\\nadults and are infrequently multiple and bilateral. Essentially\\nsimilar lesions occur in the shaft of the penis (penile\\nfibromatosis  or Peyronie’s disease)  and in the soft tissues of the\\nknuckles (knuckle pads).\\nHistologically,  palmar and plantar fibromatoses have\\nsimilar appearance. The nodules are composed offibrovascular tissue having plump, tightly-packed fibro-Figure 29.1 Fibroma of the oral cavity. The circumscribed lesion is\\ncomposed of mature collagenised fibrous connective tissue.\\n863CHAPTER 29 Soft Tissue Tumoursblasts which have high mitotic rate. Ultrastructurally,\\nsome of the fibroblasts have features of myofibroblastshaving contractile nature. The palmar lesions frequently\\nextend into soft tissues causing contractures. Both palmar\\nand plantar lesions may remain stationary at nodularstage, progress, or regress spontaneously. Recurrence rateafter surgical excision in both forms is as high as 50-60%.\\nDESMOID FIBROMATOSES.  Desmoid fibromatoses or\\nmusculo-aponeurotic fibromatoses, commonly referred to asdesmoid tumours, are of 2 types: abdominal and extra-abdominal. Both types are, however, histologically similar.\\nClinically, both types behave in an aggressive manner and\\nhave to be distinguished from sarcomas. Recurrences arefrequent and multiple. The pathogenesis of these lesions isnot known but among the factors implicated are the role of\\nantecedent trauma, genetic influences and relationship to\\noestrogen as obsereved by occurrence of these lesions inpregnancy.\\nAbdominal desmoids  are locally aggressive infiltrating\\ntumour-like fibroblastic growths, often found in the musculo-aponeurotic structures of the rectus muscle in the anteriorabdominal wall in women during or after pregnancy.\\nExtra-abdominal desmoids,  on the other hand, are more\\ncommon in men and are widely distributed such as in the\\nupper and lower extremities, chest wall, back, buttocks, and\\nhead and neck region.\\nIntra-abdominal desmoids  present at the root of the small\\nbowel mesentery are associated with Gardner’s syndrome(consisting of fibromatosis, familial intestinal polyposis,osteomas and epidermal cysts).\\nGrossly,  desmoids are solitary, large, grey-white, firm and\\nunencapsulated tumours infiltrating the muscle locally.Cut surface is whorled and trabeculated.\\nMicroscopically,  their appearance is rather misleadingly\\nbland in contrast with aggressive local behaviour. Theyare composed of uniform-looking fibroblasts arranged in\\nbands and fascicles. Pleomorphism and mitoses are\\ninfrequent. The older regions of the tumour have hypo-\\ncellular hyalinised collagen.\\nFIBROSARCOMA\\nThe number of soft tissue tumours diagnosed as fibrosarcoma\\nhas now dropped, partly because of reclassification offibromatoses which have aggressive and recurrent behaviour,and partly due to inclusion of many of such tumours in the\\ngroup of fibrous histiocytomas (described later).\\nFibrosarcoma is a slow-growing tumour, affecting adults\\nbetween 4th and 7th decades of life. Most common locations\\nare the lower extremity (especially thigh and around the\\nknee), upper extremity, trunk, head and neck, and\\nretroperitoneum (Fig. 29.2) . The tumour is capable of\\nmetastasis, chiefly via the blood stream.Figure 29.2 Fibrosarcoma, common clinical location.\\nFigure 29.3 Fibrosarcoma. Microscopy shows a  well-differentiated tumour composed of spindle-shaped cells forming interlacing fascicles\\nproducing a typical Herring-bone p attern. A few mitotic figures are also seen.\\n864SECTION III Systemic PathologyGrossly,  fibrosarcoma is a grey-white, firm, lobulated and\\ncharacteristically circumscribed mass. Cut surface of the\\ntumour is soft, fishflesh-like, with foci of necrosis and\\nhaemorrhages.Histologically,  the tumour is composed of uniform,\\nspindle-shaped fibroblasts arranged in intersectingfascicles. In well-differentiated tumours, such areasproduce ‘herring-bone pattern’  (herring-bone is a sea fish)\\n(Fig. 29.3) . Poorly-differentiated fibrosarcoma, however,\\nhas highly pleomorphic appearance with frequent mitosesand bizarre cells.\\nFIBROHISTIOCYTIC  TUMOURS\\nThe group of fibrohistiocytic tumours is characterised by\\ndistinctive light microscopic features that include presenceof cells with fibroblastic and histiocytic features in varyingproportion and identification of characteristic cart-wheel or\\nstoriform pattern  in which the spindle cells radiate outward\\nfrom the central focus. The histogenesis of these cells isuncertain but possibly they arise from primitivemesenchymal cells or facultative fibroblasts which arecapable of differentiating along different cell lines. The groupincludes full spectrum of lesions varying from benign  (benign\\nfibrous histiocytoma) to malignant  (malignant fibrous\\nhistiocytoma), with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberansoccupying the intermediate  (low-grade malignancy) position.\\nBENIGN FIBROUS HISTIOCYTOMA\\nDepending upon the location and predominant pattern,\\nbenign fibrous histiocytomas include a number of diverseentities such as dermatofibroma, sclerosing haemangioma,fibroxanthoma, xanthogranuloma, giant cell tumour oftendon sheath and pigmented villonodular synovitis. Allthese tumours have mixed composition of benign fibroblasticand histiocytic pattern of cells and have been described inrelevant sections already.\\nDERMATOFIBROSARCOMA PROTUBERANS\\nDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a low-grade malignant\\ncutaneous tumour of fibrohistiocytic origin. The tumourrecurs locally, and in rare instances gives rise to distantmetastases. Most frequent location is the trunk.\\nGrossly,  the tumour forms a firm, solitary or multiple,\\nsatellite nodules extending into the subcutaneous fat andhaving thin and ulcerated skin surface.Histologically,  the tumour is highly cellular and is\\ncomposed of fibroblasts arranged in a cart-wheel orstoriform pattern.\\nMALIGNANT FIBROUS HISTIOCYTOMA\\nMalignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH) represent approxi-\\nmately 20-30% of all soft tissue sarcomas. It is the mostcommon soft tissue sarcoma and is the most frequent sarcomaassociated with radiotherapy. The tumour occurs morecommonly in males and more frequently in the age group of5th to 7th decades. Most common locations are the lowerand upper extremities and retroperitoneum. It begins as apainless, enlarging mass, generally in relation to skeletalmuscle, deep fascia or subcutaneous tissue. The tumour isbelieved to arise from primitive mesenchymal cells whichare capable of differentiating towards both fibroblastic andhistiocytic cell lines.\\nGrossly,  MFH is a multilobulated, well-circumscribed,\\nfirm or fleshy mass, 5-10 cm in diameter. Cut surface isgrey-white, soft and myxoid (Fig. 29.4) .\\nHistologically,  there is marked variation in appearance\\nfrom area to area within the same tumour. In general,\\nthere is admixture of spindle-shaped fibroblast-like cells\\nand mononuclear round to oval histiocyte-like cells  which\\nmay show phagocytic function. There is tendency for the\\nspindle shaped cells to be arranged in characteristic cart-\\nwheel or storiform pattern. The tumour cells show\\nvarying degree of pleomorphism, hyperchromatism,mitotic activity and presence of multinucleate bizarretumour giant cells. Usually there are numerous blood\\nvessels and some scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells\\n(Fig. 29.5) .  Important immunohistochemical markers for\\nMFH include vimentin, α-chymotrypsin, CD68 and\\nfactor VIII-a.\\nBesides the storifrom pleomorphic MFH as the\\nprototype, a few morphologic variants of MFH having\\nbearing on prognosis include the following:\\nMyxoid MFH  shows areas of loose myxoid stroma\\nin the cellular areas and has an overall better prognosis.\\nInflammatory MFH is an undifferentiated high-grade\\nMFH having prominent neutrophilic infiltrate besides\\nthe presence of eosinophils, histiocytes and xanthomacells.\\nPrognosis is determined by 2 parameters: depth of\\nlocation and size of the tumour. Deep-seated and large MFH\\nFigure 29.4 Malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The lobulated tumour\\ninfiltrating the skeletal muscle is somewhat circumscribed. Cut surface\\nis grey-white fleshy with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis.865CHAPTER 29 Soft Tissue Tumourssuch as of the retroperitoneum have poorer prognosis than\\nthose small in size and located superficially which come to\\nattention earlier. Metastases are frequent, most often to the\\nlungs and regional lymph nodes. Five-year survival rate isapproximately 30-50%.\\nTUMOURS OF ADIPOSE  TISSUE\\nLipomas and liposarcomas are the common examples of\\nbenign and malignant tumours respectively of adipose tissue.Uncommon varieties of adipose tissue tumours includehibernoma, a benign tumour arising from brown fat, andlipoblastoma (foetal lipoma) resembling foetal fat and foundpredominantly in children under 3 years of age.\\nLIPOMA\\nLipoma is the commonest soft tissue tumour. It appears as a\\nsolitary, soft, movable and painless mass which may remainstationary or grow slowly. Lipomas occur most often in 4thto 5th decades of life and are frequent in females. They may\\nbe found at different locations in the body but most commonsites are the subcutaneous tissues in the neck, back and\\nshoulder (Fig. 29.6,A) . A lipoma rarely ever transforms into\\nliposarcoma.\\nGrossly,  a subcutaneous lipoma is usually small, round\\nto oval and encapsulated mass. The cut surface is soft,lobulated, yellowish-orange and greasy (Fig. 29.6, B) .\\nHistologically,  the tumour is composed of lobules of\\nmature adipose cells separated by delicate fibrous septa.\\nA thin fibrous capsule surrounds the tumour (Fig. 29.7) .\\nA variety of admixture of lipoma with other tissue\\ncomponents may be seen. These include: fibrolipoma\\n(admixture with fibrous tissue), angiolipoma (combinationwith proliferating blood vessels) and myelolipoma(admixture with bone marrow elements as seen in adrenals).\\nInfrequently, benign lipoma may infiltrate the striated muscle\\n(infiltrating or intramuscular lipoma). Spindle cell lipomaand pleomorphic (atypical) lipoma are the other unusualvariants of lipoma. The latter type may be particularly\\ndifficult to distinguish from well-differentiated liposarcoma.Figure 29.5 Malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The tumour shows admixture of spindle-shaped pleomorphic cells forming storiform (cart-wheel)\\npattern and histiocyte-like round to oval cells. Bizarre pleomorphic multinucleate tumour giant cells and some mononuclear inflammatory cells are\\nalso present.\\nFigure 29.6 Lipoma. A, Common clinical location. B, The cut surface\\nof the tumour is soft, lobulated, yellowish and greasy.\\n866SECTION III Systemic PathologyLIPOSARCOMA\\nLiposarcoma is one of  the most common soft tissue\\nsarcomas in adults, perhaps next in frequency only to\\nmalignant fibrous histiocytoma. Unlike lipoma which\\noriginates from mature adipose cells, liposarcoma arisesfrom primitive mesenchymal cells, the lipoblasts.  The peak\\nincidence is in 5th to 7th decades of life. In contrast to\\nlipomas which are more frequently subcutaneous in\\nlocation, liposarcomas often occur in the deep tissues. Mostfrequent sites are intermuscular regions in the thigh,buttocks and retroperitoneum.\\nGrossly,  liposarcoma appears as a nodular mass, 5 cm or\\nmore in diameter. The tumour is generally circumscribed\\nbut infiltrative. Cut surface is grey-white to yellow,myxoid and gelatinous. Retroperitoneal masses aregenerally much larger.Histologically,  the hallmark of diagnosis of liposarcoma\\nis the identification of variable number of lipoblasts  which\\nmay be univacuolated or multivacuolated (Fig. 29.4). Thevacuoles represent fat in the cytoplasm. Four majorhistologic varieties of liposarcomas are distinguished:well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic(Fig. 29.8) :\\n1.Well-differentiated liposarcoma  resembles lipoma but\\ncontains uni- or multi-vacuolated lipoblasts.\\n2.Myxoid liposarcoma  is the most common histologic type.\\nIt is composed of monomorphic, fusiform or stellate cells\\nrepresenting primitive mesenchymal cells, lying dispersedin mucopolysaccharide-rich ground substance. Occasionaltumour giant cells may be present. Prominent meshworkof capillaries forming chicken-wire pattern is aconspicuous feature.Figure 29.7 Lipoma. The tumour shows a thin capsule and underlying lobules of mature adipose cells separated by delicate fibrous septa.\\nFigure 29.8 Liposarcoma. The tumour shows characteristic, univacuolated and multivacuolated lipoblasts with bizarre nuclei. Inset in the ri ght\\nphotomicrograph shows close-up view of a typical lipoblast having multivacuolated cytoplasm indenting the atypical nucleus.\\n867CHAPTER 29 Soft Tissue Tumours3.Round cell liposarcoma  is composed of uniform, round\\nto oval cells having fine multivacuolated cytoplasm with\\ncentral hyperchromatic nuclei. Round cell liposarcomamay resemble a signet-ring carcinoma but mucin stainshelp in distinguishing the two.4.Pleomorphic liposarcoma  is highly undifferentiated and\\nthe most anaplastic type. There are numerous largetumour giant cells and bizarre lipoblasts.\\nThe prognosis  of liposarcoma depends upon the location\\nand histologic type. In general, well-differentiated andmyxoid varieties have excellent prognosis, whilepleomorphic liposarcoma has significantly poorer prognosis.Round cell and pleomorphic variants metastasise frequentlyto the lungs, other visceral organs and serosal surfaces.\\nSKELETAL MUSCLE  TUMOURS\\nRhabdomyoma and rhabdomyosarcoma are the benign andmalignant tumours respectively of striated muscle.\\nRHABDOMYOMA\\nRhabdomyoma is a rare benign soft tissue tumour. It should\\nnot be confused with glycogen-containing lesion of the heartdesignated as cardiac rhabdomyoma which is probably ahamartomatous lesion and not a true tumour. Soft tissuerhabdomyomas are predominantly located in the head andneck, most often in the upper neck, tongue, larynx andpharynx.\\nHistologically,  the tumour is composed of large, round\\nto oval cells, having abundant, granular, eosinophiliccytoplasm which is frequently vacuolated and containsglycogen. Cross-striations are generally demonstrable insome cells with phosphotungstic acid-haematoxylin(PTAH) stain. The tumour is divided into adult and foetaltypes, depending upon the degree of resemblance oftumour cells to normal muscle cells.\\nRHABDOMYOSARCOMA\\nRhabdomyosarcoma is a much more common soft tissue\\ntumour than rhabdomyoma, and is the commonest soft tissuesarcoma in children and young adults. It is a highly malignanttumour arising from rhabdomyoblasts in varying stages ofdifferentiation with or without demonstrable cross-striations.Depending upon the growth pattern and histology, 4 typesare distinguished: embryonal, botryoid, alveolar andpleomorphic.\\n1. EMBRYONAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMA. The\\nembryonal form is the most common of the rhabdo-\\nmyosarcomas. It occurs predominantly in children under 12years of age. The common locations are in the head and neckregion, most frequently in the orbit, urogenital tract and theretroperitoneum.\\nGrossly,  the tumour forms a gelatinous mass growing\\nbetween muscles or in the deep subcutaneous tissues but\\ngenerally has no direct relationship to the skeletal muscle.Histologically,  the tumour cells have resemblance to\\nembryonal stage of development of muscle fibres. There\\nis considerable variation in cell types. Generally, thetumour consists of a mixture of small, round to oval cellsand spindle-shaped strap cells having tapering bipolarcytoplasmic processes in which cross-striations may beevident. The tumour cells form broad fascicles or bands.Mitoses are frequent.\\n2. BOTRYOID RHABDOMYOSARCOMA. Botryoid\\nvariety is regarded as a variant of embryonal rhabdomyo-sarcoma occurring in children under 10 years of age. It isseen most frequently in the vagina, urinary bladder and nose(page 724).\\nGrossly,  the tumour forms a distinctive grape-like\\ngelatinous mass protruding into the hollow cavity.Histologically,  the tumour grows underneath the muco-\\nsal layer, forming the characteristic cambium layer of\\ntumour cells. The tumour is hypocellular and myxoid withpredominance of small, round to oval tumour cells(Fig. 29.9) .\\n3. ALVEOLAR RHABDOMYOSARCOMA.  Alveolar type\\nof rhabdomyosarcoma is more common in older children andyoung adults under the age of 20 years. The most commonlocations, unlike the embryonal variety, are the extremities.\\nGrossly,  the tumour differs from embryonal type in arising\\ndirectly from skeletal muscle and grows rapidly as softand gelatinous mass.Histologically,  the tumour shows characteristic alveolar\\npattern resembling pulmonary alveolar spaces. Thesespaces are formed by fine fibrocollagenous septa. Thetumour cells lying in these spaces and lining the fibrous\\nFigure 29.9 Botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma, nose. The tumour shows\\nthe characteristic submucosal Cambium layer of tumour cells. The tumour\\ncells are round to oval and have anaplasia.\\n868SECTION III Systemic Pathologytrabeculae are generally small, lymphocyte-like with\\nfrequent mitoses and some multinucleate tumour giantcells (Fig. 29.10) . Cross-striation can be demonstrated in\\nabout a quarter of cases.\\n4. PLEOMORPHIC RHABDOMYOSARCOMA.  This less\\nfrequent variety of rhabdomyosarcoma occurspredominantly in older adults above the age of 40 years. Theyare most common in the extremities, most frequently in thelower limbs.\\nGrossly,  the tumour forms a well-circumscribed, soft,\\nwhitish mass with areas of haemorrhages and necrosis.Histologically,  the tumour cells show considerable\\nvariation in size and shape. The tumour is generallycomposed of highly anaplastic cells having bizarreappearance and numerous multinucleate giant cells.Various shapes include racquet shape, tadpole appear-ance, large strap cells, and ribbon shapes containingseveral nuclei in a row.\\nConventionally, the cross-striations can be demons-\\ntrated with PTAH stain in a few rhabdomyosracomas.Immunohistochemical stains include: myogenin, Myo-D1,desmin, actin, myosin, myoglobin, and vimentin.\\nTUMOURS OF UNCERTAIN HISTOGENESIS\\nSome soft tissue tumours have a distinctive morphology buttheir exact histogenesis is unclear. A few examples aredescribed below.\\nSYNOVIAL SARCOMA (MALIGNANT SYNOVIOMA)\\nWhether true benign tumours of synovial tissue exist is\\ncontroversial. Pigmented villonodular synovitis and giantcell tumours of tendon sheaths, both of which are tumour-like lesions of synovial tissues are discussed already on page855. Synovial sarcoma or malignant synovioma, on the other\\nhand, is a distinctive soft tissue sarcoma arising fromsynovial tissues close to the large joints, tendon sheaths,bursae and joint capsule but almost never arising withinjoint cavities. Most common locations are the extremities,frequently the lower extremity. However, synovial sarcomais also found in regions where synovial tissue is not presentsuch as in the anterior abdominal wall, parapharyngealregion and the pelvis. The tumour principally occurs inyoung adults, usually under 40 years of age. The tumourgrows slowly as a painful mass but may metastasise viablood stream, chiefly to the lungs.\\nThe histogenesis  of tumour is, believed to be from\\nmultipotent mesenchymal cells which may differentiatealong different cell lines.\\nGrossly,  the tumour is of variable size and is grey-white,\\nround to multilobulated and encapsulated. Cut surfaceshows fishflesh-like sarcomatous appearance with foci ofcalcification, cystic spaces and areas of haemorrhages andnecrosis.Microscopically,  classic synovial sarcoma  shows a\\ncharacteristic biphasic cellular pattern  composed of clefts\\nor gland-like structures lined by cuboidal to columnarepithelial-like cells and plump to oval spindle cells\\n(Fig. 29.11) . Reticulin fibres are present around spindle\\ncells but absent within the epithelial foci. The spindle cell\\nareas form interlacing bands similar to those seen infibrosarcoma. Myxoid matrix, calcification andhyalinisation are frequently present in the stroma. Mitosesand multinucleate giant cells are infrequent. Immuno-histochemically, both types of tumour cells are positivefor cytokeratin.\\nAn uncommon variant of synovial sarcoma is monophasic\\npattern  in which the epithelial component is exceedingly rare\\nand thus the tumour may be difficult to distinguish fromfibrosarcoma.Figure 29.10 Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The tumour is divided into alveolar spaces composed of fibrocollagenous tissue. The fibrous\\ntrabeculae are lined by small, dark, undifferentiated tumour cells, with some cells floating in the alveolar spaces. A few mult inucleate tumour giant\\ncells are also present.\\n869CHAPTER 29 Soft Tissue TumoursALVEOLAR SOFT PART SARCOMA\\nAlveolar soft part sarcoma is a histologically distinct, slow-\\ngrowing malignant tumour of uncertain histogenesis. Thetumour may occur at any age but affects children and youngadults more often. Most alveolar soft part sarcomas occur inthe deep tissues of the extremities, along the musculofascialplanes, or within the skeletal muscles.\\nGrossly,  the tumour is well-demarcated, yellowish and\\nfirm.Microscopically,  the tumour shows characteristic alveo-\\nlar pattern. Organoid masses of tumour cells are separatedby fibrovascular septa. The tumour cells are large andregular and contain abundant, eosinophilic, granularcytoplasm which contains diastase-resistant PAS-positivematerial. This feature distinguishes the tumour fromparaganglioma, with which it closely resembles.\\nGRANULAR CELL MYOBLASTOMA\\nGranular cell tumour is a benign tumour of unknown histo-\\ngenesis. It may occur at any age but most often affected areyoung to middle-aged adults. The most frequent locationsare the tongue and subcutaneous tissue of the trunk andextremities.\\nGrossly,  the tumour is generally small, firm, grey-white\\nto yellow-tan nodular mass.\\nHistologically,  the tumour consists of nests or ribbons of\\nlarge, round or polygonal, uniform cells having finely\\ngranular, acidophilic cytoplasm and small dense nuclei.The tumours located in the skin are frequently associatedwith pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the overlyingskin.\\nEPITHELIOID SARCOMA\\nThis soft tissue sarcoma occurring in young adults is peculiar\\nin that it presents as an ulcer with sinuses, often located onFigure 29.11 Classic synovial sarcoma, showing characteristic biphasic cellular pattern. The tumour is composed of epithelial-like cells lin ing\\ncleft-like spaces and gland-like structures, and spindle cell areas forming fibrosarcoma-like growth pattern.\\nthe skin and subcutaneous tissues as a small swelling. Thetumour is slow growing but metastasising.\\nGrossly, the tumour is somewhat circumscribed and has\\nnodular appearance with central necrosis.Microscopically, the tumour cells comprising the noduleshave epithelioid appearance by having abundant pinkcytoplasm and the centres of nodules show necrosis andthus can be mistaken for a granuloma.\\nCLEAR CELL SARCOMA\\nClear cell sarcoma, first described by Enginzer, is seen in\\nskin and subcutaneous tissues, especially of hands and feet.\\nMicroscopically, it closely resembles malignant\\nmelanoma, and is therefore also called melanoma of thesoft tissues.\\nTUMOUR-LIKE LESIONS\\nBesides the soft tissue tumours, there are some proliferative\\nconditions of the soft tissues which resemble clinically andmorphologically with soft tissue tumours. Importantexamples are nodular fascitis (pseudosarcomatous fascitis)and myositis ossificans. The former condition has alreadybeen described under fibromatous lesions while the latter isdiscussed below.\\nMYOSITIS OSSIFICANS\\nMyositis ossificans is a benign, tumour-like lesion\\ncharacterised by osteoid and heterotopic bone formation inthe soft tissues. It is a misnomer since the lesion neither occursexclusively in the skeletal muscle as the name leads one tobelieve, nor are the inflammation or ossification alwaysessential.\\nMyositis ossificans is generally preceded by history of\\nantecedent trauma to a skeletal muscle or its tendon. Thetrauma may be minor and repetitive e.g. to the adductor\\n870SECTION III Systemic Pathologymuscles of the thigh of a horseman, or may be single injury\\nfollowed by haemorrhage into the muscle. The patientgenerally complains of pain, tenderness and swelling.Richly vascularised granulation tissue replaces the affectedmuscle or tendon. Then follows development of osteoidand bone at the periphery, giving characteristic X-rayappearance.\\nGrossly,  the lesion appears as unencapsulated, gritty mass\\nreplacing the muscle.Histologically, the central region of the mass showsloosely-arranged fibroblasts having high mitotic activity.Towards the periphery, there is presence of osteoid matrixand formation of woven mineralised bone with trappedskeletal muscle fibres and regenerating muscle (myogenic)giant cells. The appearance is sufficiently atypical tosuggest osteosarcoma but osteosarcoma lacks maturationphenomena seen in myositis ossificans. This is why thecondition is also called pseudomalignant osseous tumour of\\nthe soft tissues.\\n❑871CHAPTER 30 The Nervous System\\nThe Nervous System Chapter 30Chapter 30\\nCENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe skull and the vertebrae form a rigid compartment\\nencasing the delicate brain and spinal cord. The average\\nweight of the brain is about 1400 gm in men and 1250 gm inwomen. The two main divisions of the brain— the cerebrumand the cerebellum, are quite distinct in structure. The braindoes not have lymphatic drainage. There are 2 types of tissues\\nin the nervous system:\\n1.Neuroectodermal tissues  which include neurons (nerve\\ncells) and neuroglia, and together form the predominant\\nconstituent of the CNS.\\n2.Mesodermal tissues  are microglia, dura mater, the lepto-\\nmeninges (pia-arachnoid), blood vessels and their\\naccompanying mesenchymal cells.\\nThe predominant tissues comprising the nervous system\\nand their general response to injury are briefly consideredbelow:\\n1. NEURONS.  The neurons are highly specialised cells of\\nthe body which are incapable of dividing after the first few\\nweeks of birth. Thus, brain damage involving the neurons isirreversible. Neurons vary considerably in size and shape.Their size may range from the small granular cells of thecerebellum to large Betz cells of the motor cortex. Some\\nneurons are round, others oval or fusiform but the prototypeof cortical neuron is pyramidal in shape. A neuron consists\\nof 3 main parts: the cell body, an axon and numerousdendrites (Fig. 30.1,A) . The cell body  (or perikaryon) is the\\nmain constituent of the neuron from which an axon and\\nnumerous dendritic processes extend. The cell bodies may\\nbe arranged in layers as in the cerebral cortex, or may beaggregated as in the basal ganglia. The cell body possesses alarge, round, centrally-placed nucleus having finely granularnuclear chromatin and a prominent nucleolus. The cytoplasmcontains polygonal, basophilic structures called Nissl\\nsubstance. It consists of aggregates of RNA, sheaves of rough\\nendoplasmic reticulum and intervening groups of freeribosomes. Besides Nissl substance, other special features ofthe cytoplasm of neuronal cell body are the presence ofmicrotubules, synaptic vesicles and neurofilaments whichare a form of intermediate filaments specific to neurons.\\nLipofuscin may be present due to ageing. Neuromelanin is\\nfound in neurons in the substantia nigra and pigmentednucleus of the pons.\\nNeurons respond to injury in a variety of ways depen-\\nding upon the etiologic agent and the pathologic processes.These include central chromatolysis, atrophy and\\ndegeneration of neurons and axons, and intraneuronal\\nstorage of substances.\\nNeuropil  is the term used for the fibrillar network formed\\nby processess of all the neuronal cells.\\n2.NEUROGLIA.  The neuroglia provides supportive matrix\\nand main tenance to the neurons. It includes 3 types of cells:\\nastrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells\\n(Fig. 30.1,B) . Neuroglia is generally referred to as glia; the\\nFigure 30.1 Cells comprising the nervous system.\\n872SECTION III Systemic Pathologytumours originating from it are termed gliomas, and reactive\\nproliferation of the astrocytes being called gliosis.\\ni) Astrocytes.  The astrocytes are stellate cells with\\nnumerous fine branching processes. In routine haematoxylin\\nand eosin stains, an astrocyte has round or oval vesicularnucleus, but unlike neuron, lacks a prominent nucleolus. Thecytoplasm is generally scanty. The processes radiate fromthe cell body. Depending upon the type of processes, twotypes of astrocytes are distinguished:\\nProtoplasmic astrocytes  have branched processes and are\\nfound mostly in the grey matter.\\nFibrous astrocytes  have long, thin processes and are present\\nmainly in the white matter.\\nSome astrocytic processes are directed towards neurons\\nand their processes, which others surround capillaries byterminal expansions called foot processes. The astrocytic\\nprocesses may not be visible by routine stains but can bedemonstrated by phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin(PTAH) stain. Ultrastructurally, these processes arecomposed of abundant intermediate filaments, mostlyvimentin.\\nThe main functions of astrocytes in health are physio-\\nlogical and biochemical support to the neurons andinteractions with capillary endothelial cells to establish bloodbrain barrier. In case of damage to the brain, astrocytes actlike fibroblasts of other tissues. The astrocytes in respond toinjury undergo hyperplasia and hypertrophy termed ‘gliosis’which is an equivalent of scar elsewhere in the body.\\nGemistocytic astrocytes  are early reactive astrocytes having\\nprominent pink cytoplasm. Long-standing progressivegliosis results in the development of Rosenthal fibres  which\\nare eosinophilic, elongated or globular bodies present on theastrocytic processes.\\nCorpora amylacea  are basophilic, rounded, sometimes\\nlaminated bodies, present in elderly people in the whitematter and result from accumulation of starch-like materialin the degenerating astrocytes.\\nii) Oligodendrocytes.  Oligodendrocytes are so named\\nbecause of their short and fewer processes when examined\\nby light microscopy with special stains ( oligo=short). In\\nhaematoxylin-eosin stained sections, these cells appear assmall cells with a darkly-staining nucleus resembling that ofsmall lymphocyte. The cytoplasm appears as a clear haloaround the nucleus. Oligodendrocytes are presentthroughout the brain in grey as well as white matter and aremost numerous of all other cells in the CNS. In grey matter,they are clustered around the neurons and are called satellite\\ncells.  In white matter, they are present along the myelinated\\nnerve fibres and are termed interfascicular oligodendroglia.\\nThe major function of oligodendrocytes is formation and\\nmaintenance of myelin. Thus, in this respect they arecounterparts of Schwann cells of the peripheral nervoussystem. Diseases of oligodendrocytes are, therefore, disordersof myelin and myelinisation such as inherited leucodys-trophies and acquired demyelinating diseases.\\niii)Ependymal cells.  The ependymal cells are epithelium-\\nlike and form a single layer of cells lining the ventricularsystem, aqueduct, central canal of the spinal cord and cover\\nthe choroid plexus. They are cuboidal to columnar cells andhave ciliated luminal surface, just beneath which are presentsmall bodies termed blepharoplasts.\\nThe ependymal cells influence the formation and\\ncomposition of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by processes ofactive secretion, diffusion, absorption and exchange. Thefunction of cilia is not very clear but probably they play arole in the circulation of CSF. The ependymal cells respondto injury by cell loss and the space left is filled by proliferationof underlying glial fibres.\\n3. MICROGLIA.  Microglia is the nervous system counter-\\npart of the monocyte-macrophage system. Although the term\\n‘microglia’ is commonly used but it is inappropriate sincethese cells, unlike neuroglia, are not of neuroectodermalorigin. Microglial cells (or Hortega cells) are not fixed butare mobile cells. These cells are found throughout the brainand are often present close to the blood vessels. Normally,microglial cells appear as small inconspicuous cells withbean-shaped vesicular nuclei, scanty cytoplasm and longcytoplasmic processes (Fig. 30.1,C) . In response to injury or\\ndamage, however, these cells have capability to enlarge insize, proliferate and develop elongated nuclei, so called rod\\ncells. Microglial cells may actually assume the shape and\\nphagocytic function of macrophages and form gitter cells. Thefoci of necrosis and areas of selective hypoxic damage to theneurons are surrounded by microglial cells which performphagocytosis of damaged and necrosed cells; this is knownas neuronophagia.\\n4. DURA MATER.  The dura mater is a tough fibrous\\ncovering of the brain which is closely attached to the skullon its inner layer of endocranial periosteum. In the region ofspinal canal, it encloses a potential space, the epidural space,\\nbetween the bone and the dura. The dura is composed ofdense collagen, fused with periosteum of the skull.\\n5. PIA-ARACHNOID (LEPTOMENINGES).  The lepto-\\nmeninges ( lepto= thin, slender) consisting of the pia and\\narachnoid mater form the delicate vascular membranous\\ncovering of the central nervous system. The pia mater isclosely applied to the brain and its convolutions, while thearachnoid mater lies between the pia mater and the duramater without dipping into sulci. Thus, a space is left betweenthe two layers of leptomeninges, known as subarachnoid space,\\nwhich contains the CSF. The major arteries and veins run inthe subarachnoid space and small nutrient arteries pass intothe cortex. Extension of the subarachnoid space between thewall of blood vessels entering the brain and their pial sheathsform a circumvascular space called Virchow-Robin space.\\nAnother important potential space is enclosed between thedura and the arachnoid membrane known as subdural space.\\nDEVELOPMENTAL ANOMALIES\\nThese malformations are the result of various inherited and\\nacquired factors. The acquired conditions include viral\\ninfections of the mother and foetus (e.g. rubella), intake ofdrugs (e.g. thalidomide), exposure to ionising radiation andfoetal anoxia. There are a large number of developmental873CHAPTER 30 The Nervous Systemmalformations of the CNS but only a few important and\\ncommon ones are mentioned here. Congenital hydrocephalus\\nis considered separately along with other types of hydro-\\ncephalus.\\nSpinal Cord Defects\\nSpina bifida  is the term applied to the malformations of the\\nvertebral column involving incomplete embryologic closure\\nof one or more of the vertebral arches (rachischisis), mostfrequently in the lumbosacral region. The vertebral defect isfrequently associated with defect in the neural tube structures\\nand their coverings. The bony defect may be of varying\\ndegree. The least serious form is spina bifida occulta  in which\\nthere is only vertebral defect but no abnormality of the spinalcord and its meninges. The site of bony defect is marked by\\na small dimple, or a hairy pigment mole in the overlying\\nskin. The larger bony defect, however, appears as a distinctcystic swelling over the affected site called spina bifida\\ncystica.  This is associated with herniation of the meninges\\nor the spinal cord, or both.\\nHerniation of the meninges alone through the bony\\ndefect, meningocele,  is a less common variety. The herni-\\nated sac in meningocele consists of dura and arachnoid.\\nThe commonest and more serious form is, however,\\nmeningomyelocele  in which the spinal cord or its roots also\\nherniate through the defect and are attached to the posteriorwall of the sac. In this defect, the dura and the skin in the sacare deficient. A more serious variant of meningomyeloceleis associated with hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari\\nmalformation.\\nA rare form of the defect is myelocele  or syringo-\\nmyelocele  in which there is defective closure of the spinal\\ncanal so that the sac consists of an open flat neural tissue\\nplate without skin covering and the CSF leaking through it.\\nMeningomyelocele and myelocele are frequently asso-\\nciated with neurologic defects of varying degree which\\ninclude bladder and bowel dysfunction, motor and sensory\\ndefects, and paraplegia.\\nThe existence of defect in bony closure in the region of\\noccipital bone or fronto-ethmoid junction may result in\\ncranial meningocele  and encephalocele.\\nSyringomyelia and Syringobulbia\\nThese are congenital malformations which manifest clinically\\nlater in life and often develop in association with certain\\nacquired lesions involving the CNS. Syringomyelia and\\nsyringobulbia are characterised by development of a  syrinx\\nor a tubular cavity in the spinal cord and medullarespectively. The cavity may be fusiform or irregular. It\\nusually begins in the grey matter of the spinal cord dorsal to\\nthe central canal. The syrinx is usually surrounded by glialtissue. If the cavity communicates with the spinal canal, it islined by ependymal cells. Since the fibres of lateral spino-\\nthalamic tract are frequently involved in the cavity, the\\nclinical effects include loss of pain and temperature sensationin the affected region.Arnold-Chiari Malformations\\nArnold-Chiari malformation is the term used for a group of\\nmalformations of the brain involving the brainstem and\\ncerebellum. The primary defect is elongation of the medulla\\nand part of the vermis of the cerebellum resulting from failureof the pontine flexure to form. Approximately 50% of childrenwith hydrocephalus have the Arnold-Chiari malformation.\\nFour types are described, of which type II malformation is\\nthe most common and is most frequently associated withcongenital hydrocephalus. Most patients of Arnold-Chiarimalformation have, in addition, meningomyelocele. The\\nmajor components of type II Arnold-Chiari malformation are\\nas follows:\\n1.Elongation of the medulla with part of fourth ventricle\\nin the cervical canal.2.\\nDistortion of the medulla forming a characteristic S-\\nshaped bend at the junction with the cervical spinal cord.\\n3. Lengthening and herniation of the cerebellar vermis and\\ncerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum resulting information of a mass over the upper cervical cord.\\nCombination of these abnormalities results in stenosis of\\nthe aqueduct or obstruction of the foramina of Luschka andMagendie causing internal hydrocephalus (discussed below).\\nHYDROCEPHALUS\\nHydrocephalus is the term used for increased volume of CSF\\nwithin the skull, accompanied by dilatation of the ventricles.In majority of cases of hydrocephalus, there is increasedintracranial pressure. This type of hydrocephalus involvingventricular dilatation is termed internal hydrocephalus.  A\\nlocalised collection of CSF in the subarachnoid space is calledexternal hydrocephalus.  For better understanding of causes and\\nmechanisms involved in the hydrocephalus, it is essential tobriefly review the source and circulation of CSF.\\nSource and Circulation of CSF\\nCSF is mainly produced by choroid plexus in the lateral, third\\nand fourth ventricle, and a small part is formed on the surfaceof the brain and spinal cord. The total volume of CSF is about120-150 ml. CSF formed in the lateral ventricles flows throughthe foramina of Munro to the third ventricle and from thereby the aqueduct of Sylvius to the fourth ventricle. The fluidthen passes through the foramina of Magendie and Luschkaof the fourth ventricle to reach the subarachnoid space of thebrain. It then spreads through the subarachnoid space overthe surface of the spinal cord. It is absorbed into the bloodby the arachnoid villi present along the dural venous sinuses(Fig. 30.2) .\\nTypes and Etiopathogenesis\\nHydrocephalus is classified into primary and secondary\\ntypes, the former being much more common, both types havedistinct etiology and pathogenesis.\\nPRIMARY HYDROCEPHALUS.  Primary hydrocephalus is\\ndefined as actual increase in the volume of CSF within the\\nskull along with elevated intracranial pressure. There are 3possible mechanisms of primary hydrocephalus:874SECTION III Systemic Pathology1. Obstruction to the flow of CSF.\\n2. Overproduction of CSF.\\n3. Deficient reabsorption of CSF.\\nHowever, obstruction to the flow of CSF is by far the\\ncommonest cause and is termed obstructive hydrocephalus.  The\\nterms non-communicating and communicating hydrocephalus\\nare used to denote the site of obstruction:\\nNon-communicating hydrocephalus.  When the site of\\nobstruction of CSF pathway is in the third ventricle or at the\\nexit foramina in the fourth ventricle, the ventricular systemenlarges and CSF cannot pass into the subarachnoid space.This is termed as non-communicating hydrocephalus.Among the common causes are the following:\\ni)Congenital non-communicating hydrocephalus e.g. stenosis\\nof the aqueduct, Arnold-Chiari malformation, progressive\\ngliosis of the aqueduct and intra-uterine meningitis.\\nii)Acquired non-communicating hydrocephalus may occur from\\nexpanding lesion within the skull. These conditions are as\\nunder:\\nTumours adjacent to the ventricular system e.g.\\nependymoma, choroid plexus papilloma, medullo-\\nblastoma and others.\\nInflammatory lesions e.g. cerebral abscess, meningitis.\\nHaemorrhage e.g. parenchymal haemorrhage, intra-\\nventricular haemorrhage, and epidural and subdural\\nhaematoma.\\nCommunicating hydrocephalus.  When obstruction to the\\nflow of CSF is in the subarachnoid space at the base of thebrain, it results in enlargement of the ventricular system butCSF flows freely between dilated ventricles and the spinalcanal. This is called communicating hydrocephalus. Thecauses of communicating hydrocephalus are non-obstructivewhich are as follows:\\ni)Overproduction of CSF  e.g. choroid plexus papilloma.\\nii)Deficient reabsorption of CSF  e.g. following meningitis, sub-\\narachnoid haemorrhage and dural sinus thrombosis.SECONDARY HYDROCEPHALUS.  Secondary hydro-\\ncephalus is much less common and is defined as compen-\\nsatory increase of CSF due to loss of neural tissue withoutassociated rise in intracranial pressure (normal pressurehydrocephalus) e.g. from cerebral atrophy and infarction.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  there is dilatation\\nof the ventricles depending upon the site of obstruction.There is thinning and stretching of the brain. The scalpveins overlying the enlarged head are engorged and thefontanelle remain open.Histologically,  severe hydrocephalus may be associated\\nwith damage to ependymal lining of the ventricles andperiventricular interstitial oedema.\\nINFECTIONS\\nA large number of pathogens comprising various kinds of\\nbacteria, fungi, viruses, rickettsiae and parasites can causeinfections of the nervous system. The micro-organisms maygain entry into the nervous system by one of the followingroutes:\\n1. Via blood stream.  Spread of infection by the arterial route\\nfrom another focus is the most common mode of spread of\\ninfection in the nervous system. Less often, the spread mayoccur by retrograde venous route and by lodgement of septicemboli in the brain.\\n2. Direct implantation.  Spread of infection by direct\\nimplantation occurs following skull fractures or through\\ndefects in the bony and meningeal coverings of the nervous\\nsystem.\\n3. Local extension.  Extension of infection from contiguous\\nfocus such as otitis media and frontal or mastoid sinusitis\\nmay occur.\\n4. Along nerve.  Certain viruses such as herpes simplex,\\nherpes zoster and rabies spread along cranial and peripheral\\nnerves and ascend to the CNS.\\nIn general, resultant lesions are in the form of either\\ndiffuse inflammation of the meninges (meningitis) and ofbrain parenchyma (encephalitis), or combination of both(meningoencephalitis). In addition, other inflammatorylesions of CNS include: brain abscess, epidural abscess,subdural empyema, septic thromboembolism of duralsinuses and encephalomyelitis. Some of the morphologicallysignificant lesions are described below.\\nMENINGITIS\\nMeningitis is inflammatory involvement of the meninges.\\nMeningitis may involve the dura called pachymeningitis,  or\\nthe leptomeninges (pia-arachnoid) termed leptomeningitis.\\nThe latter is far more common, and unless otherwisespecified, meningitis would mean leptomeningitis.\\nPachymeningitis is invariably an extension of the inflam-\\nmation from chronic suppurative otitis media or fromfracture of the skull. An extradural abscess  may form by\\nsuppuration between the bone and dura. Further spread of\\ninfection may penetrate the dura and form a subdural abscess.\\nOther effects of pachymeningitis are localised or generalisedleptomeningitis and cerebral abscess.Figure 30.2 Normal circulation of CSF.\\n875CHAPTER 30 The Nervous SystemLeptomeningitis, commonly called meningitis, is usually\\nthe result of infection but infrequently chemical meningitis\\nand carcinomatous meningitis by infiltration of the\\nsubarachnoid space by cancer cells may occur. Infectious\\nmeningitis is broadly classified into 3 types: acute pyogenic,acute lymphocytic (viral, aseptic) and chronic (bacterial orfungal).\\nAcute Pyogenic Meningitis\\nAcute pyogenic or acute purulent meningitis is acute infec-\\ntion of the pia-arachnoid and of the CSF enclosed in thesubarachnoid space. Since the subarachnoid space iscontinuous around the brain, spinal cord and the opticnerves, infection spreads immediately to whole of thecerebrospinal meninges as well as to the ventricles.\\nETIOPATHOGENESIS.  The causative organisms vary with\\nage of the patient:\\n1.Escherichia coli  infection is common in neonates with\\nneural tube defects.2.Haemophilus influenzae  is commonly responsible for\\ninfection in infants and children.\\n3.Neisseria meningitidis  causes meningitis in adolescent and\\nyoung adults and is causative for epidemic meningitis.\\n4.Streptococcus pneumoniae is causative for infection at\\nextremes of age and following trauma.\\nThe routes  of infection in acute pyogenic meningitis are\\nas follows:\\n1.Most commonly by the blood stream.\\n2. From an adjacent focus of infection.3.By iatrogenic infection such as introduction of micro-\\norganisms at operation or during lumbar puncture.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  pus accumulates\\nin the subarachnoid space so that normally clear CSF\\nbecomes turbid or frankly purulent. The turbid fluid isparticularly seen in the sulci and at the base of the brainwhere the space is wide. In fulminant cases, some degreeof ventriculitis is also present having a fibrinous coatingon their walls and containing turbid CSF. In addition,purulent material may interfere with CSF flow and resultin obstructive hydrocephalus.Microscopically,  there is presence of numerous\\npolymorphonuclear neutrophils in the subarachnoid spaceas well as in the meninges, particularly around the bloodvessels (Fig. 30.3) . Gram-staining reveals varying number\\nof causative bacteria.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS.  Acute bacterial\\nmeningitis is a medical emergency. The immediate clinicalmanifestations are fever, severe headache, vomiting,drowsiness, stupor, coma, and occasionally, convulsions. Themost important clinical sign is stiffness of the neck on forwardbending.\\nThe diagnosis  is confirmed by examining CSF as soon as\\npossible. The diagnostic alterations in the CSF in acutepyogenic meningitis are as under:\\n1. Naked eye appearance of cloudy or frankly purulent CSF.2.Elevated CSF pressure (above 180 mm water).\\n3\\n. Polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leucocytosis in CSF\\n(between 10-10,000/ μl).\\n4. Raised CSF protein level (higher than 50 mg/dl).5. Decreased CSF sugar concentration (lower than 40 mg/\\ndl).\\n6. Bacteriologic examination by Gram’s stain or by CSF\\nculture reveals causative organism.\\nAcute Lymphocytic (Viral, Aseptic) Meningitis\\nAcute lymphocytic meningitis is a viral or aseptic menin-\\ngitis, especially common in children and young adults.\\nAmong the etiologic agents are numerous viruses such as\\nenteroviruses, mumps, ECHO viruses, coxsackie virus,Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus-2, arthropode-borneviruses and HIV. However, evidence of viral infection maynot be demonstrable in about a third of cases.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  some cases show\\nswelling of the brain while others show no distinctivechange.Microscopically , there is mild lymphocytic infiltrate in\\nthe leptomeninges.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS.  The clinical\\nmanifestations of viral meningitis are much the same as inbacterial meningitis with features of acute onset meningealsymptoms and fever. However, viral meningitis has a benignand self-limiting clinical course of short duration and is\\ninvariably followed by complete recovery without the life-\\nthreatening complications of bacterial meningitis.\\nThe CSF findings  in viral meningitis are as under:\\n1.Naked eye appearance of clear or slightly turbid CSF.\\n2. CSF pressure increased (above 250 mm water).\\n3.Lymphocytosis in CSF (10-100 cells/ μl).Figure 30.3  Acute suppurative meningitis.\\n876SECTION III Systemic Pathology4. CSF protein usually normal or mildly raised.\\n5. CSF sugar concentration usually normal.6. CSF bacteriologically sterile.\\nChronic (Tuberculous and Cryptococcal) Meningitis\\nThere are two principal types of chronic meningitis—one\\nbacterial (tuberculous meningitis) and the other fungal\\n(cryptococcal meningitis). Both types cause chronicgranulomatous reaction and may produce parenchymallesions.\\nTuberculous meningitis  occurs in children and adults\\nthrough haematogenous spread of infection from tuber-\\nculosis elsewhere in the body, or it may simply be a mani-festation of miliary tuberculosis. Less commonly, the spreadmay occur directly from tuberculosis of a vertebral body.\\nCryptococcal meningitis  develops particularly in debilitated\\nor immunocompromised persons, usually as a result ofhaematogenous dissemination from a pulmonary lesion.\\nCryptococcal meningitis is especially an important cause of\\nmeningitis in patients with AIDS.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  in tuberculous\\nmeningitis, the subarachnoid space contains thick exudate,particularly abundant in the sulci and the base of the brain.\\nTubercles, 1-2 mm in diameter, may be visible, especially\\nadjacent to the blood vessels. The exudate in cryptococcal\\nmeningitis is scanty, translucent and gelatinous.\\nMicroscopically,  tuberculous meningitis shows exudate\\nof acute and chronic inflammatory cells, and granulomas\\nwith or without caseation necrosis and giant cells. Acid-\\nfast bacilli may be demonstrated. Late cases show dense\\nfibrous adhesions in the subarachnoid space and\\nconsequent hydrocephalus. Cryptococcal meningitis is\\ncharacterised by infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells,\\nan occasional granuloma and abundant characteristic\\ncapsulated cryptococci.\\nCLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS.  Tuberculous\\nmeningitis manifests clinically as headache, confusion,malaise and vomiting. The clinical course in cryptococcalmeningitis may, however, be fulminant and fatal in a fewweeks, or be indolent for months to years.\\nThe CSF findings  in chronic meningitis are as under:\\n1.Naked eye appearance of a clear or slightly turbid CSF\\nwhich may form fibrin web on standing.\\n2. Raised CSF pressure (above 300 mm water).3.Mononuclear leucocytosis consisting mostly of lympho-\\ncytes and some macrophages (100-1000 cells/ μl).\\n4.\\nRaised protein content.\\n5. Lowered glucose concentration.6. Tubercle bacilli may be found on microscopy of centri-\\nfuged deposits by ZN staining in tuberculous meningitis.\\nPathognomonic capsulated cryptococci with a halo are\\nappreciated in India ink preparation of CSF in cases ofcryptococcal meningitis, while the capsule is better\\ndemonstrated by mucicarmine stain (Fig. 30.4) .\\nTable 30.1 summarises the CSF findings in the three\\nimportant types of meningitis in comparison with those in\\nhealth.Figure 30.4 Cryptococci in CSF as seen in mucicarmine stain.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 30.1: CSF Findings in Health and Various Types of Meningitis.\\nFeature Normal Acute Pyogenic Acute Lympho- Chronic (Tuberculous)\\n(Bacterial) cytic (Viral) Meningitis\\nMeningitis Meningitis\\n1.Naked eye Clear and colourless\\nCloudy or frankly Clear or slightly Clear or slightly turbid, forms\\nappearance purulent turbid fibrin coagulum on standing\\n2.CSF pressure 60-150 mm water Elevated Elevated Elevated\\n(above 180 mm water) (above 250 mm water)  (above 300 mm water)\\n3.Cells 0-4 10-10,000 10-100 100-1000\\nlymphocytes/ μl neutrophils/μ l lymphocytes/μ l lymphocytes/μ l\\n4.Proteins 15-45 mg/dl Markedly raised Raised Raised\\n5.Glucose 50-80 mg/dl Markedly reduced Normal Reduced\\n6.Bacteriology Sterile Causative Sterile Tubercle bacilli\\norganisms present present\\n877CHAPTER 30 The Nervous SystemENCEPHALITIS\\nParenchymal infection of brain is termed encephalitis.\\nEncephalitis may be the result of bacterial, viral, fungal andprotozoal infections.\\nBacterial Encephalitis\\nBacterial infection of the brain substance is usually secondary\\nto involvement of the meninges rather than a primarybacterial parenchymal infection. This results in bacterialcerebritis that progresses to form brain abscess. However,\\ntuberculosis  and neurosyphilis  are the two primary bacterial\\ninvolvements of the brain parenchyma.\\nBRAIN ABSCESS.  Brain abscesses may arise by one of the\\nfollowing routes:\\n1. By direct implantation of organisms e.g. following\\ncompound fractures of the skull.\\n2.By local extension of infection e.g. chronic suppurative\\notitis media, mastoiditis and sinusitis.3.\\nBy haematogenous spread e.g. from primary infection in\\nthe heart such as acute bacterial endocarditis, and from lungs\\nsuch as in bronchiectasis.\\nClinically,  there is usually evidence of reactivation of\\ninfection at the primary site preceding the onset of cerebralsymptoms. The features of abscess are fever, headache,vomiting, seizures and focal neurological deficits dependingupon the location of the abscess. Brain abscess is mostcommon in cerebral hemispheres and less frequent in thecerebellum and basal ganglia.\\nGrossly,  it appears as a localised area of inflammatory\\nnecrosis and oedema surrounded by fibrous capsule.Microscopically,  the changes consist of liquefactive\\nnecrosis in the centre of the abscess containing pus. It issurrounded by acute and chronic inflammatory cells,neovascularisation, oedema, septic thrombosis of vessels,fibrous encapsulation and zone of gliosis. The CSF andoverlying meninges also show evidence of acute andchronic inflammation.\\nTUBERCULOMA. Tuberculoma is an intracranial mass\\noccurring secondary to dissemination of tuberculosiselsewhere in the body. Tuberculomas may be solitary ormultiple.\\nGrossly,  it has a central area of caseation necrosis\\nsurrounded by fibrous capsule.Microscopically,  there is typical tuberculous granu-\\nlomatous reaction around the central caseation necrosis(Fig. 30.5) . A zone of gliosis generally surrounds the\\ntuberculoma. Advanced cases may show areas ofcalcification.\\nNEUROSYPHILIS.  Syphilitic lesions of the CNS used to be\\ncommon and serious, but more recently there is evidence ofatypical neurosyphilis in cases of HIV/AIDS. The lesions insyphilis may be in the form of syphilitic meningitis  found in\\nsecondary syphilis, and neurosyphilis  consisting of tabesdorsalis and generalised paralysis of the insane occurring intertiary stage (page 161).\\nSyphilitic meningitis.  This is a form of chronic meningitis\\ncharacterised by distinctive perivascular inflammatory\\nreaction of plasma cells and endarteritis obliterans.\\nTabes dorsalis (Locomotor ataxia).  There is slowly pro-\\ngressive degeneration of the posterior roots of the spinal\\nnerves and the posterior columns of the spinal cord by thespirochaetes. These changes produce loss of coordination ofmuscles and joints resulting in locomotor ataxia. Thesechanges produce loss of coordination of muscles and jointsresulting in locomotor ataxia. There is also loss of painsensation and presence of \\nArgyll-Robertson pupils which\\nreact to accommodation but not to light.\\nGeneral paralysis of the insane.  This is the result of diffuse\\nparenchymal involvement by the spirochaetes with\\nwidespread lesions in the nervous system. The symptomsconsist of motor, sensory and psychiatric abnormalities.\\nViral Encephalitis\\nA number of viruses can infect the CNS and produce either\\naseptic meningitis (described already) or viral encephalitis,but sometimes combination of both termed meningo-encephalitis, is present. Most viral infections of the CNS arethe end-result of preceding infection in other tissues andorgans. There is usually a preceding phase of extraneuralviral replication before involvement of the nervous systemoccurs.\\nMost of the viruses reach the nervous system via blood\\nstream before which they enter the body by various routese.g. infection of the skin and mucous membrane (in herpessimplex and herpes zoster-varicella), by the alimentary tract(in enteroviruses including polio virus), by arthropod bite(in arbovirus), by transplacental infection (in cytomegalo-virus), and through body fluids in AIDS (in HIV infection).Figure 30.5 Tuberculous encephalitis of the brain.\\n878SECTION III Systemic PathologyRabies virus travels along the peripheral nerves to reach the\\nCNS. Herpes zoster-varicella is a distinct primary disease(chickenpox) but the virus remains latent for a long timebefore it gets reactivated to cause severe hyperalgesia andpain along the distribution of nerve related to acutelyinflamed posterior root ganglia (herpes zoster). All these viralinfections enumerated so far cause acute viral encephalitis. Slow\\nvirus diseases  are another group of CNS infections in which\\nthe agents have not only a long latent period but the diseasealso develops slowly and may produce subacute sclerosingpanencephalitis, progressive multifocal leucoence-phalopathy, progressive rubella panencephalopathy andsubacute spongiform encephalopathy.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Although histologic\\nchanges vary from one viral infection of the CNS to theother but, in general, the characteristic features of viraldiseases of the CNS are as under:1. Parenchymal infiltrate, chiefly in perivascular location,of mononuclear cells consisting of lymphocytes, plasmacells and macrophages.2. Microscopic clusters of microglial cells and presenceof neuronophagia.3. Intranuclear inclusion bodies in most viral diseasesand specific cytoplasmic inclusions of Negri bodies inrabies.\\nHIV Encephalopathy (AIDS-Dementia Complex)\\nNext to knocking off of the immune system, HIV has profound\\nneurovirulence but unlike tropism for CD4+ T cells of theimmune system, HIV does not have neurotropism. HIV hasnot been identified to infect the neuronal cells but insteadinfects the cells of monocyte-macrophage cell line includingmicroglial cells. HIV infection then sets in a cascade of toxicmediators and cytokines—TNF- α,IL-1, IL-6, TGF- β,\\nIFN- γ, platelet activating factor (PAF) and endothelin, all of\\nwhich cause damage to the neuroglial tissues.\\nImportant forms of CNS diseases in patients with AIDS\\nare listed in Table 30.2 .\\n Late in the course of AIDS, a group\\nof signs  and symptoms of CNS disease appear termed HIV\\nencephalopathy or AIDS-dementia complex. One majorclinical feature of this entity is the occurrence of dementia  i.e.\\nfall in the cognitive ability of the individual compared toprevious level. The condition is believed to be the result ofdirect effect of HIV on the CNS. Clinically, the diseasedevelops in about 25% cases of AIDS while autopsy studiesreveal presence of HIV-encephalopathy in 80-90% cases ofAIDS.\\nHistologically,  the changes are more in subcortical area\\nof the brain and consist of gliosis, multinucleate giant cellencephalitis, and vacuolar myelopathy.\\nProgressive Multifocal Leucoencephalopathy\\nProgressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) is a slow\\nviral infection of the CNS caused by a papovavirus called JC\\nvirus  (not to be confused with CJ disease or mad-cow disease;\\nJC virus here stands for the initials of the patient firstinfected). PML develops in immunocompromised individuallike CMV and Toxoplasma encephalitis does, and is, therefore,\\nan important form of encephalitis due to increasing numberof cases of AIDS.\\nPML infects oligodendrocytes and causes progressive\\ndemyelination at multifocal areas scattered throughout theCNS.\\nGrossly,  the lesions consist of focal, irregular gelatinous\\nareas most prominent at the junction of grey and whitematter. Main areas affected are cerebrum, brainstem,cerebellum, and sometimes spinal cord.\\nMicroscopically , the features are as under:\\nFocal areas of demyelination.\\nMany lipid-laden macrophages in the centre of foci.\\nEnlarged oligodendroglial nuclei containing purple\\nviral inclusions at the periphery of the lesion.\\nSpongiform Encephalopathy\\n(Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease)\\nSpongiform encephalopathy, also called Creutzfeldt-Jakobdisease (CJD) or mad-cow disease, though included underthe group of viral encephalitis but is caused by accumulationof prion proteins. Prion proteins  are a modified form of normal\\nstructural proteins present in the mammalian CNS and arepeculiar in two respects: they lack nucleic acid (DNA orRNA), and they can be transmitted as an infectious proteina-ceous particles (Dr Prusiner was awarded the Nobel Prize inmedicine in 1997 for his discovery on prion proteins).\\nMajority of cases occur sporadically though familial\\npredisposition with autosomal dominant inheritance has alsobeen reported in 5-15% cases. Other methods of transmissionare by iatrogenic route (e.g. by tissue transplantation froman infected individual) and by human consumption of BSE(bovine spongiform encephalopathy)-infected beef, alsocalled as mad-cow disease.\\nClinically, CJD is characterised by rapidly progressive\\ndementia with prominent association of myoclonus. CJD isinvariably fatal with mean survival of about 7 months afterdiagnosis.\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 30.2. Major Forms of CNS Diseases in AIDS.\\nDisease Incidence\\n1.

Thesechanges are predominantly seen in the cortex and othergrey matter areas. Spongiform changes result in neuronalloss and glial cell proliferation but significantly withoutany inflammation or white matter involvement.\\nFungal and Protozoal Encephalitis\\nMycotic diseases of the CNS usually develop by blood stream\\nfrom systemic deep mycoses elsewhere in the body. Theyare particularly more common in immunosuppressedindividuals such as in AIDS, patients of lymphomas andother cancers. Some of the fungi which may disseminate tothe CNS are Candida albicans, Mucor, Aspergillus fumigatus,\\nCryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum andBlastomyces dermatitidis.  These fungal infections may produce\\none of the three patterns: fungal chronic meningitis, vasculitisand encephalitis.\\nBesides fungal infections, CNS may be involved in\\nprotozoal diseases such as in malaria, toxoplasmosis,amoebiasis, trypanosomiasis and cysticerosis (Fig. 30.6) .\\nCEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES\\nCerebrovascular diseases are all those diseases in which one\\nor more of the blood vessels of the brain are involved in thepathologic processes. Various pathologic processes commonlyimplicated in cerebrovascular diseases are: thrombosis,embolism, rupture of a vessel, hypoxia, hypertensivearteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, arteritis, trauma, aneurysmand developmental malformations. These processes can resultin 2 main types of parenchymal diseases of the brain:\\nA. Ischaemic brain damage:\\na) Generalised reduction in blood flow resulting in global\\nhypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy\\nb)Local vascular obstruction causing infarcts.B\\n. Intracranial haemorrhage:\\na) Haemorrhage in the brain parenchyma (intracerebral\\nhaemorrhage)\\nb)Haemorrhage in the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid\\nhaemorrhage).\\nThe stroke syndrome  is the cardinal feature of cere-\\nbrovascular disease. The term stroke is used for sudden and\\ndramatic development of focal neurologic deficit, varying\\nfrom trivial neurologic disorder to hemiplegia and coma.\\nOther less common effects of vascular disease include:transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), vascular headache (e.g. in\\nmigraine, hypertension and arteritis), local pressure of an\\naneurysm and increased intracranial pressure (e.g. in\\nhypertensive encephalopathy and venous thrombosis).\\nA few important forms are discussed below.\\nA\\n. ISCHAEMIC BRAIN DAMAGE\\nIschaemic necrosis in the brain results from ischaemia caused\\nby considerable reduction or complete interruption of bloodsupply to neural tissue which is insufficient to meet its\\nmetabolic needs. The brain requires sufficient quantities of\\noxygen and glucose so as to sustain its aerobic metabolism,\\nmainly by citric acid (Krebs’) cycle which requires oxygen.\\nMoreover, neural tissue has limited stores of energy reservesso that cessation of continuous supply of oxygen and glucose\\nfor more than 3-4 minutes results in permanent damage to\\nneurons and neuroglial cells.\\nDeprivation of oxygen (anoxia) to the brain may occur in\\n4 different ways:\\n1.Anoxic anoxia,  in which there is low inspired pO\\n2.\\n2.Anaemic anoxia,  in which the oxygen-carrying haemo-\\nglobin is reduced.\\n3.Histotoxic anoxia,  in which there is direct toxic injury as\\noccurs in cyanide poisoning.4.Stagnant (ischaemia) anoxia,  in which the damage is caused\\nby cessation of blood with resultant local accumulation of\\nmetabolites and changes in pH.\\nIn all these different forms of anoxia, the end-result is\\nischaemic brain damage which may have one of the followingtwo patterns:\\n1.Global hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy,  resulting from\\ngeneralised cerebral hypoperfusion.2.Cerebral infarction,  resulting from severe localised\\nreduction or cessation of blood supply.\\nGlobal Hypoxic-Ischaemic Encephalopathy\\nThe brain receives 20% of cardiac output for maintaining its\\nvital aerobic metabolism. A number of factors determine the\\nmaximum length of time the CNS can survive irreversible\\nischaemic damage . These are as under:\\ni)Severity of the hypoxic episode.\\nii\\n) Presence of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease.\\niii) Age of the patient.iv) Body temperature.\\nIn normal individuals, the brain continues to be perfused\\nadequately up to systolic arterial pressure of 50 mmHg byan auto-regulatory vascular control mechanism. However,\\nFigure 30.6 Neurocysticercosis. The sliced surface of the cerebral\\nhemisphere of the brain shows may tiny whitish nodules and cysts about\\n1 cm in diameter.880SECTION III Systemic Pathologyfall of systemic arterial systolic pressure below this critical\\nvalue results in rapid fall in cerebral perfusion pressure andeventual ischaemic encephalopathy. Such types of medicalemergencies occur at the time of cardiac arrest followed byrelatively delayed resuscitation, severe episode of hypo-tension, carbon monoxide intoxication and status epilepticus.Hypoxic encephalopathy may be followed by a post-ischaemic confusional state and complete recovery or a stateof coma and even a persistent vegetative life and brain death.\\nDepending upon the proneness of different cells of the\\nbrain to the effects of ischaemia-hypoxia, three types of lesionmay occur:\\n1. Selective neuronal damage:  Neurons are most vulnerable\\nto damaging effect of ischaemia-hypoxia and irreversible\\ninjury. In particular, oligodendroglial cells are mostsusceptible, followed by astrocytes while microglial cells andvascular endothelium survive the longest. The reason forundue vulnerability of neurons to hypoxia can be explainedby various factors:i) Different cerebral circulatory blood flow.ii) Presence of acidic excitatory neurotransmitters calledexcitotoxins.iii) Excessive metabolic requirement of these neurons.iv) Increased sensitivity of neurons to lactic acid.\\n2. Laminar necrosis:  Global ischaemia of cerebral cortex\\nresults in uneven damage because of different cerebral\\nvasculature which is termed laminar or pseudolaminarnecrosis. In this, superficial areas of cortical layers escapedamage while deeper layers are necrosed.\\n3. Watershed infarcts:  Circulatory flow in the brain by\\nanterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries has\\noverlapping circulations. In ischaemia-hypoxia, perfusion ofoverlapping zones, being farthest from the blood supply,suffers maximum damage. This results in wedge-shapedareas of coagulative necrosis called watershed or borderzoneinfarcts. Particularly vulnerable is the border zone of thecerebral cortex between the anterior and middle cerebralarteries, producing para-sagittal infarction.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The pathologic appear-\\nance of the brain in hypoxic encephalopathy variesdepending upon the duration and severity of hypoxicepisode and the length of survival.\\nSurvival for a few hours:  No pathologic changes are\\nvisible.\\nSurvival 12-24 hours:  No macroscopic change is\\ndiscernible but microscopic examination reveals earlyneuronal damage in the form of eosinophilic cytoplasmand pyknotic nuclei, so called red neurons.\\nAfter 2-7 days: Grossly,  there is focal softening. The\\narea supplied by distal branches of the cerebral arteriessuffers from the most severe ischaemic damage and maydevelop border  zone or watershed infarcts  in the junctional\\nzones between the territories supplied by major arteries.\\nMicroscopically,  the nerve cells die and disappear and\\nare replaced by reactive fibrillary gliosis. There are minor\\nvariations in the distribution of neuronal damage to thecortex; the loss of pyramidal cell layer is more severe thanthat of granular cell layer producing laminar necrosis.\\nLonger duration:  Use of modern ventilators has led\\nto maintenance of cardiorespiratory function in the\\npresence of total brain necrosis unassociated with vital\\nreaction.\\nCerebral Infarction\\nCerebral infarction is a localised area of tissue necrosis caused\\nby local vascular occlusion—arterial or venous. Occasionally,it may be the result of non-occlusive causes such ascompression on the cerebral arteries from outside and fromhypoxic encephalopathy. Clinically, the signs and symptomsassociated with cerebral infarction depend upon the regioninfarcted. In general, the focal neurologic deficit termedstroke, is present. However, significant atheroscleroticcerebrovascular disease may produce transient ischaemicattacks (TIA).\\n1. Arterial occlusion.  Occlusion of the cerebral arteries by\\neither thrombi or emboli is the most common cause of\\ncerebral infarction. Thrombotic occlusion of the cerebralarteries is most frequently the result of atherosclerosis, andrarely, from arteritis of the cranial arteries. Embolic arterialocclusion is commonly derived from the heart, most oftenfrom mural thrombosis complicating myocardial infarction,from atrial fibrillation and endocarditis. The size and shapeof an infarct are determined by the extent of anastomoticconnections with adjacent arterial branches as under:\\nCircle of Willis provides a complete collateral flow for\\ninternal carotid and vertebral arteries.\\nMiddle and anterior cerebral arteries have partial\\nanastomosis of their distal branches. Their complete\\nocclusion may cause infarcts.\\nSmall terminal cerebral arteries, on the contrary, are end-\\narteries and have no anastomosis. Hence, occlusion of these\\nbranches will invariably lead to an infarct.\\n2. Venous occlusion.  Venous infarction in the brain is an\\ninfrequent phenomenon due to good communications of the\\ncerebral venous drainage. However in cancer, due to\\nincreased predisposition to thrombosis, superior sagittalthrombosis may occur leading to bilateral, parasagittal,multiple haemorrhagic infarcts.\\n3. Non-occlusive causes.  Compression of the cerebral arte-\\nries from outside such as occurs during herniation may cause\\ncerebral infarction. Mechanism of watershed (border zone)cerebral infarction in hypoxic encephalopathy has already\\nbeen explained above.\\nIn any case, the extent of damage produced by any of the\\nabove causes depends upon:\\ni)rate of reduction of blood flow;\\nii\\n) type of blood vessel involved; and\\niii) extent of collateral circulation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  cerebral infarcts\\nmay be anaemic or haemorrhagic. An anaemic infarct881CHAPTER 30 The Nervous Systembecomes evident 6-12 hours after its occurrence. The\\naffected area is soft and swollen and there is blurring ofjunction between grey and white matter. Within 2-3 days,the infarct undergoes softening and disintegration.Eventually, there is central liquefaction with peripheralfirm glial reaction and thickened leptomeninges, forminga cystic infarct (Fig. 30.7) . A haemorrhagic infarct  is red and\\nsuperficially resembles a haematoma. It is usually theresult of fragmentation of occlusive arterial emboli orvenous thrombosis.Histologically,  the sequential changes are as under:\\n1.Initially, there is eosinophilic neuronal necrosis and\\nlipid vacuolisation produced by breakdown of myelin.Simultaneously, the infarcted area is infiltrated byneutrophils.2. After the first 2-3 days, there is progressive invasionby macrophages and there is astrocytic and vascularproliferation.3. In the following weeks to months, the macrophagesclear away the necrotic debris by phagocytosis followedby reactive astrocytosis, often with little fine fibrosis(Fig. 30.8) . A haemorrhagic infarct has some phagocytes\\ncontaining haemosiderin.4.Ultimately, after 3-4 months an old cystic infarct is\\nformed which shows a cyst traversed by small bloodvessels and has peripheral fibrillary gliosis. Small cavi-tary infarcts are called lacunar infarcts  and are commonly\\nfound as a complication of systemic hypertension.\\nB. INTRACRANIAL HAEMORRHAGE\\nHaemorrhage into the brain may be traumatic, non-trau-\\nmatic, or spontaneous. There are two main types ofspontaneous intracranial haemorrhage:\\n1.Intracerebral haemorrhage, which is usually of hyper-\\ntensive origin.2. Subarachnoid haemorrhage, which is commonly aneu-\\nrysmal in origin.\\nIn addition to hypertension and rupture of an aneurysm,\\nother causes of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhageinclude vascular malformations which produce mixedintracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage, haemorrhagicdiathesis and haemorrhage into tumours.Intracerebral Haemorrhage\\nSpontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage occurs mostly in\\npatients of hypertension. Most hypertensives over middleage have microaneurysms in very small cerebral arteries inthe brain tissue. Rupture of one of the numerousmicroaneurysms is believed to be the cause of intracerebralhaemorrhage. Unlike subarachnoid haemorrhage, it is notcommon to have recurrent intracerebral haemorrhages.\\nThe common sites of hypertensive intracerebral haemor-\\nrhage are the region of the basal ganglia (particularly theputamen and the internal capsule), pons and the cerebellarcortex. Clinically the onset is usually sudden with headacheand loss of consciousness. Depending upon the location ofthe lesion, hemispheric, brainstem or cerebellar signs willbe present. About 40% of patients die during the first 3-4days of haemorrhage, mostly from haemorrhage into theventricles. The survivors tend to have haematoma thatseparates the tissue planes which is followed by resolutionand development of an apoplectic cyst  accompanied by loss\\nof function.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly  and micros-\\ncopically , the haemorrhage consists of dark mass of\\nclotted blood replacing brain parenchyma. The bordersof the lesion are sharply-defined and have a narrow rimof partially necrotic parenchyma. Small ring haemor-rhages in the Virchow-Robin space in the border zone arecommonly present. Ipsilateral ventricles are distorted andcompressed and may contain blood in their lumina.Rarely, blood may rupture through the surface of the braininto the subarachnoid space. After a few weeks to months,the haematoma undergoes resolution with formation of aFigure 30.7 An old cystic infarct in the brain (coronal section). There\\nis shrinkage of scarred area with ipsilateral ventricular dilatation.\\nFigure 30.8 An anaemic infarct of a few days duration. The histologic\\nchanges are reactive astrocytosis, a few reactive macrophages and\\nneovascularisation in the wall of the cystic lesion. The outer cortical layeris, however, intact.\\n882SECTION III Systemic Pathologyslit-like space called apoplectic cyst which contains\\nyellowish fluid. Its margins are yellow-brown and have\\nhaemosiderin-laden macrophages and a reactive zone offibrillary astrocytosis.\\nSubarachnoid Haemorrhage\\nHaemorrhage into the subarachnoid space is most comm-\\nonly caused by rupture of an aneurysm, and rarely, ruptureof a vascular malformation.\\nA general discussion of aneurysms is given on page 405.\\nOf the three types of aneurysms affecting the largerintracranial arteries—berry, mycotic and fusiform, berryaneurysms are most important and most common.\\nBERRY ANEURYSMS are saccular in appearance with\\nrounded or lobulated bulge arising at the bifurcation of\\nintracranial arteries and varying in size from 2 mm to 2 cmor more. They account for 95% of aneurysms which are liableto rupture. Berry aneurysms are rare in childhood butincrease in frequency in young adults and middle life. Theyare, therefore, not congenital anomalies but develop over theyears from developmental defect of the media of the arterialwall at the bifurcation of arteries forming thin-walled saccu-lar bulges. Although most berry aneurysms are sporadic inoccurrence, there is an increased incidence of their presencein association with congenital polycystic kidney disease andcoarctation of the aorta. About a quarter of berry aneurysmsare multiple.\\nIn more than 85% cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage,\\nthe cause is massive and sudden bleeding from a berryaneurysm on or near the circle of Willis. The four mostcommon sites are as under (Fig. 30.9):\\n1. In relation to anterior communicating artery.2.At the origin of the posterior communicating artery from\\nthe stem of the internal carotid artery.3. At the first major bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery.4.At the bifurcation of the internal carotid into the middle\\nand anterior cerebral arteries.The remaining 15% cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage\\nare the result of rupture in the posterior circulation, vascularmalformations and rupture of mycotic aneurysms that occursin the setting of bacterial endocarditis. In all types ofaneurysms, the rupture of thin-walled dilatation occurs inassociation with sudden rise in intravascular pressure butchronic hypertension does not appear to be a risk factor intheir development or rupture.\\nClinically,  berry aneurysms remain asymptomatic prior\\nto rupture. On rupture, they produce severe generalised\\nheadache of sudden onset which is frequently followed by\\nunconsciousness and neurologic defects. Initial mortality\\nfrom first rupture is about 20-25%. Survivors recover\\ncompletely but frequently suffer from recurrent episodes of\\nfresh bleeding.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Rupture of a berry aneu-\\nrysm frequently spreads haemorrhage throughout the\\nsubarachnoid space with rise in intracranial pressure andcharacteristic blood-stained CSF. An intracerebralhaematoma may develop if the blood tracks into the brainparenchyma. The region of the brain supplied by theaffected artery frequently shows infarction, partlyattributed to vasospasm.\\nTRAUMA\\n TO THE CNS\\nTrauma to the CNS constitutes an important cause of deathand permanent disability in the modern world. Importantcauses of head injuries are: motor vehicle accidents,accidental falls and violence. Traumatic injuries to the CNSmay result in three consequences which may occur inisolation or in combination:\\nepidural haematoma;\\nsubdural haematoma; and\\nparenchymal brain damage.\\nA. Epidural Haematoma\\nEpidural haematoma is accumulation of blood between the\\ndura and the skull following fracture of the skull, mostcommonly from rupture of middle meningeal artery. Thehaematoma expands rapidly since accumulating blood isarterial in origin and causes compression of the dura andflattening of underlying gyri (Fig. 30.10) . The patient\\ndevelops progressive loss of consciousness if haematoma isnot drained early.\\nB. Subdural Haematoma\\nSubdural haematoma is accumulation of blood between the\\ndura and subarachnoid and develops most often fromrupture of veins which cross the surface convexities of thecerebral hemispheres. Subdural haematoma may be acuteor chronic.\\nAcute subdural haematoma.  Acute subdural haematoma\\ndevelops following trauma and consists of clotted blood,often in the frontoparietal region. There is no significantcompression of gyri (Fig. 30.11) . Since the accumulated blood\\nis of venous origin, symptoms appear slowly and maybecome chronic with passage of time if not fatal.\\nFigure 30.9 The circle of Willis showing principal sites of berry\\n(saccular) aneurysms. The serial numbers indicate the frequency of\\ninvolvement.\\n883CHAPTER 30 The Nervous SystemChronic subdural haematoma.  Chronic subdural haema-\\ntoma occurs often with brain atrophy and less commonly\\nfollowing trauma. Chronic subdural haematoma is composedof liquid blood. Separating the haematoma from underlyingbrain is a membrane composed of granulation tissue.\\nC. Parenchymal Brain Damage\\nTrauma to the CNS may result in damage to brain paren-\\nchyma and includes the following forms:\\n1. Concussion.  Concussion is caused by closed head injury\\nand is characterised by transient neurologic dysfunction and\\nloss of consciousness. Invariably, there is complete neurologicrecovery after some hours to days.\\nNo significant morphologic change is noticed but moresevere concussion may cause diffuse axonal injury(discussed below).\\n2. Diffuse axonal  injury.  Diffuse axonal injury is the most\\ncommon cause of persistent coma or vegetative statefollowing head injury. The underlying cause is suddenangular acceleration or deceleration resulting in widespreadaxonal shearing in the deep white matter of both thehemispheres.\\nGrossly,  the changes are minimal to small multiple\\nhaemorrhages.\\n3. Contusions and lacerations.  Contusions and lacerations\\nare the result of direct damage to the brain parenchyma,particularly cerebral hemispheres, as occurs in the softtissues. Most often, they are the result of blunt trauma. Theoverlying skull may or may not be fractured. Traumaticsubarachnoid haemorrhage invariably accompanies cerebralcontusions.\\nMicroscopically,  brain parenchyma at the affected site is\\nhaemorrhagic, necrotic and fragmented. On healing, theselesions appear as shrunken areas with golden brownhaemosiderin pigment on the surface.4. Traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage.  On trauma to the\\nCNS, the parenchymal vessels of the hemispheres may gettorn and cause multiple intracerebral haemorrhages.\\n5. Brain swelling.  Head injury may be accompanied by\\nlocalised or diffuse brain swelling.\\nDEMYELINATING DISEASES\\nDemyelinating diseases are an important group of\\nneurological disorders which have, in common, the\\npathologic features of focal or patchy destruction of myelinsheaths in the CNS accompanied by an inflammatoryresponse. Demyelination may affect peripheral nervoussystem as well. Some degree of axonal damage may alsooccur but demyelination is the predominant feature. The\\nexact cause for demyelination is not known but currently\\nviral infection and autoimmunity are implicated in itspathogenesis.\\nLoss of myelin may occur in certain other conditions as\\nwell, but without an inflammatory response. Theseconditions have known etiologies such as: genetically-\\ndetermined defects in the myelin metabolism (leucodys-\\ntrophies), slow virus diseases of oligodendrocytes (pro-gressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy), and exposure totoxins (central pontine myelinolysis). All these entities arecurrently not classified as demyelinating diseases. Only thoseconditions in which the myelin sheath or the myelin-forming\\ncells (i.e. oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells) are primarily\\ninjured and are associated with considerable inflammatoryexudate are included under the term ‘demyelinatingdiseases’. Pathologically and clinically, two demyelinatingdiseases are distinguished:1.Multiple or disseminated sclerosis\\n2. Perivenous encephalomyelitis.\\nMultiple (Disseminated) Sclerosis\\nMultiple or disseminated sclerosis is the most common of\\nthe CNS demyelinating diseases. The usual age at onset is20 to 40 years. The disease presents as recurrent attacks offocal neurologic disorder with predilection for involvementFigure 30.10 Epidural haematoma often results from rupture of\\nartery following skull fracture resulting in accumulation of arterial blood\\nbetween the skull and the dura.Figure 30.11 Subdural haematoma often results from rupture of\\nveins crossing the cerebral convexities and is characterised byaccumulation of venous blood between the dura and the arachnoid.\\n884SECTION III Systemic Pathologyof the spinal cord, optic nerve and brain. The first attack\\nusually begins with a single sign or symptom, mostcommonly optic neuritis, followed by recovery. As thedisease becomes more progressive, remissions becomeinfrequent and incomplete. The etiology of multiple sclerosisremains unknown but a role for genetic susceptibility,infectious agent and immunologic mechanism has beenproposed.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  The pathologic hallmark\\nis the presence of many scattered discrete areas ofdemyelination termed plaques.\\nGrossly,  plaques appear as grey-pink, swollen, sharply\\ndefined, usually bilaterally symmetric areas in the whitematter.\\nMicroscopically,  the features vary according to the age\\nof the plaque:\\n1. ln active enlarging plaques , the histologic features are\\naccumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages around\\nvenules and at the plaque margin where demyelinationis occurring. In addition, there is loss of oligodendrocytesand presence of reactive astrocytosis with numerous lipid-laden macrophages (microglia) in the plaque. The axonsin the plaque are generally intact.\\n2. In old inactive plaques,  there is no perivascular inflam-\\nmatory cell infiltrate and nearly total absence of\\noligodendrocytes. Demyelination in the plaque area iscomplete as there is only limited regeneration of myelin.Gliosis is well-developed but astrocytes are lessprominent. Some axonal loss may be present.\\nPerivenous Encephalomyelitis\\nPerivenous encephalomyelitis includes two uncommon\\ndiseases: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis  and acute\\nnecrotising haemorrhagic leucoencephalitis.  Both are monophasic\\ndiseases characterised by perivenous mononuclearinflammatory cell infiltration. Both diseases occur followinga viral infection, vaccination or a respiratory illness. Boththese conditions are looked upon as human counterpart ofexperimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and areconsidered to be allergic reaction against myelin antigen.\\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis  occurs usually\\nfollowing viral infection (measles, mumps, rubella,chickenpox), whooping cough or vaccination. The diseasebegins abruptly with headache and delirium followed bylethargy and coma. Signs of meningeal irritation and fevermay be present. Prognosis for recovery is generally good.\\nAcute necrotising haemorrhagic leucoencephalitis  is a\\nrare disease occurring more often after a respiratory infection.The clinical course is similar to that of acute disseminatedencephalomyelitis except for its suddenness of onset andrapidity of progression, sometimes leading to death within48 hours.\\nMISCELLANEOUS DISEASES\\nIncluded under the heading of miscellaneous diseases of the\\nCNS are degenerative, metabolic and nutritional diseases.These groups along with the list of diseases included in eachgroup are briefly outlined below without going into thedetails of individual diseases for which the interested reader\\nmay consult pertinent text on neuropathology and neurology.\\nDegenerative Diseases\\nDegenerative diseases are disorders of unknown etiology\\nand pathogenesis, characterised pathologically by prog-ressive loss of CNS neurons and their processes accom-panied by fibrillary astrocytosis. The identification of thesediseases depends upon exclusion of diseases with known\\netiologies such as metabolic disturbances, vascular\\ndiseases, nutritional deficiencies or infection. A consider-able proportion of degenerative disorders are genetic inorigin, with either dominant or recessive inheritance;others occur sporadically. Family history is, of course, ofgreat importance.\\nThe degenerative disorders usually begin insidiously and\\nhave a gradual progressive course over many years. In\\nvirtually all cases, the lesions have characteristic bilaterallysymmetric distribution. Another striking characteristic of thedegenerative disorders is that particular anatomic orphysiologic system of neurons may be selectively affected,leaving others entirely intact.\\nClassification of degenerative diseases into individual\\nsyndromes is based on clinical aspects and anatomicdistribution of the lesions. Some of the more commondegenerative diseases are listed in Table 30.3 . Two of the\\nimportant examples—Alzheimer’s disease and parkin-sonism, are considered below.\\nALZHEIMER’S DISEASE.  Alzheimer’s disease is the most\\ncommon cause of dementia in the elderly. The condition\\noccurs after 5th decade of life and its incidence progressivelyincreases with advancing age. The exact cause is not knownbut a few factors are implicated in its etiology which includepositive family history and deposition of A β amyloid derived\\nfrom amyloid precursor protein (APP) forming neuritic ‘senile’\\nplaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\\nGrossly,  the brain is often reduced in weight and\\nbilaterally atrophic.Microscopically,  the main features are as under:\\ni)Senile neuritic plaque  is the most conspicuous lesion and\\nconsists of focal area which has a central core containingAβ amyloid.\\nii)Neurofibrillary tangle  is a filamentous collection of\\nneurofilaments and neurotubules within the cytoplasmof neurons.iii)Amyloid angiopathy  is deposition of the same amyloid\\nin the vessel wall which is deposited in the amyloid coreof the plaque.iv)Granulovacuolar degeneration  is presence of multiple,\\nsmall intraneuronal cytoplasmic vacuoles, some of whichcontain one or more dark granules called Hirano bodies.\\nPARKINSONISM.  Parkinsonism is a syndrome of chronic\\nprogressive disorder of motor function and is clinicallycharacterised by tremors which are most conspicuous at restand worsen with emotional stress; other features are rigidity885CHAPTER 30 The Nervous Systemand disordered gait and posture. Parkinsonism is caused by\\nseveral degenerative diseases, the most important beingParkinson’s disease; other causes of parkinsonism aretrauma, toxic agents, and drugs (dopamine antagonists).\\nGrossly,  the brain is atrophic or may be normal externally.\\nMicroscopically,  the hallmark is depigmentation of\\nsubstantia nigra and locus ceruleus due to loss ofneuromelanin pigment from neurons and accumulationof neuromelanin pigment in the glial cells. Some of theresidual neurons in these areas contain intracytoplasmic,eosinophilic, elongated inclusions called Lewy bodies.\\nMetabolic Diseases\\nMetabolic diseases of the CNS result from neurochemical\\ndisturbances which are either inherited or acquired.\\nHereditary metabolic disorders  predominantly manifest in\\ninfancy or childhood and include genetically-determineddisorders of carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid and mineral\\nmetabolism. Acquired or secondary metabolic diseases  are the\\ndisturbances of cerebral function due to disease in some other\\norgan system such as the heart and circulation, lungs andrespiratory function, kidneys, liver, endocrine glands and\\npancreas. In addition, endogenous metabolic diseases may\\nbe caused by toxic injuries induced by metals, gases,chemicals, and drugs. The pathologic changes in each of theseconditions are quite diverse and include oedema, neuronal\\nstorage, degenerative changes, and sometimes parenchymal\\nnecrosis.\\nThe predomin ant types of hereditary and acquired\\nmetabolic disorders are as under:A.HEREDITARY METABOLIC DISEASES:\\n1\\n. Neuronal storage diseases —characterised by storage of\\na metabolic product in the neurons due to specific enzyme\\ndeficiency. Common examples are: gangliosidoses (e.g.Tay-Sachs disease or GM2 gangliosidosis),  mucopoly\\n-\\nsaccharidoses, Gaucher’s disease and Niemann-Pickdisease). These conditions are described on page 262.\\n2. Leucodystrophies —are diseases of white matter charac-\\nterised by diffuse demyelination and gliosis. They are caused\\nby deficiency of one of the enzymes required for formationand maintenance of myelin. That is why these conditionsare also called dysmyelinating diseases.  Common types of\\nleucodystrophies are: sudanophilic leucodystrophy,adrenoleucodystrophy, metachromatic leucodystrophy andgloboid cell leucodystrophy (Krabbe’s disease).\\n3. Other inborn errors of metabolism —e.g. Wilson’s\\ndisease (hepatolenticular degeneration), glycogen-storage\\ndiseases, phenylketonuria and galactosaemia.\\nB. ACQUIRED METABOLIC DISEASES:\\nThese include the following:\\n1.Anoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy\\n2.Hypoglycaemic encephalopathy\\n3.\\nHyperglycaemic coma\\n4. Acute hepatic encephalopathy (Reye’s syndrome)5. Chronic hepatic encephalopathy6. Kernicterus7. Uraemic encephalopathy8.

In the United States and Europe,however, nutritionally-induced disease is chiefly found inassociation with chronic alcoholism or due to defect inabsorption, transport or metabolism of dietary nutrients.\\nThe general aspects of deficiency diseases have been\\ncovered in Chapter 9.

Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord(vitamin B\\n12 deficiency).\\n3. Folic acid deficiency (page 304).4. Spinocerebellar syndrome (vitamin E deficiency).5. Pellagra (niacin deficiency).6. Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration.\\nTUMOURS OF THE CNS\\nTumours of the CNS may originate in the brain or spinal\\ncord (primary tumours), or may spread to the brain fromanother primary site of cancer (metastatic tumours). Morethan one-quarter of the CNS tumours are secondary meta-stases arising in patients undergoing treatment for systemiccancer. Primary CNS tumours are the second commonestform of cancer in infants and children under the age of 15years, exceeded in frequency only by leukaemia. Both benignand malignant CNS tumours are capable of producingneurologic impairment depending upon their site.\\nPrimary CNS tumours or intracranial tumours include:\\ntumours arising from constituent cells of the brain  (with the\\nsole exception of microglial cells) and from the supporting\\ntissues.  Childhood  brain tumours arise from more primitive\\ncells (e.g. neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma).\\nA classification of intracranial tumours abbreviated from\\nthe WHO classification is given in Table 30.4 . The anatomic\\ndistribution of common intracranial tumours is illustratedin Fig.\\n 30.12 . Among the primary brain tumours, gliomas\\nconstitute 50-60%, meningiomas 25%, schwannomas 10%and other primary tumours comprise the remainder.\\nSome of the important morphologic types are described\\nbelow.\\nGLIOMAS\\nThe term glioma is used for all tumours arising from\\nneuroglia, or more precisely, from neuroectodermal epithelialtissue. Gliomas are the most common of the primary CNStumours and collectively account for 40% of all intracranialtumours. They include tumours arising:\\nfrom astrocytes  (astrocytomas and glioblastoma\\nmultiforme);\\nfrom  oligodendrocytes  (oligodendroglioma);\\nfrom ependyma  (ependymoma); and\\nfrom choroid plexus  (choroid plexus papilloma).Gliomas may be well-differentiated or poorly-differen-\\ntiated. However, gliomas are never truly well-demarcatedor encapsulated and thus all grades of gliomas infiltrate theadjacent brain tissue.  Gliomas are disseminated to otherparts of the CNS by CSF but they rarely ever metastasisebeyond the CNS.Figure 30.12 The anatomic distribution of common intracranial\\ntumours.\\n\\uf075\\uf075 TABLE 30.4: Classification of Intracranial Tumours.\\nI.

METASTATIC TUMOURS\\n887CHAPTER 30 The Nervous SystemAstrocytomas (including Glioblastoma Multiforme)\\nAstrocytomas are the most common type of gliomas. In\\ngeneral, they are found in the late middle life with a peak in6th decade of life. They occur predominantly in the cerebral\\nhemispheres, and occasionally in the spinal cord. In children\\nand young adults, pilocytic astrocytomas arise in the opticnerves, cerebellum and brainstem. Astrocytomas havetendency to progress from low grade to higher grades of\\nanaplasia. Low-grade astrocytomas evolve slowly over\\nseveral years whereas higher grades (anaplastic astrocytomaand glioblastoma multiforme) bring about rapid clinicaldeterioration of the patient.\\nThe diagnosis of various types of astrocytomas can be\\ngenerally made by routine H & E morphology but in difficult\\nsituations and poorly differentiated cases, immunohisto-chemical staining with glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) or byelectron microscopic demonstration of glial filaments can bedone.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.  Pathologically, astrocyto-\\nmas have been conventionally divided into 3 progressive\\nhistologic grades: fibrillary (most common), gemistocyticand protoplasmic. However, currently WHO classification\\nof astrocytomas is widely used which divides them into 4\\ngrades from grade I (low grade)  to grade IV (glioblastomamultiforme) as under.\\nWHO GRADE I ASTROCYTOMA. Also called as diffuse\\nastrocytoma, it is a low-grade tumour having good\\nprognosis and includes special histologic entities which\\nmainly occur in children as under:\\ni) Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma.  It occur in children and\\nyoung adults in the cerebellum, third ventricle and optic\\nnerve pathway.Grossly,  it is usually cystic or solid and circumscribed.\\nMicroscopically,  it is predominantly composed of\\nfusiform pilocytic astrocytes having unusually long, wavy\\nfibrillary processes.ii) Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.  It looks histologically\\npleomrphic and alarming but has favourable prognosis.\\nWHO GRADE II  (WELL-DIFFERENTIATED)  ASTRO-\\nCYTOMA.  It is also called as fibrillary astrocytoma and\\nis the most common form of glioma occurring in 3rd to\\n4th decades of life.\\nGrossly,  it is a poorly defined, grey-white tumour of\\nvariable size. The tumour distorts the underlying brain\\ntissue and merges with the surrounding tissue.\\nHistologically,  it is composed of well-differentiated\\nastrocytes separated by variable amount of fibrillary\\nbackground of astrocytic processes. Based on the type ofastrocytes, three subtypes are distinguished: fibrillary,\\nprotoplastic  and gemistocytic astrocytoma.\\nWHO GRADE III (ANAPLASTIC) ASTROCYTOMA.\\nIt generally evolves from lower grade of astrocytoma.\\nGrossly,  it may not be distinguishable from the low-grade\\nastrocytoma.\\nHistologically,  it contains features of anaplasia such as\\nhypercellularity, pleomorphism, nuclear hyper-\\nchromatism and mitoses. Another characteristic featureof anaplastic variety of astrocytoma is the proliferation ofvascular endothelium (Fig. 30.13) .\\nWHO GRADE IV ASTROCYTOMA (GLIOBLAS-TOMA MULTIFORME). Although its nomenclature\\nmeans its origin from embryonal cells but now it isknown that this tumour arises by neoplastic transfor-mation of mature astrocytes. It is the most aggressive ofastrocytomas.\\nGrossly,  it shows variegated appearance, with some areas\\nshowing grey-white appearance while others are yellow\\nand soft with foci of haemorrhages and necrosis. Thesurrounding normal brain tissue is distorted andinfiltrated by yellow tumour tissue.Figure 30.13 Anaplastic astrocytoma, showing hypercellularity of pleomorphic astrocytic cells, mitoses and vascular proliferation in fibrill ary\\nbackground. Areas of necrosis are also present.\\n888SECTION III Systemic PathologyHistologically,  the features are as under (Fig. 30.14) :\\ni) It has highly anaplastic and cellular appearance. The\\ncell types show marked variation consisting of fusiform\\ncells, small poorly-differentiated round cells, pleomorphiccells and giant cells. Mitoses are quite frequent and glial\\nfibrils are scanty.\\nii) It shows areas of tumour necrosis around which\\ntumour cells may form pseudopalisading.iii)\\nMicrovascular endothelial proliferation is marked.\\nOligodendroglioma\\nOligodendroglioma is an uncommon glioma of oligo-\\ndendroglial origin and may develop in isolation or may bemixed with other glial cells. The tumour commonly presentsin 3rd to 4th decades of life. It occurs in the cerebral\\nhemispheres, most commonly in the frontal lobes or within\\nthe ventricles. X-ray examination and CT scan reveal a well-\\ndefined mass with numerous small foci of calcification. Thetumour is generally slow-growing.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  oligodendro-\\nglioma is well-circumscribed, grey-white and gelatinousmass having cystic areas, foci of haemorrhages andcalcification.Microscopically,  the tumour is characterised by uniform\\ncells with round to oval nuclei surrounded by a clear haloof cytoplasm and well-defined cell membranes.  Tumourcells tend  to cluster around the native neurons formingsatellitosis.  Typically, there are varying degree of endo-\\nthelial cell hyperplasia and foci of calcification. Anaplasticchange may occur as in other gliomas.\\nEpendymoma\\nEpendymoma is not an uncommon tumour, derived from\\nthe layer of epithelium that lines the ventricles and the central\\ncanal of the spinal cord. It occurs chiefly in children and\\nyoung adults (below 20 years of age). Typically, it isencountered in the fourth ventricle (posterior fossa tumour).Other locations are the lateral ventricles, the third ventricle,\\nand in the case of adults, the spinal cord in the region of\\nlumbar spine. Clinically, by virtue of their frequent locationin the floor of the fourth ventricle, ependymomas are asso-ciated with obstructive hydrocephalus. The usual biologic\\nbehaviour is of a slow-growing tumour over a period of years.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  ependymoma is\\na well-demarcated tumour but complete surgical removal\\nmay not be possible due to close proximity to vital\\nstructures in the medulla and pons.\\nMicroscopically,  the tumour is composed of uniform\\nepithelial (ependymal) cells forming rosettes, canals andperivascular pseudorosettes. By light microscopy underhigh magnification, PTAH- positive structures, blepharo-\\nplasts, representing basal bodies of cilia may be\\ndemonstrated in the cytoplasm of tumour cells (Fig. 30.15) .Figure 30.14 Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV astrocytoma).\\nThe tumour is densely cellular having marked pleomorphism.\\nCharacteristically, the tumour has areas of necrosis which are surroundedby a palisade layer of tumour cells.\\nFigure 30.15\\nEpendymoma showing uniform ependymal tumour cells forming rosettes and canaliculi.\\n889CHAPTER 30 The Nervous SystemMost tumours are well-differentiated but anaplastic\\nvariants are also recognised.\\nTwo variants of ependymoma deserve special\\nmention: myxopapillary type and subependymoma.\\nMyxopapillary ependymoma.  It is a special variant of\\nependymoma which is common and occurs in adults.\\nCharacteristically, it occurs in the region of cauda equinaand originates from the filum terminale. True to its name,it contains myxoid and papillary structures interspersedin the typical ependymal cells. It is a slow-growing tumourhaving a better prognosis.\\nSubependymoma.  It occurs as a small, asymptomatic,\\nincidental solid nodule in the fourth and lateral ventricle\\nof middle-aged or elderly patients. Areas of microcystsand calcification may be encountered.\\nHistologically,  it is composed of nests of uniform\\nependymal cells in a stroma of very dense, acellular, finely\\nfibrillar background. Subependymoma is typically a veryslow-growing tumour.\\nChoroid Plexus Papilloma\\nTumours derived from choroid plexus epithelium are\\nuncommon intracranial tumours. They are found in thedistribution of the choroid plexus. In children, they occurmost frequently in the lateral ventricles, whereas in adultsfourth ventricle is the most common site. They are invariablybenign tumours and rarely ever undergo malignanttransformation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour\\nprojects as rounded, papillary mass into one of theventricles.Histologically,  choroid plexus papilloma is a papillary\\ntumour resembling normal choroid plexus with a vascularconnective tissue core covered by a single layer of cuboidalepithelium which lies upon a basement membrane.\\nPOORLY-DIFFERENTIATED ANDEMBR YONAL  TUMOURS\\nCNS tumours composed of primitive undifferentiated cellsinclude medulloblastoma and glioblastoma, and rarely,neuroblastoma (page 800) and retinoblastoma (page 512).Except for medulloblastoma, other examples of thesetumours have been described elsewhere in the text.\\nMedulloblastoma\\nMedulloblastoma is the most common variety of primitive\\nneuroectodermal tumour. It comprises 25% of all childhoodbrain tumours but a quarter of cases occur in patients overthe age of 20 years. The most common location is thecerebellum in the region of roof of fourth ventricle, in themidline of cerebellum, in the vermis, and in the cerebellarhemispheres. Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant tumourand spreads to local as well as to distant sites. It invadeslocally and by the CSF to meninges, ventricles andsubarachnoid space and has a tendency for widespreadmetastases to extraneural sites such as to lungs, liver,vertebrae and pelvis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour typi-\\ncally protrudes into the fourth ventricle as a soft, grey-white mass or invades the surface of the cerebellum.Microscopically,  medulloblastoma is composed of small,\\npoorly-differentiated cells with ill-defined cytoplasmicprocesses and a tendency to be arranged around bloodvessels and occasionally forms pseudorosettes (Homer-Wright rosettes). Another characteristic of the tumour isdifferentiation into glial or neuronal elements.\\nOTHER PRIMAR\\nY INTRAPARENCHYMAL TUMOURS\\nImportant examples of some other primary  intraparen-chymal are haemangioblastoma, CNS lymphoma and germcell tumours.\\nHaemangioblastoma\\nHaemangioblastoma is a tumour of uncertain origin and\\nconstitutes about 2% of all intracranial tumours. It is seen\\nmore commonly in young adults and is commoner in males.\\nIt may occur sporadically or be a part of von Hippel-Lindausyndrome (along with cysts in the liver, kidney, and benign/malignant renal tumour). About a quarter of haemangio-\\nblastomas secrete erythropoietin and cause polycythaemia.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nusually a circumscribed cystic mass with a mural nodule.\\nThe cyst contains haemorrhagic fluid.Microscopically,  the features are as under:\\ni) Large number of thin-walled blood vessels lined by\\nplump endothelium.\\nii) Vascular spaces are separated by groups of polygonallipid-laden foamy stromal cells.\\nPrimary CNS Lymphoma\\nLymphomas in the brain may occur as a part of disseminated\\nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Chapter 14) or may be a primaryCNS lymphoma. The incidence of the primary CNSlymphoma has shown a rising  trend in patients of AIDS\\nand other immunosuppressed conditions. They occur in men\\nabove 5th decade of life. Primary CNS lymphoma has a poorprognosis.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour is\\nfrequently periventricular in location and may appearnodular or diffuse.\\nMicroscopically, the features are as under:\\ni) Characteristically, the tumour grows around blood\\nvessels i.e. has an angiocentric growth pattern. Reticulinstain highlights this feature well.\\nii) Typically, CNS lymphomas are diffuse, large cell type\\nwith high mitotic activity.iii) They are generally β-cell type.890SECTION III Systemic PathologyGerm Cell Tumours\\nRarely, germ cell tumours may occur in the brain, especially\\nin children. Common locations are suprasellar region and\\npineal area. Some common examples of such tumours are\\ngerminoma (seminoma/dysgerminoma), teratoma and\\nembryonal carcinoma. Morphologically, they are similar to\\ntheir counterparts elsewhere.\\nTUMOURS OF MENINGES\\nThe most common tumour arising from the pia-arachnoid is\\nmeningioma accounting for 20% of intracranial tumours.\\nMeningioma\\nMeningiomas arise from the cap cell layer of the arachnoid.\\nTheir most common sites are in the front half of the headand include: lateral cerebral convexities, midline along thefalx cerebri adjacent to the major venous sinusesparasagittally, and olfactory groove. Less frequent sites are:within the cerebral ventricles, foramen magnum, cerebello-pontine angle and the spinal cord. Meningiomas are generallysolitary. They have an increased frequency in patients withneurofibromatosis 2 and are often multiple in these cases.They are usually found in 2nd to 6th decades of life, withslight female preponderance. Most meningiomas are benignand can be removed successfully. Rarely, a malignantmeningioma may metastasise, mainly to the lungs.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  meningioma is\\nwell-circumscribed, solid, spherical or hemispherical massof varying size (1-10 cm in diameter). The tumour isgenerally firmly attached to the dura and indents thesurface of the brain but rarely ever invades it (Fig. 30.16) .\\nThe overlying bone usually shows hyperostosis. Cutsurface of the tumour is firm and fibrous, sometimes withfoci of calcification.Microscopically,  meningiomas are divided into 5 sub-\\ntypes: meningotheliomatous (syncytial), fibrous(fibroblastic), transitional (mixed), angioblastic andanaplastic (malignant).\\n1.Meningotheliomatous (syncytial) meningioma.  This\\npattern of meningioma resembles the normal arachnoid\\ncap cells. The tumour consists of solid masses of polygonalcells with poorly-defined cell membranes (i.e. syncytialappearance). The cells have round to oval, central nucleiwith abundant, finely granular cytoplasm. Some amountof collagenous stroma is present that divides the tumourinto irregular lobules.\\n2. Fibrous (fibroblastic) meningioma.  A less frequent\\npattern is of a spindle-shaped fibroblastic tumour in which\\nthe tumour cells form parallel or interlacing bundles.Whorled pattern and psammoma bodies are less commonfeatures of this type.\\n3.\\nTransitional (mixed) meningioma.  This pattern is\\ncharacterised by a combination of cells with syncytial and\\nfibroblastic features with conspicuous whorled pattern oftumour cells, often around central capillary-sized bloodvessels. Some of the whorls contain psammoma bodiesdue to calcification of the central core of whorls (Fig. 30.17) .\\nOther forms of degenerative changes like xanthomatousand myxomatous degeneration may also be encountered,in transitional variety .\\nThese first three histologic patterns constitute a\\nspectrum of lesions rather than three distinct entities.\\n4.Angioblastic meningioma.  An angioblastic menin-\\ngioma includes 2 patterns: haemangioblastic pattern\\nresembling haemangioblastoma of the cerebellum, and\\nhaemangiopericytic pattern  which is indistinguishable from\\nhaemangiopericytoma elsewhere in the body. Both typesof angioblastic meningiomas have high rate of recurrences.Figure 30.16 Meningioma, The tumour mass is circumscribed (arrow) with irregular surface convolutions and prominent blood vessels. It is\\nfirm in consistency with peripherally adherent thick firm dural tissue. Cut surface of the mass is firm and fibrous.\\n891CHAPTER 30 The Nervous System5. Anaplastic (malignant) meningioma.  Rarely, a\\nmeningioma may display features of anaplasia and invade\\nthe underlying brain or spinal cord. This pattern ofmeningioma is associated with extraneural metastases,mainly to the lungs.\\nMETASTATIC  TUMOURS\\nApproximately a quarter of intracranial tumours are\\nmetastatic tumours. The clinical features are like those of a\\nprimary brain tumour. Most common primary tumours\\nmetastasising to the brain are: carcinomas of the lung, breast,\\nskin (malignant melanoma), kidney and the gastrointestinal\\ntract and choriocarcinoma. Infiltration from lymphoma and\\nleukaemias may also occur.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the metastatic\\ndeposits in the brain are usually multiple, sharply-defined\\nmasses at the junction of grey and white matter(Fig. 30.18) . A less frequent pattern is carcinomatous\\nmeningitis or meningeal carcinomatosis in which there ispresence of carcinomatous nodules on the surface of thebrain and spinal cord, particularly encountered incarcinomas of the lung and breast.Histologically,  metastatic tumours in the brain\\nrecapitulate the appearance of the primary tumour oforigin with sharp line of demarcation from adjoining braintissue. It is usually surrounded by a zone of oedema.\\nPERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\\nNORMAL STRUCTURE\\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of cranial and\\nspinal nerves, sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomicnervous system and the peripheral ganglia. The PNS isinvolved in electric transmission of sensory and motorimpulses to and from the CNS. A peripheral nerve issurrounded by an outer layer of fibrous tissue, the epineurium.\\nEach nerve is made of several fascicles enclosed inmultilayered membrane of flattened cells, the perineurium.\\nEach fascicle is composed of bundles of connective tissue,the endoneurium.  There are 2 main types of nerve fibres or\\naxons comprising a peripheral nerve—myelinated and non-myelinated. Myelinated axons  are thicker (diameter greater\\nthan 2 \\nμm) and are surrounded by a chain of Schwann cells\\nwhich produce myelin sheath. Non-myelinated axons  have\\ndiameter of 0.2-3 μm and about ten non-myelinated fibres\\nmay be enclosed by a Schwann cell. Nodes of Ranvier  on myeli-\\nnated fibres are the boundaries between each Schwann cellsurrounding the fibre (Fig. 30.18) . Myelinated axons have\\ntheir origin from neurons in the posterior root ganglia andthe anterior horn cell of the spinal cord, whereas non-myelinated axons arise from neurons in the posterior rootganglia and in the autonomic ganglia.\\nPATHOLOGIC REACTIONS TO INJURY\\nThe peripheral nerves, unlike brain, have regenerative\\ncapacity as has been discussed on page 17 2. The pathologic\\nreactions of the PNS in response to injury may be in theFigure 30.17 Meningioma, transitional type. The cells have features of both syncytial and fibroblastic type and form whorled appearance.\\nSome of the whorls contain psammoma bodies.\\nFigure 30.18 Metastatic tumour deposits in the brain. They are\\ncommonly multiple, well-defined and usually located at the grey and\\nwhite matter junction.\\n892SECTION III Systemic Pathologyform of one of the types of degenerations causing peripheral\\nneuropathy  or formation of a traumatic neuroma. There are\\n3 main types of degenerative processes in the PNS—\\nWallerian degeneration, axonal degeneration and segmentaldemyelination (Fig. 30.19):\\nWALLERIAN DEGENERATION.  Wallerian degeneration\\noccurs after transection of the axon which may be as a resultof knife wounds, compression, traction and ischaemia.Following transection, initially there is accumulation oforganelles in the proximal and distal ends of the transectionsites. Subsequently, the axon and myelin sheath distal to thetransection site undergo disintegration upto the next nodeof Ranvier, followed by phagocytosis. The process of regene-ration occurs by sprouting of axons and proliferation ofSchwann cells from the proximal end.\\nAXONAL DEGENERATION.  In axonal degeneration,\\ndegeneration of the axon begins at the peripheral terminal\\nand proceeds backward towards the nerve cell body. Thecell body often undergoes chromatolysis. There is Schwanncell proliferation in the region of axonal degeneration. Theloss of axonal integrity occurs, probably as a result of someprimary metabolic disturbance within the axon itself.Changes similar to those seen in Wallerian degeneration arepresent but regenerative reaction is limited or absent.\\nSEGMENTAL DEMYELINATION. Segmental demyeli-\\nnation is similar to demyelination within the brain (page 884).\\nSegmental demyelination is loss of myelin of the segmentbetween two consecutive nodes of Ranvier, leaving adenuded axon segment. The axon, however, remains intact.Schwann cell proliferation generally accompanies demyeli-nation. This results in remyelination of the affected axon.Repeated episodes of demyelination and remyelination areassociated with concentric proliferation of Schwann cellsaround axons producing ‘onion bulbs’  found in hypertrophic\\nneuropathy.\\nTRAUMATIC NEUROMA.  Normally, the injured axon of\\na peripheral nerve regenerates at the rate of approximately\\n1 mm per day. However, if the process of regeneration ishampered due to an interposed haematoma or fibrous scar,the axonal sprouts together with Schwann cells andfibroblasts form a peripheral mass called as traumatic orstump neuroma.\\nPERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY\\nPeripheral neuropathy is the term used for disorders of the\\nperipheral nerves of any cause. It may be polyneuropathy,mononeuropathy multiplex, and mononeuropathy.\\nPolyneuropathy  is characteristically symmetrical with\\nnoticeable sensory features such as tingling, pricking,\\nburning sensation or dysaesthesia in feet and toes. Motor\\nfeatures in the form of muscle weakness and loss of tendon\\nreflexes may be present. Involvement of the autonomic\\nnervous system may be associated. Most cases have originin acquired metabolic and toxic causes such as thiaminedeficiency, diabetes, amyloidosis, autoimmune demyelinat-ing disease (Guillain-Barré syndrome), and administrationof toxins and certain therapeutic agents (e.g. vincristine,isoniazid). Besides these, a number of hereditary polyneuro-pathies are described.\\nPathologically,  polyneuropathy may be the result of\\naxonal degeneration (axonopathy) or segmentaldemyelination (demyelinating polyneuropathy). In eachtype, acute, subacute and chronic forms are distinguished.Guillain-Barr é syndrome  is the classical example of acute\\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy which has probably anautoimmune etiology.Figure 30.19 Pathologic reaction of peripheral nerve to injury.\\n893CHAPTER 30 The Nervous SystemMononeuropathy multiplex or multifocal neuropathy\\nis defined as simultaneous or sequential multifocal\\ninvolvement of nerve trunks which are not in continuity. Theinvolvement may be partial or complete and may evolve overdays or years. Multifocal neuropathy represents part ofspectrum of chronic acquired demyelinating neuropathy.\\nMononeuropathy,  on the other hand, is focal involve-\\nment of a single nerve. It is generally the result of local causessuch as direct trauma, compression and entrapment.\\nNERVE SHEATH TUMOURS\\nTumours of the peripheral nerves are commonly benign and\\ninclude schwannoma (neurilemmoma) and neurofibroma.Both of them arise from Schwann cells but neurofibromacontains large amount of collagen. Rarely, their malignantcounterpart, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour,develops particularly in patients with von Recklinghausen’sneurofibromatosis.\\nSchwannomas (Neurilemmomas)\\nSchwannomas or neurilemmomas arise from cranial and\\nspinal nerve roots. An acoustic schwannoma  or acoustic neuroma\\nis an intracranial schwannoma located within the internalauditory canal originating from vestibular portion of theacoustic nerve (page 515). Intraspinal schwannomas  are found\\nas intradural tumours in the thoracic region. In the peripheralnerves, they occur as solitary nodule on any sheathedsensory, motor, or autonomic nerve. Multiple schwannomasare uncommon and occur in von Recklinghausen’s disease(see below). Schwannomas are tumours of adults except invon Recklinghausen’s disease.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  a schwannoma\\nis an encapsulated, solid, sometimes cystic, tumour thatproduces eccentric enlargement of the nerve root fromwhere it arises.Figure 30.20 Schwannoma (neurilemmoma), showing whorls of densely cellular (Antoni A) and loosely cellular (Antoni B) areas with characteris tic\\nnuclear palisading (Verocay bodies).\\nMicroscopically,  the tumour is composed of fibrocellular\\nbundles forming whorled pattern. There are areas of denseand compact cellularity (Antoni A pattern) alternating with\\nloose acellular areas (Antoni B pattern).  Areas of Antoni A\\npattern show palisaded nuclei called Verocay bodies\\n(Fig. 30.20) . Nerve fibres are usually found stretched over\\nthe capsule but not within the tumour. Areas ofdegeneration contain haemosiderin and lipid-ladenmacrophages.\\n Schwann cells characteristically express\\nS-100 protein. A schwannoma rarely ever becomesmalignant.\\nNeurofibromas and von Recklinghausen’s Disease\\nNeurofibromas may occur as solitary, fusiform cutaneous\\ntumour of a single nerve, but more often are multipleassociated with von Recklinghausen’s disease. Solitaryneurofibroma is a tumour of adults but multipleneurofibromas or neurofibromatosis is a hereditary disorderwith autosomal dominant inheritance. Solitary neurofibromais generally asymptomatic but patients with vonRecklinghausen’s disease have a triad of features:\\nMultiple cutaneous neurofibromas.\\nNumerous pigmented skin lesions (‘cafe au lait’ spots).\\nPigmented iris hamartomas.\\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder having\\nmutation in chromosome 17 while type 2 has mutation in\\nchromosome 22.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  neurofibroma is\\nan unencapsulated tumour producing fusiform enlarge-ment of the affected nerve. Neurofibromatosis in vonRecklinghausen’s disease is characterised by numerousnodules of varying size, seen along the small cutaneousnerves but may also be found in visceral branches ofsympathetic nerves. Neurofibromatosis may involve a\\n894SECTION III Systemic Pathologygroup of nerves or may occur as multiple, oval and\\nirregular swellings along the length of a nerve (plexiformneurofibroma)  (Fig. 30.21).\\nMicroscopically,  a neurofibroma is composed of bundles\\nand interlacing fascicles of delicate and elongated spindle-shaped cells having wavy nuclei. The cellular area isseparated by loose collagen and mucoid material. Residualnerve fibres (neurites) may be demonstrable (Fig. 30.22).\\nHistologic appearance of Antoni B pattern of schwannomamay be seen in neurofibroma and cause diagnosticdifficulty. Immunohistochemically, neurofibroma ispositive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and sometumours express S-100 protein as schwannomas do.\\nFigure 30.21 Plexiform neurofibromatosis. The main mass is\\nmultilobulated with increased fat while lower part of the image shows a\\nseparate encapsulated gelatinous mass. Cut surface of both the massesshows circumscribed, gelatinous, lobulated grey-white firm masses.\\nFigure 30.22\\nNeurofibroma, showing interlacing bundles of spindle-shaped cells separated by mucoid matrix. The cells have wavy nuclei and\\na residual nerve fibre (neurite) is also identified.Neurofibromas have tendency for local recurrences\\nafter excision. Neurilemmoma virtually never turns\\nmalignant, while sarcomatous transformation in neuro-fibroma, particularly in neurofibromatosis, is not unusual.It is estimated that about 3% of patients with vonRecklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis develop malignanttransformation of one of the nodules. Rarely, neurogenicsarcoma may develop spontaneously in the absence of pre-existing von Recklinghausen’s disease.\\nThe contrasting features to distinguish neurofibroma\\nfrom schwannoma are listed in  Table 30.5.\\nMalignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath T umour\\nMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) is apoorly differentiated spindle cell sarcoma of the peripheralnerves occurring most often in adults. The tumour may arisede novo  or from malignant transformation of a pre-existing\\nneurofibroma than a schwannoma, generally at an early age(20-40 years). About 50% of the tumours are seen in patientswith neurofibromatosis type 1 with chromosomal deletion17p and p53 gene mutations, while some develop at sites of\\nprevious irradiation.\\nMORPHOLOGIC FEATURES. Grossly,  the tumour\\nappears as an unencapsulated fusiform enlargement of a\\nnerve.\\nMicroscopically,  the tumour has the general appearance\\nof tumour cells resembling a fibrosarcoma. The tumour\\nhas frequent mitosis and areas of necrosis. Triton tumour\\nis the name used for MPNST which has areas of poorly-differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma, cartilage and bone.\\nEpithelioid MPNST  has plump cells resembling\\nepithelioid cells and is positive fo r HMB-45 immuno-\\nstain.

In this section, laboratory values are given in bothconventional and international units. Conversion from onesystem to the other can be done as follows:\\nmmol/L × atomic weight\\nmg/dl = \\n__________________________________\\n     10\\n  mg/dl × 10\\nmmol/L = ___________________\\n  atomic weight\\nAccording to the SI system, the prefixes and conversion\\nfactors for metric units of length, weight and volume aregiven in Table A-2.\\nThe laboratory values given here are divided into three\\nsections: clinical chemistry of blood (Table A-3), other bodyfluids (Table A-4), and haematologic values (Table A-5).
